<p>There are some things that we have learned about the United States from this election. We’ll need to keep these in mind as we make efforts to return sanity to society.</p>
<h3>The federal government has been corrupted<img class="alignnone wp-image-100566" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large-300x212.jpeg" alt="cwxt87xucaasxvf-jpg-large" width="500" height="353" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large-300x212.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large-768x543.jpeg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large-837x592.jpeg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large-667x472.jpeg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large-262x185.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large-574x406.jpeg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwxT87XUcAAsxVf.jpg-large.jpeg 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px">
</h3>
<p>Probably the most shocking lesson of this election is that the entire federal government has been coopted to serve a single party—the Democrats. The best example of this was the behavior of FBI Director James Comey. The FBI is part of the Executive branch of government so Comey reports to Loretta Lynch, who in turn reports to Obama. Despite this fact, one expects that the FBI be allowed a high degree of discretion to honestly investigate individuals regardless of which political party they belong to. After all, the US was founded upon the idea that we are all equal before the law.</p>
<p>Comey’s actions reveal that the FBI has thrown equality before the law out the window. At first the FBI investigated Clinton’s use of an unsecure, personal email server to conduct national business while she was Secretary of State. But even though Clinton apparently violated several laws that have gotten other people severe jail sentences, Comey exonerated her back in July with a hand slap.</p>
<p>In a move that surprised everyone, Comey re-opened on October 28th the criminal investigation of Clinton after 650,000 emails State Department emails were found on pervert Anthony Weiner’s computer. Trump supporters rejoiced and Hillary supporters expressed outrage. But the White House calmly called Comey “a man of integrity.” Did they know something we didn’t?</p>
<p>It turns out the fix was in from the beginning because <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-comey-clinton-emails-20161106-story.html">just 48 hours before election day, Comey exonerated Clinton</a> <em>again</em>. The FBI director likely intended to clear Clinton of wrongdoing before the election to defuse Donald Trump’s criticism of her.</p>
<p>The big lesson is that the law is applied selectively. Wealthy, politically-connected people don’t need to play by the same rules as everyone else. Unless this situation is corrected, it means the rule of law is dead—and that is a very grave lesson indeed.</p>
<h3>The elites are in control but…</h3>

<p>I’ve written many times about the control that globalist elites exert on the country through their control of the media, educational institutions, and politicians through the form of bribes (donations, cushy job offers, speaking fees). By controlling the flow of information and setting the narrative, the globalists are able to control the masses like cattle. The good news is that their control is not complete. They are not omnipotent.</p>
<p>The weakness of the elites has been demonstrated in three ways. The first was with the Brexit vote. When Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to hold a referendum on the UK’s membership in the EU, he never dreamed that Britons would actually vote to leave. All the polls at the time showed that any movement to leave would go down in flames. Still, through the work of men like Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson, the British populace voted to leave the EU. The Brits on the leave side had to endure being called racist and look past polling that said they had no chance to win.</p>

<p>The second way was the campaign of Trump himself. The GOP had planned a coronation for Jeb Bush. The rest of the GOP field was “me too” candidates who were virtually indistinguishable from Jeb. Trump came in with an uncompromising message and crushed Jeb and the rest of the little Jebs. The elite plan to have Hillary versus a weak conservative was completely thrown into disarray by Trump’s campaign. Even if Trump has lost the general, it is still a victory because now, instead of seeing the Great Oz, we see the globalists behind the curtain.</p>
<p>The third manifestation of the weakness of the elites is the rise of the Alt Right. A tiny group of young people on the internet was able to quickly wake up large segments of the population. Only a year ago, terms like nationalism and globalism were rarely heard in the US. Now, we have grandmothers in Texas tweeting about how we need to lay the axe to the globalists.</p>
<p>The overall lesson is that we should not fear the globalist elite. They exist and they are able to fool a majority of the population, but not all of us. With sound strategy, they can be defeated.</p>
<h3>The Elite have completely divorced themselves from non-elites</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-100572" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwcYTA3VEAAJ4jX-300x387.jpg" alt="cwcyta3veaaj4jx" width="375" height="484" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwcYTA3VEAAJ4jX-300x387.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwcYTA3VEAAJ4jX-262x338.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwcYTA3VEAAJ4jX-574x740.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CwcYTA3VEAAJ4jX.jpg 615w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px"></p>
<p>In the past, Europe had an aristocracy. This aristocracy had a close relationship with the rest of the people in the country. The aristocracy was expected to defend the nation in case of war. They also had the same religion as the rest of the country. We already knew that the modern “aristocracy” of the globalist elites has no responsibilities toward the rest of us, but, thanks to WikiLeaks, we have now learned that they don’t even share the same religion.</p>
<p>WikiLeaks revealed that Hillary Clinton and her campaign manager are close friends with Marina Abramovic, a Serbian artist who performs occult rituals she calls “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/100445/is-hillary-clintons-entourage-involved-in-a-satanic-pedophile-ring">spirit cooking</a>.” Spirit cooking appears to be set of magical rituals that use bodily fluids such as menstrual blood, urine, and semen to achieve certain goals, usually sex-related. It also involves at least minor sacrifices: one “recipe” calls for cutting one’s figure and “eat[ing] the pain.”</p>
<p>While spirit cooking is certainly grotesque, it is not my intention to focus on it except to point out that it has become a sort of initiation ritual into the US globalist elite. Hillary Clinton, John Podesta, Jay-Z and Beyonce, Lady Gaga, and Gwen Stefani have all attended these rituals and I would not be surprised to learn that many other politicians, CEOs, and bankers also participate. Getting invited to one of these spirit cooking sessions means that you have gained entry into the wealthy elite in the US. There are probably similar groups or rituals for the modern day European elites.</p>
<p>There are several things at work here. Most of the spirit cooking participants probably don’t believe in the efficacy of the spirit cooking ritual. It is more like a college fraternity initiation. It only means something in terms of one’s social standing. Also, the satanic imagery of spirit cooking and its sexual overtones are big middle fingers to Christianity which our elite regard as the religion of the unwashed masses.</p>
<p>In both of these ways, our modern “elite” have separated themselves from the rest of us. They don’t share the same destiny as us. If the country starts going to hell, the wealthy elite can just pick up and move to another country or they can live in small, heavily guarded compounds, untouched by the damage their policies have caused. And they even lack a common morality with us. In their own eyes, their wealth has somehow put them beyond the traditional moral code that guides the rest of us.<br>
The fact that the elites have no regard for the rest of the country does not bode well for them. The aristocracy of old knew that their fortune was bound up with that of their countrymen. The modern elite lack this wisdom. Once enough of the <em>hoi polloi</em> realize it, it is only a matter of time before these pseudo-elites are deposed from their pedestal.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>With Trump’s election, the problem of federal government being used for political purposes will be mitigated. However, the problems with our indulgent pseudo-elite will continue to be a force that prevents the patriarchy from returning. In any case, we can be grateful that the election of 2016 has exposed some of the cancers that are eating away at our society.</p>
