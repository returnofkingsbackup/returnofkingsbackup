<p>Recently I read a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/100396/11-best-quotes-from-donald-trumps-art-of-the-deal" target="_blank">post by Roosh</a> on Donald Trump’s most popular book and memoir, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0399594493/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481318870&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=art+of+the+deal&amp;tag=rok0f-20">The Art of the Deal</a></em>. In this article, Roosh presented 11 of his favorite quotes from the book—and while these quotes are extremely applicable to business and life, I also believe that they’re applicable to game.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: women are attracted to characteristics that make you successful. This is not coincidence, it’s biology—they’re hardwired to desire men with <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/live-dream-life-bitter-truth/" target="_blank">characteristics like decisiveness</a>, assertiveness, confidence, and persistence. The reason being that men with characteristics such as these can almost always successfully protect and provide for a woman.</p>
<p>So, with this in mind, let’s take a look at how Donald Trump’s 11 best quotes from “The Art of the Deal” will help you grab ’em by the pussy.</p>
<h4>Trust your gut</h4>
<blockquote><p>…listen to your gut, no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you’re generally better off sticking with what you know.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an absolute necessity. Too many times have I seen men who have a bad feeling about a woman, but because she’s hot they end up dating her anyways. This is a complete rookie mistake; the game veteran learns to always trust his instincts, no matter how good something may seem.</p>
<p>I discussed this in a previous article, but the idea is that every woman has a certain “energy,” to her. Some women may have a good energy, which is indicated by compassion, femininity, and nurturing tendencies. Others, however, have a bad energy: manipulativeness, dramatic behavior, and jealousy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/fourth-energetic-law-live-life-want/" target="_blank">Learning to read these energies</a> is extremely important, and to do this, you must trust your gut instinct. If your gut tells you that a woman is a catch, then she probably is. If your gut tells you that she’s trouble, then she’s probably just that.</p>
<h4>Think big</h4>
<p><img class=" wp-image-36158" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hot-girls-sexy-girls-173-237x300.jpg" alt="Privet! I am Fappina Bigsexyassowski" width="296" height="375"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I’m after. Sometimes I settle for less than I sought, but in most cases I still end up with what I want.</p>
<p>[…]I wasn’t satisfied just to earn a good living. I was looking to make a statement. I was out to build something monumental—something worth a big effort.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I swear, it’s almost like Trump wrote this book specifically for game. He aims very high, and then just keeps pushing and pushing to get what he’s after. Yes, sometimes he settles for less, but in most cases he ends up with what he wants.</p>
<p>Is this not the quintessential aspect of game? You aim high by choosing a gorgeous woman you want, and you remain persistent despite her shit tests and playing hard to get. Obviously “just keep pushing and pushing,” doesn’t mean to rape her, but rather to be persistent.</p>
<p>Persistence is a major key with women, but it’s also where most men screw up. Most men interpret being persistent as being needy, but they’re entirely different. You can persist, but not chase a girl. You can persist, but not be needy. It simply comes down to not wanting her validation, but being willing to put in effort for what you want.</p>
<h4>Don’t be desperate</h4>
<p><img class=" wp-image-106205" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-300x157.jpg" alt="Officially cucked, like many men in this country." width="422" height="221" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-300x157.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-768x402.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-1200x627.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-837x438.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-667x349.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-262x137.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart-574x300.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Justin-Trudeau-heart.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px"></p>
<blockquote><p>The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you’re dead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wanting a woman so badly that you’re willing to sacrifice your dignity is a recipe for disaster. One of the first things that men learn upon practicing game is that you can never appear to be too desperate. When a woman finds out that you’re desperate for her approval, you’ve immediately lost her.</p>
<p>And what’s worse is that desperately craving a woman’s attention invites all sorts of other nasty things into your life: cheating, divorce, financial ruin, and more. When a woman realizes that she can use you, again and again, but you’re too desperate to care, “then you’re dead,” as Trump says.</p>
<h4>Care about the cents</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-96821" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0-300x195.jpg" alt="donaldthrowingmoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0" width="446" height="290" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0-300x195.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0-262x171.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0-574x374.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px"></p>
<blockquote><p>To this day, if I feel a contractor is overcharging me, I’ll pick up the phone, even if it’s only for $5,000 or $ 10,000, and I’ll complain. People say to me, “What are you bothering for, over a few bucks?” My answer is that the day I can’t pick up the telephone and make a twenty-five-cent call to save $10,000 is the day I’m going to close up shop.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one is very applicable to being in a relationship with a woman. A lot of the time, she’ll gain your trust, but the second that you give her your credit card she’ll start to abuse it—this is a huge red flag, because it demonstrates that she doesn’t respect your money.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Usually a woman will come up with some lame excuse as to why she spent money you didn’t give her permission to spend. Maybe she desired to splurge on a $200 pair of shoes, and her excuse is that she wants something nice to wear when you take her out. Or maybe she spent $500 when you only gave her permission to spend $300, because “they were having a sale.”</p>
<p>Don’t tolerate this type of behavior, because she’s lying to you and manipulating you. As Trump says, the day that you can’t spend a little bit of effort to prevent someone from overcharging you, is the day that you need to close up shop.</p>
<h4>Use scarcity</h4>
<blockquote><p>With so much demand, our marketing strategy was to play hard to get. It was a reverse sales technique. If you sit in an office with a contract in your hand, eager to make the first deal that comes along, it’s quite obvious to people that the apartments aren’t in demand. We were never in a rush to sign a contract. When people came in, we’d show them the model apartments, sit down and talk, and, if they were interested, explain that there was a waiting list for the most desirable apartments. The more unattainable the apartments seemed, the more people wanted them.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one is absolutely massive. Any time a woman feels like you could leave at any moment, she will magically start respect your time and treating you ever so sweetly. When a woman intuits that you have 20 other girls that want to sleep with you, she’ll view you as an extremely scarce resource.</p>
<p>If you’re in a huge rush to seal the deal, she’ll most likely sense that you don’t get laid very often. Now, this isn’t the same as moving fast and escalating, but rather it’s the underlying emotion behind it. Never communicate to a woman that SHE’S the one who’s scarce (AKA you’re not sleeping with any other girls). She wants YOU to be the scarce one, and she wants to feel like you’re choosing her over all of your other girls.</p>
<h4>There’s always a time to strike</h4>
<blockquote><p>The worst of times often create the best opportunities to make good deals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regardless of what you may think, there’s always a good time to strike with a woman. In fact, some of my most memorable pulls have been at ridiculous times that would’ve seemed extremely inconvenient to most men.</p>
<p>I recall being at a party a while back, and this platinum blonde girl was very clearly into me, despite her boyfriend being at the party. Unfortunately, however, we didn’t have the logistics to get back to my place and all of the rooms were locked. So what did I do? I pulled her to the bathroom, and fucked her on the floor—she was into it, too (asked me to call her a slut and choke her).</p>
<p>The point is, however, that I recognized my time to strike. I saw that as everyone was occupied with their own social matters, this girl was right next to me and eager to have sex. So, I struck while the iron was hot. I figured out a way to make it work, despite the difficult logistics.</p>
<h4>Surround yourself with the best</h4>

<blockquote><p>I have a very simple rule when it comes to management: hire the best people from your competitors, pay them more than they were earning, and give them bonuses and incentives based on their performance. That’s how you build a first-class operation.</p></blockquote>
<p>This can be applied to either women, or more importantly, men. Surrounding yourself with the best of women is great—it will give you an abundance mentality, get you lots of great sex, and more importantly, put you in an <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/succeed-everything-using-upward-spirals/" target="_blank">upward spiral to success.</a></p>
<p>Surrounding yourself with the best of men, however, is far more important. The best way to learn is through osmosis—this is true for everything, especially game. No amount of reading theory online can substitute for actually being “in field” with a player.</p>
<p>I recall being a pickup newbie, and how I literally waited for 10 hours just to shake a successful PUA’s hand and have a 30 second conversation with him. Was this foolish of me? A stupid man might think so, but in reality, it was extremely worth it.</p>
<p>Why? Because the man’s notch count was well over 500, he owned an 8 figure business, and most importantly, he was the happiest person I’d ever met. Just having that 30 seconds of osmosis taught me more about being successful than hours of reading content. If you want to have good game, you must surround yourself with guys who have good game.</p>
<h4>Create win-win deals</h4>
<blockquote><p>Deals work best when each side gets something it wants from the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though I don’t care about real estate development, the book was hard to put down. I enjoyed reading about how Trump dealt with problems that would have stymied lesser men. If you are a fan of Trump and want to understand the forces that drive him, I highly recommend this book.</p>
<p>A lot of the time, guys who first hear about the manosphere community think that game is manipulative. What they don’t realize, however, is that it’s actually a win-win. Game, at its most basic level, teaches you to be an emotionally healthy man who can intuit what women feel, and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Game is a win-win, because both men AND women benefit from it. Men benefit by having access to higher quality women. Women benefit, because there’s more men that can make them laugh, have fun, and feel good. Game is not about taking something from a woman, but rather creating an experience that you both enjoy—and that, my friends, is a true win-win deal.</p>
