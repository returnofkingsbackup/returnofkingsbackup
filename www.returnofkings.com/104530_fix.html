<p>What to eat, what medicines to take, what scientific theories to believe in, what to think of men and women, what to think of the races, what to think of gay people, who to vote for, what to make of Russia. Your opinions on hundreds of topics have been shaped by journalists, scientific “experts,” pundits, and politicians who have cozy positions in the establishment hierarchy. We’re led to believe that the information they share with us is truthful and in our best interest, but what if they’ve been lying to us about this, that, and, well, everything else?</p>
<p>The first lie you encountered is probably the lie that men and women are equal. Through your dating experiences, you came to see clear differences in male and female behavior that show women are not the flawless, independent, and strong yet innocent angels that the establishment portrays them as, and that <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-true-nature-of-women">their true nature</a> is quite destructive if not constrained by societal forces. You would be correct to assume that this is not the only lie you’ve been told.</p>
<p>Imagine you have had a wife of ten years. You just discovered that she lied to you about where she was and who she was with the night before. What is the most logical conclusion to follow after discovering her lie?</p>
<ul>
<li>That this was the only time she has lied to you in ten years OR</li>
<li>That she has probably lied before, especially when concerning her nighttime activities, so more investigation is in order</li>
</ul>
<p>Discovering a lie is almost always the tip of an iceberg that there have been additional lies which—at the minimum—relate to the initial lie. In your wife’s case, it is unlikely this is the first time she’s lying about what she’s doing at night.</p>
<h4>Why they lie</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-98563" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/667x582xzz-liepinoch1.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.0F5XuZEoox.jpg" alt="667x582xzz-liepinoch1-jpg-pagespeed-ic-0f5xuzeoox" width="274" height="239" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/667x582xzz-liepinoch1.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.0F5XuZEoox.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/667x582xzz-liepinoch1.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.0F5XuZEoox-300x262.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/667x582xzz-liepinoch1.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.0F5XuZEoox-262x229.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/667x582xzz-liepinoch1.jpg.pagespeed.ic_.0F5XuZEoox-574x501.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px"></p>
<p>The establishment’s lie about women is essential for them to push national laws and policies, including <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/social-welfare-creates-a-society-of-sluts">social welfare</a>, sexual harassment laws, rape laws, Title IX, university funding to gender studies departments, and so on. This means that the lie is useful for those at the top to advance <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-end-goal-of-western-progressivism-is-depopulation">their specific agenda</a>. Just like with the wife we caught in a lie, we can conclude that any “fact” the establishment has given us, which is used to shape national law and policy, is almost certainly a lie. In addition, any “fact” that allows corporate interests to gain extra billions of dollars in profit per year has also been a lie.</p>
<p>The wife lies because her marriage and well-being is at stake. The establishment shill lies because their trillion-dollar agendas are at stake. The scientist lies because his corporate sponsor has billions of dollars at stake. When you are given “facts” about an issue where there is an agenda or money on the line, you are almost certainly being lied to. You are being given a carefully constructed piece of information with the intention to allow the agenda to proceed or the money to flow. You must therefore either reject the “fact” or research the issue to come to the truth.</p>
<p>Here are just a few things where we are not getting truthful information from the establishment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Political candidates</li>
<li>Food safety and nutrition (GMO and pesticide safety, etc)</li>
<li>Chemicals in hygiene products</li>
<li>Plastics and their estrogenic effects</li>
<li>Treatment for heart disease and cancer</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-novelty-wheel">Human happiness</a></li>
<li>Feminism</li>
<li>Mental health of gays and transsexuals</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-theory-of-evolution-does-not-apply-to-modern-human-beings">Theory of evolution</a></li>
<li>Benefits of the service economy and technology</li>
<li><a href="http://www.rooshv.com/are-there-differences-in-race">Race</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rooshv.com/cultural-collapse-theory">Tradition and religion</a></li>
<li>International trade</li>
<li>The Middle East and Russia</li>
<li>Black Lives Matter</li>
</ul>
<p>Government and corporations need at least some consent from the public to push their policies, agendas, and products. Where does consent come from? Public opinion and beliefs. Where does public opinion and beliefs come from? The government and corporations, who also outright control or directly impact the universities and media. Round the wheel of human control we go.</p>
<h4>They need you to believe in lies</h4>

<p>While bludgeoning you over the head with a club and telling you to eat your GMO corn and soy may work in the short term, it’s an ineffective long-term method to get you to eat the product. Much better to wrap up the GMO poison in catchy advertising, pay famous people to promote your product, sponsor scientists to do studies where only the desired result is published, and lobby for laws that prevent you from even knowing you’re eating GMO corn. Most people cannot resist such a multi-front assault on their mind.</p>

<p>Recently, an examination of psychological studies show that <strong><a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-tried-to-replicate-100-psychology-experiments-and-64-failed">most are complete bullshit</a></strong>. They cannot be replicated. That’s only psychology, you may be thinking, and more important matters like medical research are more rigorous. Wrong, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1002165">medical research is just as bad</a>. If you’re taking an expensive treatment for a serious disease, chances are you’re ingesting something that is no better than just drinking cough syrup. If you consider that a successful study will mean billions in profits for a single drug, I wouldn’t be shocked if you told me that 80% of published medical research is complete bunk. There’s just too much money at stake for them to depend on honestly alone.</p>
<p>Telling you to open up your veins for toxic medicine won’t work unless I have the “scientific studies” to “prove” its effective and safe. Much better to pay a dozen scientists with crushing mortgages and car payments to construct studies where my drug will perform well, and just shred the studies when it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Telling you to submit to women and to give up your legal rights when it comes to sexual assault wouldn’t be a smart way to push an agenda that weakens men and destroys the family unit. Much better to get “social scientists” to make up statistics on rape and wages, hire homely female journalists who resent beautiful women to publish mountains of garbage, have the media invent rape hoaxes that portray men as violent savages, and have politicians push “equality” laws that only benefit one group while marginalizing the other.</p>
<p>With every issue of significance, there are multi-layered efforts to shape your belief on the issue so you don’t resist when the final policy, agenda, or product is pushed. Since you were a child, your mind has been relentlessly hammered with lies on dozens of issues so that you go along with the charade to increase the power and wealth of select individuals who have grand plans and trillions of dollars at stake.</p>
<p>Because I’ve caught my wife in a lie not just once, but several times, I can no longer believe her. I should divorce her, but we can’t divorce an establishment that involves tens of thousands of useful idiots, from obese government bureaucrats to Marxist journalists, who are playing the game to get their own measly share of the pie while those powerful figures above them ensure that their lucrative interests are not compromised. If you’re forced to stay with a lying wife, what will you think when she comes home late tonight with alcohol on her breath saying that she had tea with a girlfriend? You’d think she was a cheating bitch, that’s what, and you can’t wait for the moment when you can throw her to the curb for good.</p>
<h4>How we can arrive at truth</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-66149" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix.jpg" alt="matrix" width="454" height="187" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix.jpg 1432w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix-300x124.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix-1200x494.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix-837x345.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix-667x275.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix-262x108.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/matrix-574x236.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px"></p>
<p>If the establishment is lying to us about everything that they have a major stake in, how can we arrive at the truth? By examining the opposite conclusion and see if it holds water. I did this with the theory of evolution and found, through my own research, that there are enough flaws in evolution to make me<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-theory-of-evolution-does-not-apply-to-modern-human-beings"> doubt the theory</a> as the sole means for arriving at a new species, and that the adoption of this theory was an all-to-convenient way for the elites to destroy traditional societies that believed in God so that they can replace it with a rootless materialist society. While some parts of evolution may be true, I reject the theory as merely a useful tool to destroy tradition, and I refuse to give my consent to any policy, product, or medicine that uses it alone to arrive at its version of facts.</p>
<p>Once you accept that the establishment is lying to you, there will be an uncomfortable void within your mind. You crave facts and truthful knowledge, but no longer have any institution to trust. This opens the door to believing in unproved theories, some of which may be accurate but lack rigorous evidence. And this is the crisis of men today: the time and money it takes to arrive at the truth, and the lack of it in the establishment, means we will be unable to know the truth for most things. You have to merely feel gracious if you happen to arrive at ultimate truth on this topic or that, such as the true nature of women. Or you can just try asking your grandparents, for what they believed in likelier to be closer to actual truth than what we’re been brainwashed with today.</p>
<p>My “wife” has lied to me too many times. If she comes to me with a tall tale, I won’t believe it. Until truth-tellers are made out to be heroes in our society instead of being persecuted and attacked like they are now, it’s safe to disregard <strong><em>everything</em> </strong>they say. Every study, every white paper, every media article is propaganda, meant to get me to agree to the plans they have in store for me, you, and our fellow man. They’ve lied to me for so long that not only will I not believe them, but I will look at the opposite of what they say and see if there’s evidence to prove that instead, until one day, I hope, I can finally divorce them for good.</p>
