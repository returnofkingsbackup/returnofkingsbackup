<p>To be truthful, I was unconsciously looking forward to “Rogue One.”  I say “unconscious” because what handful of trailers I saw of it did pique my interest, but movies, and particularly Star Wars, have been so heavily imbued with politics I’ve been conditioned to tune them out completely.  Ergo, it takes a really good trailer, full of action, X-Wings, Death Stars, and AT-AT’s to pierce this conditioning and get me to take note.</p>
<p>While Rogue One’s trailers did manage to achieve this, I also unconsciously noted that the heroes had more colors than a rainbow.  And when this observation was combined with my previous knowledge of how Hollywood, and particularly Star Wars, was going to force a PC narrative into their movies, Rogue One went back on the “meh” list of movies I’ll probably never get around to watching.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://twitter.com/brettwhite">Brett White</a>.</p>
<p>If the multi-ethnic, multi-color Reading-Rainbow-Rebel heroes of Rogue One (headed up by a “strong-independent woman™”, BTW) wasn’t a clue as to how there was going to be a political lecture, a blatant statement by one of Rogue One’s writers, Brett White, was:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I look at the ‘Rogue One’ trailers, I see what I want from America. I see a multicultural group standing strong together led by a rebellious and courageous woman. That’s what we are working towards, and what we will continue to work towards no matter what. That’s what America – a land created as a haven for the persecuted, to be able to realize their limitless dreams – was created to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, you cannot hold responsible the score of writers and hundreds of employees working on Rogue One for the statements of just one of their writers.  Additionally, one low-ranking writer’s political opinion about a movie, does not mean the movie will be political.  But when two more (higher-ranked) writers <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/rogue-one-writers-connect-election-star-wars-empire-193501053.html">condoned White’s statement, and further hinted that The Empire was a white supremacist organization</a>, you knew Rogue One was going to be (yet <strong><em>another</em></strong>) SJW sermon against “evil” white males and the merits of women and minorities because…uhhhh…”vagina” and <a href="http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/7F.html">melanin</a>.</p>
<p>Now I don’t know about you, but I certainly get my fill of politics during the normal course of a week.  It’s part of my job, it’s part of my hobby, not to mention, politics is forced in front of everyone everywhere be it social media, traditional media, your friends, or literature.  Combine this with a mind-numbing job, a taxing commute, and the toils of everyday life, the <strong><em>absolute last thing</em></strong> people need in their few and precious moments of entertainment and fun is politics.  You would think providers of entertainment and fun would know this, and would be smart enough to leave politics out of it, much like a Thanksgiving dinner.  But they don’t.  They insist on forcing it down the audience’s throat, almost as if they’re compelled by some other, ulterior force, all while risking alienating people with their politics.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The answer to that lies in a combination of writers like Brett White and Star Wars itself.</p>
<h4>Modern Art</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-105141" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/walker-300x149.jpg" alt="walker" width="300" height="149" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/walker-300x149.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/walker-262x130.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/walker.jpg 319w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Modern art is a phenomenon in society where the cart has been put before the horse.  Traditionally art was made to be appealing to society and the market (it was something people wanted).  This ensured that what art was made was of high quality, in demand, of good taste, and also ensured what we would see in public (paintings, murals, buildings, architecture, landscaping, statues, etc.) would be beautiful.  But making good art requires talent.  It also takes labor, toil, practice, failure, enduring, thought, contemplation, and work.  So if you were going to become a successful artist you would have to really put forth your heart, soul, effort, toil, blood, sweat and tears into this passion.</p>
<p>Sadly, all of that is antithetical to being a leftist.  Leftists, SJW’s, liberals, democrats, and other varied forms of socialists are PRIMARILY DEFINED by their laziness and crippling fear of real work.  But they are also egotists which means they don’t care whether they have the ability, talent, determination, or work ethic required to become great artists.  They simply insist on becoming artists.  These two presumably mutually exclusive positions would result in something having to give.  Either the leftist would have to put forth the toil and effort to make great art, or give up on art altogether and pursue another field.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>However, the ego of a leftist is more powerful than reality, and so what has happened is leftists have redefined what makes good art, putting the cart before the horse.  Specifically, art is no longer about whether you created something that is genuinely artistic or beautiful, but the political message it conveys.  This is why nearly all modern art is completely shit, but there is ALWAYS a “political message” that leans to the left attached to them (and this is not speculation or conjecture on my part, just look it up.  Go to any art museum today and see if there isn’t a political message jammed down your throat).  It is this messages that allows the lazy and talentless to become “artists” (in their minds anyway) without having to put forth the effort to actually become one.</p>
<p>And this is epitomized by Brett White.</p>
<p>Understand Brett White (and what I would speculate to be the majority of writers for Rogue One) are talentless hacks substituting politics in for their laziness and genuine lack of artistic skill.  This is further reinforced in that the real work, the real heavy lifting for Rogue One has already been done in that it is simply a remake of George Lucas’ original work.</p>
<p>In my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aaron-clarey/curse-free-episode-13">latest podcast</a> I aliken this to Gordon Ramsey creating a masterpiece dish using his own recipe, but then Brett White comes in, adds some <del>vagina</del> parsley garnish to the side, and claims it as his own.  This is even worse than what’s going on in today’s modern art world in that usually you have to make a shitty piece of art and stand by it as you attach some leftist political message to it.  But the Brett Whites of the world <em>aren’t even doing that</em>.  They’re taking <em>other people’s templates</em> and attaching their shitty (and tiring) anti-white male leftist political message to them.  But the larger point is to realize this is why politics are constantly forced into movies where they don’t belong – these leftists’ egos and fear of real work are stronger and more important to them than your enjoyment and entertainment.  And<a href="http://captaincapitalism.blogspot.com/2016/07/ghostbusters-officially-flop.html"> they’re going ruin it for you</a> whether you like it or not.</p>
<h4>Brett Is Merely A Microcosm Of Hollywood</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-105142" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hollywood.jpg" alt="hollywood" width="284" height="177" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hollywood.jpg 284w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hollywood-262x163.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 284px) 100vw, 284px"></p>
<p>We can pick on Brett all we want (and I will because I and about 60 million other white males are done being accused of evil because of “melanin and penis” by talentless, worthless people like him), but Brett and Rogue One’s anti-white male politics is merely Hollywood’s confession that they are plumb out of talent, intelligence, originality, innovation or ability.  They are so incapable of coming up with new ideas that, like a<a href="http://www.walkerart.org/"> talentless trustfund baby minimalist artist</a>, their only idea is to “add leftist/racist politics” to an already existing work of art.  It’s nothing more than an inferior scumbag “tagging” the Mona Lisa with political-graffiti because they lack the real talent to make something as great as the original.  And it’s proven by all the <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/21-jump-street-female-spinoff-director-rodney-rothman-1201931514/">remakes</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1289401/">reboots</a>, and <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/11/media/oceans-eight-all-women-cast/index.html">sequels</a> Hollywood is making.</p>
<p>Of course, ironically, because the original dish of Star Wars was so good, the mindless sheeple of America, particularly white males, will show up in droves to be lectured about their cardinal sin of being born white and male.  Hollywood, leftist pundits, and no doubt the writers themselves will erroneously view this as vindication of their political message, and double down on the anti-white male/pro-leftist formula for their next movie.  But for you “conservative” and “libertarian” keyboard warriors who were all pro-Trump, and adamant about replacing diversity with meritocracy and “making America great again,” we’ll see if you can actually make a *huge* sacrifice and forego watching Rogue One.  Because if your addiction to Starbucks and Apple products is any indication I’m predicting you cucks will gladly line up, bend over, and let Hollywood fuck you one more time up the ass because</p>
<p>“<em>but but but….it’s <strong>STAR WARS!</strong></em>”</p>
<p>***CORRECTION***</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that Brett White is NOT indeed a writer for the Star Wars film, just merely a writer cited in the article writing about Star Wars.  I wanted to make this clarification, but still do not believe (due to the tacit endorsement from actual writers in Rogue One) this changes the fundamental point of the article.  I will reconsider my thoughts if it turns out the Evil Empire in “Rogue One” is chock full of an equivalent amount of minorities and women and does NOT portray the evil empire as a white male organization…which I’m absolutely sure they will in an honest application of diversity to both heroes and criminals alike.</p>
