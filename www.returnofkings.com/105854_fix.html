<p class="p1">In Canada, self-defense has now been implicitly declared sexist by the incumbent liberals at Parliament Hill. While Canada’s extremely tight gun control laws are well-known, <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/man-faces-jail-after-protecting-home-from-masked-attackers">the extent to which self-defense is disrespected and stigmatized in this country</a> is remarkably overlooked.</p>
<p class="p1">Recently, Canadian Liberal Patty Hajdu, Trudeau crony and anointed “Minister of Status of Women,” <a href="http://ipolitics.ca/2016/12/02/hajdu-calls-leitchs-pepper-spray-proposal-offensive-to-women/">defended the current laws</a>. She insisted that legalizing the use of mace and pepper spray as self-defense was “offensive” as it put “the onus on women to defend themselves rather than focusing on addressing and preventing gender-based violence.”</p>
<p class="p1">That’s when I lowered the newspaper and asked myself out loud: <em>wait, it’s illegal here to carry pepper spray? </em>Unbeknownst to me, Canada’s Criminal Code (the same code that, via Bill C-16, may eventually enforce the use of illegible, fictitious non-binary gender pronouns) states, <a href="http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-98-462/FullText.html">under the Firearms Act of 1995</a>, that it is prohibited and illegal to carry pepper spray or “any device designed to be used for the purpose of injuring, immobilizing or otherwise incapacitating any person”.</p>
<div id="attachment_106228" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-106228" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Accused.jpg" alt="Canada's self-defense laws are not only unbalanced, they protect the would-be criminals more than our law-abiding citizens." width="500" height="323" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Accused.jpg 620w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Accused-300x194.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Accused-262x169.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Accused-574x370.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Canada’s self-defense laws are not only unbalanced, they protect the would-be criminals more than our law-abiding citizens.</p>
</div>
<p class="p1">Not a person intent on injuring, immobilizing, or otherwise incapacitating you, of course. Not a person intent on raping your mother, sister, or girlfriend. Not a person intent on mugging you after they sock you in the teeth (at best). Not them, the law prohibits.</p>
<p class="p1">Inadvertently, this law empowers the criminals, because… they’re criminals and will break the law, anyway. The law puts otherwise law-abiding men and women at risk of breaking the law, and criminally liable for defending themselves with a non-lethal means from a potentially lethal attack.</p>
<h4 class="p1">“Common sense” gun laws are not necessarily sensible</h4>
<p class="p1">To add some tragic irony to this, the Firearms Act of 1995 was passed by Jean Chrétien’s liberals in response to the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre of 14 women by an embittered, Elliot Rodger-styled misogynist. The act aimed to forestall future mass shootings, even though these tragedies or individual shootings in general <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/why-canada-has-a-gun-problem/article29642837/">have since not been reduced.</a></p>
<p class="p1">In addition to this irony, of all the firearms prohibited in this act, the Mini-14 hunting rifle used by the Polytechnique madman to shoot 28 people (and kill 14 women) is classified as a “non-restricted firearm,” meaning it can be legally owned for private use like hunting and can be stored and transported with only a license and not a permit. You can buy a Mini-14 used at a local gun shop—if you can find one.</p>
<p class="p1">Thus, Canada’s “common sense” gun laws state that citizens eligible to bear arms can (as liberally as the law permits) purchase, store, and transport a type of rifle that was used to commit a heinous crime, but cannot legally buy and use “mace” or “pepper spray” to thwart one. Needless to say, Canada’s self-defense laws are laden with unjust double standards and a highly broad and confused logical framework.</p>
<p class="p1">While I understand regulating the sale, use and ownership of firearms, Canada is a good example of how “common sense” gun control can trickle down to basic self-defense laws and render them nonsensical. It can also lead to incomprehensible and plainly unjust applications of the law that, ultimately, empower the nefarious actions of would-be criminals.</p>
<h4 class="p1">There is one glimmer of hope…</h4>
<p class="p1">Cue Kellie Leitch, <a href="http://www.metronews.ca/news/canada/2016/12/01/kellie-leitch-mace-pepper-spray.html">Conservative Party of Canada leadership hopeful. Recently, she proposed revising the Criminal Code</a> so that it legalized the use of mace and pepper spray for self-defense. Leitch impartially made this a matter for all Canadians; she did, however, angle her motion towards the issue of sexual and physical violence against women (even though there are many forms of violent crime<a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2015001/article/14241-eng.htm"> </a><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/85-002-x/2015001/article/14241-eng.htm">that affect both genders varyingly</a>).</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And granted, I do not picture men using mace for self-defense in the first place (though we should have every right to do so). When accosted, us fellas tend to be very direct and confrontational; our method of self-defense is typically measured so that it is proportionate to the threat. A moderate threat may be met with a little Taekwondo (or your choice of martial art) and a severe one with a more extreme, possibly lethal force—like a firearm (insert: Canadian<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>frantically patting empty waistband).</span></p>
<p class="p1">If you do not have time or cannot afford martial arts training, you can legally buy “dog and coyote attack deterrent” or “bear repellent” at Canadian Tire or a local army surplus store. I bought my girlfriend one in case she’s walking home and needs to deter a “coyote.”</p>

<h4 class="p1">Once again, it’s not really about equality</h4>
<p class="p1">Following that illogic, pepper spray is sexist to women, but dog deterrent is not animal cruelty to dogs. Whether a man or woman is attacked by a human perp or an animal, the intent—the will to physically inflict harm—is the same. If anything, animals attack humans inadvertently <em>out of self-defense</em> (believing a human wants to attack their owner or younglings), whereas human criminals know full well what they are doing. Why should the law allow defense against a confused animal but disallow defense against a thug with pre-meditated motives?</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hajdu deflects from these gaping holes in the current legislation by suggesting “we [Trudeau’s Liberals] are developing a<strong> federal gender-based violence</strong> <strong>strategy</strong> in consultation with provinces, territories and grassroots organizations to ensure that women in Canada can live free from violence.” (bold added) Basically, Hajdu hijacks Leitch’s gender-equal position and skews it to gender-specific, proving the Prime Minister and his Liberals are not really about equal treatment of the sexes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The insane implication of Hajdu’s above rebuttal is this: <i>no, Ms. Leitch, self-defense is </i></span><span class="s3"><i>exclusively</i></span><span class="s1"><i> a woman’s issue. But we don’t need self-defense anyway; let loving government intervene and defend the right of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">half</span> the country’s population (women)–the right not to protect themselves, of course, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>to be victims–with legislation aimed at punishing the lesser, brutish half (men) who wish to harm them. </i></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Feeling the equality?</span></p>
