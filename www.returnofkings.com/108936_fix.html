<p><em>This is the second installment of a multi-part series. You can read the first one <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/106160/how-the-manosphere-saved-the-republican-party-and-america">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>To be a successful politician, a person needs to be charismatic, authentic, and articulate speaker. Trump had two out of three. Clinton only had articulation. Thus to win the game for Trump, we needed to articulate for him over the internet why his policies were actually best for America. Most of that time was spent dismantling accusations of racism, sexism, and other attacks against his character. There was very little in terms of policy, because our opponents lost on policy. But sometimes we needed to chime in on that as well. The only reason the manosphere could cover for Trump was due to how much smaller the primary voter turnout is.</p>
<p>On Return Of Kings, by the time you saw an article here, its thoughts were already going viral. Of course we were happy to spread it along. For example, we promoted Vox Day’s <em><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75188/how-conservatives-betrayed-america">How Conservatives Betrayed America</a></em>, we <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/76454/what-is-the-alternative-right">promoted the alt-right</a>, we <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/76529/a-few-predictions-for-western-society-in-2016">gave words of nationalist encouragement</a>, but most importantly were the thousands of articles written over the past four years (<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/archives">4,090 to be exact</a>) alerting American men to the decline of our culture and women. More than anything, it was the preparation to the 2016 election which allowed a bold man like Trump to be accepted in the first place.</p>
<h4>Only the strongest arguments survive</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://s15-us2.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http:%2F%2Fmedia.carbonated.tv%2F127020_story__SPOTLIGHT.jpg&amp;sp=8da8addecae6dd89f03c0eb64794850d" alt="" width="550" height="353"></p>
<p>A particularly great example of the power of my own efforts, was when, during the primaries, Trump’s opponents were slamming him for being against free-trade. Using my knowledge of economics and politics, I created a thread on March 4th, “<a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-54249.html" target="_blank">Why Free-Trade Cannot Co-Exist With Currency Manipulators</a>,” and quickly watched how all discussion on the subject moved to Trump’s favor in the internet public discourse. I would copy and paste the arguments I wrote there in many other conservative forums and threads.</p>
<p>About one month afterwards, I noticed the voices within the <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/08/18/5-issues-and-the-2016-campaign/">Republican party defending free-trade disappeared</a>. Within a few months of the posting of that thread, as Trump described how current trade policies “are a one way street,” people in the audience nodded their heads. It certainly felt like the arguments in that thread got echoed to where they needed to be.</p>
<p>Another example, although much harder to prove, was Lizard of Oz’s thread “<a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-55648.html" target="_blank">Trump General Election Policy Proposals Part 2: Reviving the American Family</a>,” where to the best of my knowledge was the first place anyone coined the meme “#TrumpBabyBoom”! He wrote that thread in May 7th, and on July 20th Ivanka read her proposal to help working class moms with tax deductions and other childcare incentives.</p>
<p>Because the time differential between the thread and Ivanka’s speech is only a month, it is harder to prove that Lizard of Oz was the inspiration for her speech, and it does seem likely that Ivanka was thinking of those ideas for quite some time on her own. But the #TrumpBabyBoom tag was first posted there, and it is totally possible the ideas in his thread echoed through enough people to reach someone in the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>It was a snowball of ideas. And the ball started here and many other places. The internet, with total free speech, means that only the strongest arguments survive. And on this corner of the internet, with a large collection of intelligent men, and, very importantly, no women to distract us, we developed the arguments that would win the day and win the primaries. <a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-48360-post-1047392.html#pid1047392" target="_blank">Special credit goes to Deepdiver</a> as the first pebble that started the avalanche; I recognized the truth of the salty ol’ SeaDog’s arguments and moved to defend and articulate them to the rest of this forum and I watched our arguments spread like wildfire through the internet. We won the internet for Trump.</p>
<h4>Measuring results</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://s14-eu5.ixquick.com/cgi-bin/serveimage?url=http:%2F%2Fwww.activist.co.za%2Fag3nt%2Fmedia%2Fset_001001%2F906-405-910.jpg&amp;sp=fc65ca774b4a9eb6a94a44bd10e4fa84" alt="" width="240" height="320"></p>
<p>Not only was RVF instrumental as a think-tank for Northeast Conservatives, but I’d also like to give credit to <a href="https://mpcdot.com/forums/">Mypostingcareer</a> for Conservatives in the South. Although that forum is rather distasteful with its explicit racism, it doesn’t change the fact that they are influential within Southern conservative circles. Whether we like it or not, racism is the norm in much of the Midwest and South. Blacks and Whites do not get along due to an extremely ugly history, and the grudge has continued for over two centuries.</p>
<p>Democrats have been using this grudge as a political strategy to win votes from Blacks with no care about feelings of love or peace. Racial harmony is bad for the Democrats, and, again, whether we like it or not, the racist Whites of the South and Midwest are our rivals and deserve respect. They still honor ideas of Rule of Law and Christian Neighborly love, but they have trouble accepting Blacks as Neighbors. And likewise Blacks have trouble accepting Whites as neighbors. Up in the Northeast, we notice that Talmudic Jews have trouble accepting Whites as Neighbors. But we’ll discuss more about this when talking about the future of the Republican party in future installments.</p>
<p>The thought-effects of these two forums is obvious when examining how the primary season went; Trump had trouble in the Midwest, but crushed the Southeast and Northeast. The Midwest’s Conservative base mostly watched TV instead of the internet, and the apparent purity of a guy like Ted Cruz was most superficially appealing to them. Things like multi-million dollar loans from Goldman Sachs went unnoticed. Fortunately the Midwest became red pilled by the time the general election rolled around and they were forced to pay attention to Trump.</p>
<p>Thus, during the primary season the forum had heavy influence on how well-informed voters on the internet made their decisions, but it sure didn’t hurt that Trump was an easy sell either! There can be no more doubt about the power of the internet with free speech. It allows men with virtually no social standing or money to shape the thoughts of others. Previously it was said, “the pen is mightier than the sword,” but now we can confidently state that the keyboard is mightier than all the world’s armies and trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>After seeing just how much of a role we played going into the primaries, we can now be more proactive, and confident, in creating cultural and political changes through our internet influence for future national elections. Local elections are much harder to influence in this way, but perhaps we can get there eventually as well.</p>
