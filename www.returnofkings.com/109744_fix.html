<p>Winning—whether it’s at your job, with girls or in your social life—requires you to be at the top of your game constantly. Taking care of your health through exercise and eating right is a big part of that game, but in order to come out on top, you need an edge. Nootropics can provide that edge. By enhancing certain aspects of your brain’s function, nootropics can improve your productivity, help you work smarter instead of harder, and improve your social life.</p>
<p>Nootropics are known as “smart drugs”: over-the-counter substances that give you temporary boosts in memory, focus, sensation and other aspects of your brain function. They can also reduce anxiety, nervousness and other negative mental states, making it easier for you to navigate social functions. Here are some of the ways that nootropics can help you…</p>
<h3>1. Reduce Social Anxiety</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-34987" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/good-thing-about-approach-anxiety.jpg" alt="The good thing about approach anxiety" width="480" height="350"></p>
<p>It’s only natural to feel anxious when you’re on a first date with a girl, giving a business presentation to your colleagues, or some other social function that requires you to be charismatic and controlled. However, letting your anxiety rule you could result in you flubbing whatever you’ve set out to do. Nootropics such as l-theanine and phenibut will lessen your natural anxiety.</p>
<p>L-theanine (as well as suntheanine, a more powerful variant) acts as a natural relaxant, lowering the effects of stress and anxiety on your body without causing drowsiness. It’s particularly effective when paired with a cup of coffee, as it will reduce (and many times eliminate) the jitters or nervousness that come from consuming caffeine. L-theanine is also safe enough to take every day, and some studies show that doing so can lower your blood pressure. <a href="http://www.getlimitlessbrain.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><span class="m_-6709970725379263173gmail-s2"><b>LIMITLESS BRAIN contains 100MG of L-Theanine per serving.</b></span></a></p>
<h3>2. Increase Memory</h3>
<p>Many nootropics are geared towards increasing both your short-term and long-term memory, allowing you to absorb new information more quickly and recall it at a faster speed. Even if you are young, a stronger memory is beneficial as it will increase your productivity and let you learn new facts and skills more efficiently. Nootropics such as noopept and huperzine are designed for the purpose of increasing your memory. <a href="http://www.getlimitlessbrain.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><span class="m_-6709970725379263173gmail-s2"><b>LIMITLESS BRAIN is a powerful nootropic formula that has many benefits including enhanced memory.</b></span></a></p>
<p>Huperzine, an ingredient in LIMITLESS BRAIN, works by increasing the amount of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter, in your brain, giving you sharper senses and a more efficient memory. Indeed, huperzine has been used by Alzheimer’s sufferers to improve their cognitive function. As a side effect, if taken before bed, huperzine makes dreams more vivid and memorable, making it an ideal tool for those interested in lucid dreaming. Because the body develops a tolerance for them quickly, both noopept and huperzine should only be used when needed, though they are not chemically addictive. <a href="http://www.getlimitlessbrain.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><span class="m_-6709970725379263173gmail-s2"><b>LIMITLESS BRAIN mixes Huperzine with 7 other all natural nootropic compounds to produce a powerful product to boost your day to day life. </b></span></a></p>
<h3>3. Improve Focus</h3>

<p>Nootropics can also enhance your ability to focus, a lifesaver when it comes to mundane or repetitive tasks. By allowing you to better concentrate, nootropics can reduce your procrastination and make you more productive. Sulbutiamine and l-tyrosine are two common nootropics for this very purpose.</p>

<p>Sulbutiamine, <a href="http://www.getlimitlessbrain.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><span class="m_-6709970725379263173gmail-s2"><b>another ingredient in LIMITLESS BRAIN</b></span></a>, is a nootropic that reduces fatigue and improves mood. It doesn’t give you a spike of energy like caffeine or other stimulants, but it allows you to stay alert for a longer period of time over the day and avoid getting physically exhausted for longer. Sulbutiamine needs to be taken over several days or a couple of weeks in order to see its effectiveness.</p>
<p>L-tyrosine is an amino acid often used by bodybuilders because it increases noradrenaline in the bloodstream, but it also has nootropic benefits. L-tyrosine can improve your focus, mood and energy by keeping your body’s supply of noradrenaline from becoming depleted, and it also doesn’t affect sleep. We make it easy to stack L-tyrosine by <a href="http://www.getlimitlessbrain.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><span class="m_-6709970725379263173gmail-s2"><b>including it in the LIMITLESS BRAIN formula.</b></span></a></p>

<p class="m_-6709970725379263173gmail-p2">Upon first discovering them, most users are overwhelmed by how many different types of nootropics ingredients exist out there. The reality is that some nootropic ingredients are excellent and others are just mediocre.</p>
