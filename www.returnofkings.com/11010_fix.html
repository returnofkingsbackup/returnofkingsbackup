<p>We all have our ups and downs. Some days you feel on top of the world, you ooze a sexy masculine confidence that women love whereas other days you couldn’t be bothered to shave — you scowl at the thought of doing anything interesting and avoid all outside contact. Many guys accept this with a “que sera, sera” mentality. They feel it is just the natural ebb and flow of things, that taming your emotional state would be too chaotic of a task.</p>
<p>Those who do wish to change usually use hokey terminology talking about “energy” and the “universe.” They’ll seek guidance from another source so that they do not have to take responsibility for letting their emotions get out of check. People also seek a quick cure for a continual state of happiness, but what they do not realize is that happiness is transient.</p>
<p>I do believe there is a way to wrangle your emotions that relies on you, your habits and the power you have to respond to various stimuli. Essentially you must minimize the negativity and maximize the positivity in your life by altering certain habits.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/take-a-step-back.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11023" alt="take a step back" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/take-a-step-back.jpg" width="500" height="352"></a></p>
<h4>Minimize Habits That Lead To Negativity</h4>
<p>Take a moment to think about any time you’ve lost control of your emotions. When did you last get angry, depressed, hateful, etc.? What do you do when you’re out talking to girls that hurts your success? Do you have unreasonable limiting beliefs? Do you believe you always need to be happy to be successful? Do you get frustrated when you have anxiety because of any of the above?</p>
<p>If you think about the above long enough and are mindful when such emotional states occur you will begin to notice a trend in what triggers them.</p>
<p>For me the biggest habits that lead to a negative state of mind, in which I lacked motivation, was depressed, and stayed inside all day, were my nutritional habits. I started to recognize a pattern: I’d go out drinking or eat highly processed foods, I’d wake up the next day tired and dehydrated, then I’d stay inside all day watching movies because I didn’t want to go to the gym or talk to people. The cycle would just endlessly repeat until the natural ebb and flow of things took me to a high point.</p>

<h4>Maximize Habits That Lead To Positivity</h4>
<p>Repeat the exercise above. When was the last time you felt on top of the world, when did you last feel invincible, when did you last have no anxieties? When were you on fire when talking to girls, what were you doing that made you so successful? What were the thoughts running through your head?</p>
<p>Again if you pay attention you will begin to see patterns. You’ll start to realize what habits lead to a great mood.</p>
<p>For me I felt the best when ‘rewarded’ with something. Whether it was having great sex, sharing something with a friend, new PRs in the gym, busting my ass in the library and getting a good grade, or learning a new skill.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/positivity.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11025" alt="positivity" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/positivity.jpg" width="487" height="371"></a></p>
<h4>The Keystone Habit</h4>
<p>Roosh brought up keystone habits in a recent article titled “<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/one-approach-a-day">One Approach A Day</a>.” Essentially it is an innocuous habit that has a much larger effect than planned.</p>
<p>For me I started a few keystone habits: I started the day off with a nice cold glass of lemon water and my vitamins. In doing this I started drinking more and more water leading me to be less dehydrated, more energetic and making better food choices.</p>
<p>I also made a rule that as soon as I start talking myself out of something reasonable I would force myself to do whatever it was I was trying to rationalize my way out of. Maybe I’d start thinking “I’m kind of sore and I still haven’t seen the new episode of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, I think I’ll go to the gym later.” I know I wouldn’t go to the gym later so I would immediately get up and put on my workout gear. Just by doing this I started getting in the mood for lifting — I’ve also heard of guys packing a gym bag every night and leaving it in their car.</p>
<p>The peaks and troughs of our emotional state should not define us. As a man, whether it be through eliminating negative triggers or forming positive habits, you should be fully in control of your emotions. Use the power of a keystone habit to enact much larger scale change so you can be in a perpetual state of positivity, or at the very least, neutrality.</p>
