<p>As we approach the end of the year, we will all be subjected to lame retrospectives filled with trivia that nobody cares about. But 2016 is a significant year because it marked the first time in a very long time that traditional masculinity stopped surrendering and actually mounted an offensive. Here are some of the highlights of the year.</p>
<h3>We made special snowflakes cry</h3>

<p>The best part of 2016 was obviously Donald Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton. This was great for the obvious reason that Hillary’s policies would have dealt the United States a mortal blow, but it had the wonderful side benefit of making her supporters—all of them special snowflakes—cry.</p>

<p>If you are like me, you were probably raised to be a “nice guy.” A person who believes that he should never make anyone cry. The problem with being nice guys is that we allowed the SJWs to walk all over us and turn our culture in a prison where entertaining the wrong idea can get you fired from your job. Therefore, don’t feel bad that you made the SJWs cry.</p>
<h3>Terror</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-110649" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large-300x149.jpeg" alt="c0h_bwaviaeh4k2-jpg-large" width="400" height="198" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large-300x149.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large-768x382.jpeg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large-837x416.jpeg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large-667x331.jpeg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large-262x130.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large-574x285.jpeg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/C0H_bwAVIAEh4k2.jpg-large.jpeg 958w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>2016 will also go down as the year that people started to wake up to the fact that candlelight vigils, holding hands, and hash tags on social media will not make Islamic terrorism go away. If you recall, after Bataclan attack in Paris in November 2015 where 137 were murdered, the response was still to sing kumbaya. But already, when the San Bernadino terrorists slaughtered their co-workers for no reason other than that they were not Muslim, some Americans began to wake up and ask the hard question: Why do so many Muslims hate us? Could it be that Presidents Bush and Obama lied to us when they said Islam is a religion of peace?</p>
<p>The slaughter continued and increased in 2016. In June a Muslim killed 49 in the Pulse nightclub. In July, a Muslim terrorist drove a truck through a crowd of families that had gathered together to watch fireworks. He killed 86 including many children. More recently, a Somali refugee who was getting a free ride to starting a new life in the US (how many of your children will get these kind of benefits?) re-paid the generosity of Americans by trying to run over their sons and daughters at Ohio State. As I write this, the two terror attacks that are in the news are the assassination of the Russian ambassador in Turkey and the murder of 12 when a Muslim terrorist drove a truck through a traditional German Christmas market in Berlin. By the time you read this, there may be more.</p>

<p>With the latest attacks, I’ve seen almost none of maudlin gestures that characterize the Western response to Islamic terror. Even some liberal voices are starting to notice that there may be a problem with Islamic immigration. When we look back, 2016 will mark the year that it finally started to dawn on people that Islam is incompatible with Western civilization.</p>
<h3>The Alt Right went public</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-110650 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CxfZx2cUcAAz9aS.jpg" alt="cxfzx2cucaaz9as" width="329" height="357" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CxfZx2cUcAAz9aS.jpg 329w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CxfZx2cUcAAz9aS-300x326.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CxfZx2cUcAAz9aS-262x284.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px"></p>
<p>When Hillary Clinton delivered her infamous Alt Right speech, it was supposed to paint Trump as an extremist. She obviously failed to achieve that objective. What she did instead is give a national platform to the Alt Right and Pepe the Frog. Suddenly, thousands of people who had never heard about the Alt Right started researching it, including journalists, who in turn wrote more articles about it. Rather than stopping the Alt Right, Hillary’s speech made it national headlines.</p>
<p>The celebrity of the Alt Right continued when <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/i-do-not-disavow-richard-spencer">Richard Spencer</a>, the man credited with coining the term, was banned from Twitter as part of an attempt to silence pro-Trump voices. The ban was unfair because Spencer never attacked other people or espoused violence. Even enemies of Spencer were forced to admit that the ban was a stupid move, and he was later reinstated.</p>
<p>In November the Washington Post ran a hit piece on Spencer and the Alt Right that was supposed to brand the Alt Right as white supremacists and neo-nazi’s (they are neither). Again the article had the opposite effect. It only furthered the spread of Spencer’s message. You can expect to hear a lot more about the Alt Right in 2017.</p>
<h3>Keep the momentum going</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-110651" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/0b9fa793ab9699386962aa9d83d41552-300x187.jpg" alt="0b9fa793ab9699386962aa9d83d41552" width="500" height="312" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/0b9fa793ab9699386962aa9d83d41552-300x187.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/0b9fa793ab9699386962aa9d83d41552-262x164.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/0b9fa793ab9699386962aa9d83d41552-574x359.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/12/0b9fa793ab9699386962aa9d83d41552.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>2016 was a great year for masculinity and nationalism, but we can’t rest on our laurels. The only way to solidify our gains is to keep advancing. Here are some ways we can keep the momentum going into 2017 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Lift weights.</strong> I have to be honest. My wife and I had a baby at the end of 2015 and I got really busy with work. Between work, family, and writing, I had very little time to do anything else. Sometimes had to give and I let working out fall by the wayside. That’s a mistake. Being in good physical condition affects every aspect of your life in a positive way. If you are not already lifting, this is a good time to commit to it. If you are looking for a good routine, you may wish to check out the Stronglifts 5×5 program. But consistency is more important than your workout routine.</p>
<p><strong>Come out of the shitlord closet.</strong> One of the reasons we got into this predicament in the first place is because men began to be silent out of fear of offending people. SJWs have turned our natural aversion to hurting someone’s feelings into a cudgel that they use to keep us in line. But it doesn’t have to be that way. SJWs only have power because decent people let them have power. SJWs view every issue as a wedge issue. If you give them an inch, they will use that inch as a beachhead for launching the next attack on you. And they are relentless. They will never stop until they’ve destroyed you, your nation, and your civilization.</p>
<p>Coming out of the closet can be done in little ways. When the cashier wishes you, “Happy Holidays” you can wish her a “Merry Christmas” back without making a big show of it. When a man is being attacked for his political views or simply because he is a man, come to his defense on social media even if you don’t agree with all of his views. Speak plainly. Don’t compromise with the SJW agenda on any point.</p>
<p><strong>Unplug from entertainment and sports.</strong> The entertainment and sports industries are owned, for the most part, by people who have a leftist agenda. By watching their product, you giving your hard earned money to people who hate you and who will use that money to undermine you. It might be too draconian to stop watching all entertainment and sports, although many men have done that. A more reasonable idea for the coming year is to severely restrict time spent on corporate entertainment. Spend the time and money you save on achieving a goal that is going to make your life better in the future.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>This Christmas, kick back and celebrate the feast with gladness. It has been a tough year but traditional men have risen to the challenge. We deserve to savor the victory. Get rested because in 2017 we once again become part of the vanguard to bring back the patriarchy.</p>
