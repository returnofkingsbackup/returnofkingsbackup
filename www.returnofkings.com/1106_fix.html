<p>No one around here is <em>for</em> hitting or brutalizing women, but there’s an enduring myth—that persists right up to the present—that you should <em>never</em> hit a woman. <em>No matter what.</em> As you can see from this PSA, this notion goes right up to the top: the President and Vice-President of the United States are saying it to your face. This isn’t a Democrat-Republican issue. This isn’t an Obama issue. This is a Western phenomenon, that long predates—and will long out-survive—this administration.</p>
<p>The problem is that this whole idea is predicated on several problematic assumptions. Among them are that:</p>
<p>1. Women never hit anyone, including men.</p>
<p>2. Hitting women is somehow worse than any other forms of unilateral violence (e.g., women hitting men, men hitting weaker men, or adults hitting children).</p>
<p>3. Women never provoke men, with inflammatory actions that—while not violence <em>per se</em>—are designed to elicit a reaction, humiliate them, or destroy their possessions (e.g., smash their car).</p>
<p>4. Hitting a woman immediately renders all of the prior circumstances irrelevant.</p>
<p>5. <em>Mutual</em> fights between women and men are impossible.</p>
<p>Real “domestic violence” (what I’d broadly define as uneven, unilateral forms of violence—bullying, essentially—between people in certain types of relationships) is a serious matter—one that should be legislated and punished. But, when you create an <em>across-the-board</em>, over-simplified rule that you should “never hit a <em>woman</em>,” you basically reduce domestic violence to only unprovoked, male-to-female violence. Plus, it feeds an existing culture that grants women virtual <em>carte blanche</em> to act however they want—including hitting men—with little fear of serious legal, physical, or social consequences.</p>

<p>If she hits him, <em>he</em> must have done something wrong. If he hits her back, <em>he’s</em> abusive. In this calculus, men always turn out in the wrong. Meanwhile, a man will receive all three consequences—in spades—if he merely responds with the same exact level of violence. He’ll likely get his-ass stomped by white knights. The cops will arrest him. And, people who learn of “his actions” will shame him.</p>
<p>Despite the countless problems with this appalling state of affairs, I’d say a majority of men, in my social circle at least, know how to handle a situation when a woman becomes violent at a bar, at home, or on the street–pushing him, getting in his face, punching him, or dumping a drink on him. They walk away, tell the bouncer, or restrain the woman until she calms down. He’s expected to–and <em>must</em>–display the patience, restraint, and physical resilience of a saint.</p>
<p>But more importantly, what kind of women do you create <em>as a society</em> when you take the now-anachronistic notion (thanks to feminism) that women are in need of special protection to its logical extreme, selectively keeping <em>that</em> in place while removing other so-called out-dated notions of gender?</p>
