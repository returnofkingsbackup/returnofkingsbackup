<p>Not long ago, I was with a small, private gathering for one of my social circles. It’s a predominantly left-leaning crowd. The conversation turned to some of the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95854/how-to-fight-politically-correct-language" target="_blank">new goofy pronouns</a> now in vogue, and what the term “cisgendered” meant. When I declared myself to be a unicorn, it got a few chuckles.</p>
<p>Then one of them said that his daughter identified as “non-binary gender” and preferred the pronoun “it.” I had nothing more to say; <em>that completely floored me</em>. They started discussing how trendy all that was, and everyone thought it was wonderful that kids were experimenting with gender identities. From the way they described it, the kids were doing so like they try out new clothing fashions.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell them that <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/86615/the-end-game-of-feminism-and-cultural-marxism-is-to-eliminate-sex-differences" target="_blank">cultural Marxism</a> is ruining our youth. Doing so would’ve gotten a worse reaction than being the proverbial grouchy uncle who talks politics at the Thanksgiving dinner table. Actually, I wanted to shout about it, but I would have been as welcome as an atheist in a monastery. This brief glimpse into the lives of today’s youth was one of those moments where it seemed like I was living in a science fiction story where I had woken up in some strange dystopia.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how old his girl is, or when this idea first surfaced, but I’d bet a paycheck that “it” didn’t come up with that herself. I’m quite sure these kids were just exploring a new fad, but that didn’t make me feel any better about it. Since transsexuality is a very rare psychological condition affecting <a href="http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Gates-How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf" target="_blank">three tenths of one percent</a> of adults, how did this neurosis become so trendy with young people today?</p>
<h4>Kids don’t get these ideas on their own</h4>

<p>Back when I went to school, I never heard of anyone wanting to be called by “it,” or anything but the correct pronoun for their physical sex. There simply weren’t any boys who thought they were girls, or vice versa. I never heard of anything like that in the very large and ultra-liberal college I attended either.</p>
<p>Were there some who were just too shy to “come out” about it? I find that doubtful. I knew of some gay students, but never anyone who didn’t know what sex he or she belonged to. Not once did I hear the slightest rumor of anything like that, not even as a random insult, even in the junior high where the word “faggot” was thrown around as often as peas and mashed potatoes in a food fight.</p>
<p>When it comes to sexual identity, screwing with a child’s mind is criminally irresponsible. An observant young person can <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/91811/16-year-old-girl-portrays-post-millennials-as-a-hopeless-generation" target="_blank">see this happening</a> to peers.</p>
<h4>Propaganda in schools</h4>
<div id="attachment_86171" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-86171" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson-300x194.jpg" alt="GenderbreadPerson" width="500" height="323" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson-300x194.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson-768x497.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson-837x541.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson-667x431.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson-262x169.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson-574x371.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GenderbreadPerson.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">An actual handout in some schools</p>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://baptistnews.com/article/speaker-says-genderbread-person-highlights-need-for-christian-schools/#.WGsuh03FC70" target="_blank">educational system</a> is much to blame for trying to “deconstruct the gender binary.” The GLBT agenda is generally sold as an effort to reduce bullying. I understand that picking on people for being different is a dick move. In a perfect world—which this isn’t—children wouldn’t get hassled about things like freckles, wearing glasses, being short, or having an unusual name. Of course, essential characteristics like those are not really given much emphasis, since they’re not on the list of politically correct priorities.</p>
<p>If the concern really was only about bullying, then all teachers have to do is explain that picking on people who are different (for whatever reason) is bad. Then they should apply it consistently. Instead, they are going much further by evangelizing “alternative lifestyles.” (Don’t count on them describing the politically incorrect facts about what groups you’re more likely to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats15/toc.htm" target="_blank">catch an STD from</a>, of course.) As it happens, this propaganda doesn’t occur only in <a href="http://www.rescueyourchild.com/The_Problem.html" target="_blank">places like California</a>.</p>
<p>Does the GLBT crowd favor pushing this sort of thing in schools? Consider the provocatively-titled article “<a href="https://www.queerty.com/can-we-please-just-start-admitting-that-we-do-actually-want-to-indoctrinate-kids-20110512" target="_blank">Can We Please Just Start Admitting That We <em>Do</em> Actually Want To Indoctrinate Kids?</a>“:</p>
<blockquote><p>They accuse us of exploiting children and in response we say, “NOOO! We’re not gonna make kids learn about homosexuality, we swear! It’s not like we’re trying to recruit your children or anything.” But let’s face it—that’s a lie. We want educators to teach future generations of children to accept queer sexuality. In fact, our very future depends on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>With greater chutzpah:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I would very much like for many of these young boys to grow up and start fucking men. I want lots of young ladies to develop into young women who voraciously munch box. I want this just as badly as many parents want their own kids to grow up and rub urinary tracts together to trade proteins and forcefully excrete a baby.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll give the author credit for being honest, but schools are certainly not the kind of place to preach this sort of thing to a captive audience.</p>
<p>In the five years since that interesting piece was written, the spotlight has turned toward the transsexual (and related) parts of the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/88795/youre-homophobic-if-you-dont-accept-the-new-gay-abbreviation" target="_blank">LGBTTQQIAA dealio</a>. They got everything they wanted with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/86729/when-everyone-has-to-accept-gay-marriage-its-not-tolerance-but-tyranny" target="_blank">gay marriage</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/89939/pentagon-to-allow-transvestites-to-serve-in-us-military-will-pay-for-sex-change-surgery" target="_blank">gays in the military</a>. So now the focus shifted to <a href="https://www.zerocensorship.com/uncensored/virginia/parents-upset-at-school-boards-protections-for-transgender-students-277248" target="_blank">tranny stuff</a>, the latest in the unending quest of cultural Marxism to socially engineer the world their way.</p>
<p>Parents aren’t consulted about whether or not they want their kids to be indoctrinated. Most would agree with me about all this. The problem is, the parents aren’t calling the shots.</p>

</div>
<p>A few years ago, you hardly ever heard about anything like this. After <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62598/is-bruce-jenner-having-a-sex-change-because-females-get-more-attention" target="_blank">Bruce Jenner</a> “became a woman,” this stuff started appearing everywhere in the media.</p>
<p>“She” even was named <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/25/women-cry-foul-glamour-magazine-names-bruce-jenner-woman-year/" target="_blank">Woman of the Year</a> by <em>Glamour.</em> That was kind of a slap in the face to over three three billion people on the planet who <em>actually are women</em>. Even <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/93777/hillary-and-bill-clinton-are-criminal-masterminds-wielding-incredible-power" target="_blank">Hillary</a> (bless her heart) would’ve been a better pick, since she biologically qualifies for the distinction. The point, of course, was to try to convince the public that a guy who puts on a dress and calls himself a woman really is one. Why do fashion magazines have to make political statements anyway?</p>
<p>Now this sort of thing is all over the media. They propagandize this with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/102546/how-mainstream-tv-uses-emotional-triggers-to-sway-political-opinion" target="_blank">heartstring-pulling dramas</a>. Worse, this stuff is being pushed even on <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3885922/Parents-slam-damaging-BBC-sex-change-aimed-six-year-olds.html" target="_blank">shows for little kids</a> too. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/70516/3-reasons-why-you-should-never-let-your-child-watch-sesame-street" target="_blank"><em>Sesame Street</em></a>—a show for preschoolers which receives Federal funding—got into the act as well. Even <em><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/110604/why-we-must-boycott-national-geographic-until-they-are-bled-dry" target="_blank">National Geographic</a></em> has jumped on the bandwagon. Kids shouldn’t be exposed to this degenerate stuff, let alone encouraged in it.</p>
<h4>Why this is wrong</h4>
<p>First of all, a man who thinks he’s a woman isn’t really a woman, even if he takes hormones and gets extensive cosmetic surgery. He’s just a confused guy making a spectacle out of himself. Being out of touch with reality is a neurosis. It doesn’t always end there; one of these guys <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3524063/Transgender-woman-Eva-Tiamat-Medusa-ears-nose-removed-dragon-lady.html" target="_blank">thinks “she” is a dragon</a> <em>(warning: you can’t un-see those pictures)</em>. Actually, quite a few Social Justice Warriors believe they’re <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95868/the-delusional-reality-of-social-justice-warriors-is-a-form-of-mental-illness" target="_blank">not even human</a>. (For that matter, some people think they have <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/12/a-new-way-to-be-mad/304671/" target="_blank">too many limbs</a> too.) Adults playing make-believe are neurotic, and they have no business dictating public policy to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>What will happen to the kids who are influenced by transsexual propaganda? Likely most of them will grow out of it. Unfortunately, some are being encouraged in this <a href="http://moonbattery.com/?p=58001" target="_blank">from a young age</a>. Since the fruitcakes started running the asylum, kids are getting <a href="http://moonbattery.com/?p=46013" target="_blank">artificial hormones</a> that will screw up their development, and some even get <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2009/09/18/boy-12-preparing-to-undergo-sex-change-operation.html" target="_blank">sex change operations</a>. Many will end up regretting all this, which <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2224753/Ria-Cooper-Britains-youngest-sex-change-patient-reverse-treatment.html" target="_blank">already has happened</a>.</p>
<p>Encouraging kids to think they’re something they’re not is child abuse; encouraging them to disfigure their bodies is even more monstrous. I can see why the suicide rate is so high for transsexuals, which is all the more reason not to push this on kids. The activists tell us that this is because society doesn’t accept that. I say it’s because a guy who wants to get his junk cut off already has something wrong between the ears.</p>
<h4>What can be done?</h4>
<div id="attachment_111693" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-111693 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pinochet-helicopter-ride.jpg" alt="pinochet-helicopter-ride" width="300" height="297" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pinochet-helicopter-ride.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pinochet-helicopter-ride-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pinochet-helicopter-ride-262x259.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pinochet-helicopter-ride-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Just kidding!</p>
</div>
<p>For the educational system, devolving power is the solution. Surely this madness is being pushed from the very top. Likely this is by high-level Department of Education munchkins who’ve made their “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/38656/modern-social-justice-warriors-use-the-same-subversion-strategies-as-the-ussr" target="_blank">long march through the institutions</a>” and are letting activist groups write their curricula. If they won’t stop abusing their powers to push this (along with other <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/90815/how-the-cultural-marxists-of-the-frankfurt-school-subverted-education" target="_blank">cultural Marxist</a> propaganda), then they should be thrown out, or their department should be abolished.</p>
<p>If we cut the head off the snake, the activists will have to try to push their agenda in state capitals. They might get their way in the Northeast and the Left Coast, but not in “flyover country.” They’ll have a tougher time getting their apparatchiks in place in all 50 states as well as well as fighting parents in places like Kansas and Utah.</p>
<p>As for the media, that will be more difficult. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/40432/the-3-divisions-of-the-matrix-you-must-unplug-from" target="_blank">Unplug from it</a>, if you haven’t already done so; stop feeding the beast. If enough people write to the producers and their sponsors, letting them know that you don’t care for their propaganda, this might help too.</p>
<p>Until all this happens, responsible parents will have to explain to their sons that they are boys, and their daughters that they are girls. This is how nature made them, and this means something. Warn your children that there are people who want to influence their “lifestyle” (as well as their political views), and to let you know when this happens.</p>
<p>Then, raise hell with school boards. Go to PTA meetings and express your concerns. Many parents are unaware of what’s going on, and others are afraid of getting shouted down. You might even get some criticism, but the future of our youth is worth fighting for.</p>
