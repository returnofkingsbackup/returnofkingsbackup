<p>As of January 1st, 2017, another controversial, prostitution-friendly law took effect within the friendly confines of the liberal State of California. And this largely under-the-radar piece of legislation came on the heels of the widely publicized <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/111556/california-law-sb-1322-greenlights-child-prostitution-criminalizes-being-poor">California SB-1322</a>, which effectively decriminalized prostitution for minors, as well as their willing adult dance partners.</p>
<p>Authored by Senator Bill Monning (D-Carmel), <a href="http://votesmart.org/bill/21560/56659/104370/repeals-minimum-sentences-for-repeat-prostitution-offenses">California SB-1129 </a>repealed mandatory minimum sentences <em>for all prostitution offenses in the entire state</em>, which, for all intense and purposes, totally decriminalized the practice.</p>
<p>This one-two combination of progressive new laws, has opened the flood gates wide for legalized prostitution, not only within the warm-and-fuzzy confines of The Golden State, but across the entire USA as well.</p>
<h4><strong>Nationwide legal prostitution—and the big picture for men</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112131 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Duality.jpg" alt="duality" width="387" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Duality.jpg 387w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Duality-300x258.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Duality-262x225.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px"></p>
<p>And what might this new legislation mean, exactly, in terms of the bigger picture, as it pertains to the manosphere, and feminism, and the overall tilt of the sexual playing field?</p>
<p>Like it or not, this is a dual world – it consists of equal measures of light and darkness, and there isn’t a damn thing that anybody can do that will ever change that fact. So the non-delusional among us (meaning wide-awake, red-pill men, versus delusional beta males and insane feminists), simply have to take the good with the bad here, as we always do, and move forward.</p>
<p>With the advent of those previously mentioned twin California laws, the time is nearly upon us when legal, no-strings, sex-for-cash hookups of the readily abundant variety, will be available to all of us men, in nearly every city and town throughout the entire United States of America.</p>
<p><em>Just imagine it, if you can.</em> No more expensive dinner dates and pre-coitus gifts, prior to getting a chance to bang some hot, vacuous, self-empowered slut. Each of us will soon be able to cut directly to the chase, negotiate the terms, and have our pick of the hottest of the hot, in terms of what our money might ultimately be able to afford us.</p>
<h4><strong>Is legalized prostitution across America really a certainty?</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112132 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fireworks-3.jpg" alt="fireworks-3" width="450" height="334" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fireworks-3.jpg 450w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fireworks-3-300x223.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Fireworks-3-262x194.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p>
<p><em>“But Uncle Bob, how can you be so sure of this?”</em> some of you may wonder. And that’s a really good question, and one that you should rightly ask.</p>
<p>As some of you may realize, your old Uncle Bob has low friends in high places. And I keep my ear to the ground, as a matter of practice. And one of the major goals of those who control the puppet strings of the world, is to legalize prostitution (and sports betting, which is a different kettle of fish, but nonetheless related), across the entire United States of America. So you can indeed make book on it, that prostitution and sports betting will eventually be legal, in virtually every city and town across North America.</p>
<p>President-Elect Donald J. Trump once owned two Atlantic City casinos, which is a major clue right there for those who have eyes to see. And that’s a very convenient coincidence, especially for “leisure business concerns,” now that Donald Trump will soon be in the White House, isn’t it, now?</p>
<p>As another case in point, prostitution is already legal in Canada, minus a few important tweaks on the male side of the judicial equation. And America will be next. Nevada was the testing ground. California was Door Number 2. And soon the rest of the United States will follow suit. And you can take that one to the bank. <em>Business unusual</em>, will soon become <em>business as usual.</em> And the rich will indeed get richer, as is always the case.</p>
<p><em>Again, just imagine it.</em> No more shit-tests before sex; no more putting up with some narcissist’s crap so you can bang her stretched-out man-trap; cash, as always, will still be king, and the race will still be to the swift, but everyone will get laid during the entire duration of the contest. And so, I must ask you right here and right now – <em>will that be a major improvement over the current situation, or what</em>?</p>
<h4><strong>Red-pill men will rise, old school feminists will cower, and hot girls will give it up for money</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112134 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cash-Is-King.jpg" alt="cash-is-king" width="524" height="361" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cash-Is-King.jpg 524w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cash-Is-King-300x207.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cash-Is-King-262x181.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px"></p>
<p>Continuing to look on the bright side here, imagine what this will initially do to the already-tenuous self-esteem of fat, ugly feminazis everywhere. Oh, the moral outrage and righteous indignation that this will engender – “That <em>CREEPER</em> can actually <em>PAY</em> that hot girl to have <em>SEX</em> with him? Oh my <em>GAWD</em>!”</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>And just think of the effect that this will have on beta/omega orbiters, who currently inflate the egos of all of those Instagram-addicted, narcissistic, self-important, Tinder sluts – poof, no more orbiting will be necessary. Beta males will no longer feel the need to buy gifts for hot females, or give them any attention at all. They will be able to scour the Internet ads and online venues of the world, for legal prostitutes who reside in their own towns, and they will actually get sex for their hard-earned cash, instead of a hand-holding session after buying some marginally hot, social-media slut a new car.</p>
<p>Most red-pill males will adjust quickly to this new twist of fate, and immediately see the beauty of it, while mercilessly taking full advantage of the situation. Women already get paid for sex anyway, when you break it all down. <em>Some girls do it for cash – some do it for refrigerators</em>. This will just simplify things.</p>
<h4><strong>Very soon, embracing old school feminism will be the kiss of death for all American women</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112135 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sad-Feminist.jpeg" alt="sad-feminist" width="496" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sad-Feminist.jpeg 496w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sad-Feminist-300x201.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sad-Feminist-262x176.jpeg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"></p>
<p>Survival of the fittest will take center stage once prostitution is legalized across the United States of America. And it will truly be an out-in-the-open fact at that point, that the most desirable women always gets the biggest chunks of cash, and the smartest, strongest, richest men always get the most desirable women. Just as it should be; just as it always will be. And this world-shaking development will stand feminism completely on its ear.</p>
<p>New-wave feminism will, at that juncture, consist of <em>aggressively</em> encouraging women to sell their sexual wares for money, to whomever they might want. And the majority of women, hot or not, having a natural proclivity for taking money in return for sexual favors anyway (see: hypergamy), will make a mad dash in the direction of this new, exciting, already-hardwired-in-their-nature enterprise. And only total sexual rejects will cling to old school feminism at that point – but this won’t last for long.</p>
<p>True, old school feminists will still exist, but their numbers will dwindle as rapidly as those of rats abandoning a sinking ship. They will shriek about sexual exploitation for a while, as hot girls stack up the cash and laugh in their faces, but their indignant cries will fall on deaf ears to the point where eventually, they, too, will shut up and accept the changes of the feminist landscape in silence, while retreating to their ghostly abodes, in order to pet their cats, and dream of Mr. Big, while crying in their Starbucks Espressos.</p>
<h4><strong>Supply and demand will work in our favor after the flood gates – and women’s legs – open wide</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112145 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fashion-beauty-model-portrait.jpg" alt="fashion-beauty-model-portrait" width="450" height="345" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fashion-beauty-model-portrait.jpg 450w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fashion-beauty-model-portrait-300x230.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/fashion-beauty-model-portrait-262x201.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p>
<p>Once prostitution is legalized nationwide, the price for the average woman’s sexual services will be driven down, as supply initially explodes, and demand initially fails to keep pace. Only extremely hot females will be able to command big money right out of the gate, and the rest of them will have to take whatever they can get.</p>
<p>Soon after, the snowball will start rolling downhill fast, to the point where liberal parents everywhere will one day proudly offer unbridled, full-throttle, enthusiastic support to their sexually desirable daughters, who were progressive enough during the <em>real</em> sexual revolution, to buck the “bigoted” system of the past, and embrace the benefits of exacting a reasonable rate of return for allowing any and all comers (pun intended) the chance to sample their enticing sexual wares within the framework of the ultra-liberal, modern-day marketplace – exactly like most of them already do for their LGBT children.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112137 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Alive.jpg" alt="alive" width="450" height="336" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Alive.jpg 450w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Alive-300x224.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Alive-262x196.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p>
<p>The chickens will have finally come home to roost for feminists everywhere, after prostitution has been legalized nationwide. And the cock, as always, will continue to crow. But this time, he will crow as the morning sun rises on a brand-new day – a day that will finally give red-pill men everywhere the overall advantage on the sexual playing field.</p>
<p>Victory truly is within our grasp now. All we have to do is focus on our own betterment in the interim, and be strong and swift in the pursuit of our individual goals, and then, reach out and grab whatever it is that we might want. Because it’s feminism in reverse. Our time has finally arrived. <em>Because the elite created feminism as a means of divide and conquer – and after spending feminism’s formative years screwing men, the elite will very shortly begin to turn the screws on women, who will very eagerly and enthusiastically embrace the screwing</em>.</p>
<p>And a truly unbridled, viscerally sweet triumph for all red-pill men, everywhere, it will indeed be – most especially for men who possess the best overall <em>game</em>; which is, once again, just as things <em>should</em> be.</p>
