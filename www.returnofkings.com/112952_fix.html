<p>Modern men have unwittingly joined a pagan cult. This cult has no buildings and no formal hierarchy yet it is leading men to embrace degeneracy, encouraging girls to become sluts, and furthering the cause of feminism. This cult has no name but it it does have an object of worship: Women on the internet. Here are some of the most common manifestations of this cult.</p>
<h3>Pundithots</h3>

<p>For some reason, men who identify as conservative really flock to any reasonably attractive woman who says conservative things. Conservative women pundits are a cottage industry that doesn’t exist on the left. This could be because men tend to be conservatives and women tend to be liberal. A lot of the success of Fox News can be attributed to Roger Ailes’ formula of having attractive female news anchors showing a bit of leg and reporting the news with a conservative slant.</p>
<p>It goes far beyond just Fox News anchors though. There are tons of conservative female pundits out there: Katherine Timpf, Katie Pavlich, Michelle Malkin, S.E. Cupp, Ann Coulter, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Dana Perino, and Joanne Nosuchinsky. In addition to these women, who regularly appear on TV, there is another group of women, such as Tomi Lahren and Lauren Southern, who develop large followings on social media. The 24-year-old Lahren has half a million Twitter followers.</p>

<p>Political pundits are an unfortunate by-product of democracy, but some of them do provide valuable analysis. The question is whether men are following these women because of their provocative political positions or whether it is just because of beta male thirst. A few of these ladies do indeed advance the political discourse in the country. Ann Coulter is the best example. Her book <a href="http://amzn.to/2iBgiBL"><em>Adios America</em></a> was the first popular treatment of the United States out-of-control immigration problem. It was Coulter’s book that swayed Donald Trump to adopt his now famous hard-line immigration stance.</p>
<p>But while some female pundits are worth their salt, most of the others are just cuckservative eye candy, or pundithots (a portmanteau of “pundit” and “thot”). Take Lauren Southern. The 21-year-old bleach blond has 187,000 followers on Twitter and just released her new 61-page book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2iBlxBa"><em>Barbarians, How Baby-Boomers, Immigrants, and Islam Ruined My Generation</em></a>. Southern is known for espousing mildly Trumpian views and posting cute (not salacious, she’s trying to appeal to “conservatives” after all) photos of herself. Recently, she posted a picture with herself in anime workout pants—a nod to her Alt Right fan base.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112954" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ-300x169.jpg" alt="c1dcelqwiaauusz" width="366" height="206" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ-768x432.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/C1dCelQWIAAUuSZ-574x323.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 366px) 100vw, 366px"></p>
<p>Southern’s political views and reporting are not particularly remarkable—there are dozens of people who offer a similar slant, but Southern is attractive and she consciously uses her looks to gain a greater following. As she writes in her book:</p>
<blockquote><p>If there was a moment in the 2016 U.S. election that epitomized this newfound hate for the young on the right, it was Republican consultant Rick Wilson’s infamous… declaration that Trump supporters were “childless, single losers who masturbate to anime.” Guilty as charged. Well, except I don’t masturbate to anime characters. I dress up like them <em>and guys masturbate to me</em>. (Emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this sound like Southern respects her readers/followers? Here are some of their comments to a recent picture she posted:</p>

<p>Another problem with the pundithots is that the media elite use them to control the narrative of what is acceptable discourse. The 28-year-old Katie Pavlich was afforded a slot on <em>National Review</em>‘s “Against Trump” issue even though she doesn’t have a track record for providing leading edge Republican policy recommendations. Rather, it is a way to set the boundaries for conservative men. After all, you would not want the attractive Katie Pavlich to think you are a racist because you want to deport illegal Central American immigrants, right?</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. I am not opposed to all female political pundits. Ann Coulter did more to shift the Overton Window on immigration in the past two years than all male pundits put together. But don’t lavish attention on female pundits that push a cuckservative agenda merely because they are cute. Instead, support political outlets that are truly pushing the edge in political thought. I recommend checking out <a href="http://takimag.com/">Taki’s Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net">Social Matter</a>, and Matt Forney’s new home <a href="https://www.righton.net">Right On</a>.</p>
<h3>Instagram Girls</h3>
<p>Pundithots at least try to provide a value-add to their eye-candy pics by providing some banal political commentary. Instagram girls don’t even bother to do that. They post photos of themselves in varying stages of undress on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to get comments from strangers on the internet. Many of these women are more nefarious. They are selling porn or access to their web cam service or they are just <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/57571/tag-the-sponsor-exposes-the-depravity-of-modern-women">wannabe prostitutes who secretly hope that wealthy Arabs will fly them to Dubai to service their friends</a>.  Whatever the case is, you don’t want to encourage their behavior.</p>
<p>Even if the girl is not a prostitute yet, traditional men should not encourage girls to expose themselves on the internet. If you want a traditional society, you should reward chaste women who dress modestly. If you reward the internet tart, you are encouraging more of the same behavior.</p>
<h3>Women on your social media</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112979 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/duckface-girls-19.jpg" alt="duckface-girls-19" width="500" height="370" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/duckface-girls-19.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/duckface-girls-19-300x222.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/duckface-girls-19-262x194.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Anyone who has used social media knows the temptation. A woman you know posts a picture of herself on social media. The purpose of the picture is out there for one reason: To get compliments through “likes” or comments. How many times have you been tempted to “like” a picture just to be nice?</p>
<p>This is actually the least offensive method of worshipping a woman on the internet because you actually know the woman. If you are both single, you actually might have a chance of dating her. Still, it is a bad idea. It rewards women who engage in attention-whoring behavior and it still turns you in to a beta orbiter. Better to spend less time socializing on social media and more time doing it in real life.</p>
<h3>Why you shouldn’t worship women—on the internet or anywhere else</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-112965 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/URXdm4wf.jpeg" alt="urxdm4wf" width="400" height="400" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/URXdm4wf.jpeg 400w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/URXdm4wf-150x150.jpeg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/URXdm4wf-300x300.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/URXdm4wf-262x262.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/01/URXdm4wf-45x45.jpeg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>You might be thinking: “What’s the harm in showing appreciation to attractive women on the internet?” It’s wrong because it is inherently beta male behavior. One of the best places to observe this is in a nightclub. In a club, you will find that an alpha male may be surrounded by two or more attractive women. The women all all vying for his attention in the hope that they can push out their female rivals. Beta males, on the other hand, are more likely to congregate in groups around an attractive girl and her friends. The attractive girl just sucks up the attention of the beta orbiters.</p>
<p>Attention-seeking girls on the internet are doing the exact same thing, except instead of having two or three beta orbiters, a popular internet girl can command the attention of hundreds of thirsty beta males at the same time. Instead of buying a girl a drink, you might end up with an internet girl’s book, product, or porn. It’s even worse though. At least in real life, you stand some chance of advancing on the attractive girl. On the internet, the most you’ll get is a “like” for your sad comment from the object of your infatuation.</p>
<p>In addition to putting you into a beta orbiter mindset, worshipping women on the internet also perpetuates the feminized society. If you are constantly trying to please women on the web, you are not going to openly oppose feminism, female careerism, or the ever increasing degeneracy of society because women are some of biggest supporters of those things. If we are too cowardly to even refrain from sucking up to girls on the web, we won’t be able to improve our own lives, much less bring about a return of the patriarchy. If you want to be a patriarch, act like one. Don’t worship some thot on the internet.</p>
<p>Finally, worshipping women on the internet is a colossal waste of time. You could spend the time you are sending compliments to some internet slag with self-improvement.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We must make defeating the cult of worshipping women on the internet one of our top priorities. While I wish that every man would give up this embarrassing behavior on his own, some are going to need our help. Remember, friends don’t let friends worship internet thots.</p>
