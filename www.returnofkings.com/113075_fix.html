<p>Mike Enoch, a virulent anti-Semite and proprietor of the popular alt-right podcast <em>The Daily Shoah</em> (via <a href="https://radio.therightstuff.biz/"><em>The Right Stuff </em>web page</a>), has been outed for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/17/right-stuff-alt-right-site-mike-enoch-revealed">having a Jewish wife</a>. We have little interest as to whether Enoch, real name Mike Peinovich, beds a Jewish woman. What concerns us, however, is the rank hypocrisy of <em>The Daily Shoah</em> podcast, where Enoch has lambasted <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62716/the-damaging-effects-of-jewish-intellectualism-and-activism-on-western-culture">Jewish influence in Western society</a> and decried “race-mixing” and the dilution of European races. There is even speculation that Enoch is Jewish himself.</p>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/vEv672uRhLQ%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Over recent months, the mainstream media has used men like Mike Enoch/Peinovich (often without naming them) to portray Trump supporters as unabashed racists who pose an existential threat to American democracy. Forgetting that around 50 million people voted for Trump, SJWs and liberals more broadly falsely claim that Peinovich and others are directly representative of those who put The Donald into office. It was, in fact, <a href="https://aryanskynet.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/all-the-best-nazis-are-jewish/">Peinovich who allegedly initiated a Nazi/Roman salute</a> at last year’s NPI conference while media cameras were running, which caused media outrage <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/i-do-not-disavow-richard-spencer">against Richard Spencer and the alt-right</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Enoch was the one who ran to the front of the stage at the NPI conference and did a “Heil Hitler” for <em>The Atlantic</em>’s cameras, which was then featured in the Jewish media, edited purposefully to make the entire event seem as close to a “Nazi rally” as possible. While Mike Enoch had his identity protected by NPI, <em>The Atlantic</em>, and the Jewish media – other people involved – the ones that did NOT pose in front of the cameras and “Heil Hitler” – were not so lucky, and many have lost their jobs and been slandered by the media for simply attending a conference – a conference that, up until that point, never engaged in anything close to “Nazi LARPing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>While many major media outlets have deliberately and very consciously twisted the narrative to suit their pro-Hillary agenda, the presence of <em>The Right Stuff</em> and other incendiary publications continues to assist lying journalists from coast to coast. The exposure of Mike Peinovich’s cover raises the serious question of whether the creation and ongoing operation of <em>The Right Stuff</em> is really just an elaborate fiction to control and draw in real alt-right supporters. Strangely, his wife appeared in at least <a href="http://www.salon.com/2017/01/16/cat-fight-on-the-alt-right-neo-nazi-podcaster-mike-enoch-quits-after-doxxers-reveal-his-wife-is-jewish/">one of his Holocaust parodies</a> on <em>The Daily Shoah</em>. Why would a Jewish woman do this if the whole project were not an instance of controlled opposition?</p>
<h3>What is Mike Enoch/Peinovich’s motive?</h3>
<p>4Chan users have revealed that Mike Peinovich’s Jewish wife is a strong proponent of LGBT issues and has worked for the Jewish service organization B’nai B’rith. She represents exactly what <em>The Daily Shoah </em>calls “degenerate” and “pozzed” behavior.</p>

<p>You could say that any human being is riddled with inconsistencies, contradictions, and even hypocrisies, but Mike Enoch/Peinovich’s double standard really does take the cake. <em>The Right Stuff</em>, Peinovich, and his supporters were thrilled at the threats to Roosh and his family’s safety in early 2016 after the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/80468/official-timeline-to-the-worldwide-hysteria-over-roks-international-meetup-day">meet-up furor</a>. Here’s one of Peinovich’s top cronies seemingly applauding the outrage but wishing it was for another reason (Roosh banging European girls, most likely):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">

<p>The above associate in particular has attacked Roosh and other writers for sharing the realities of modern dating.</p>

<p>Was his attack against game theory a way to vent against the card he drew in the sexual marketplace? Pictures of his wife that were revealed in his own dox, which we won’t reveal here, do point to that conclusion.</p>
<h3>So what’s wrong with Mike Enoch/Peinovich?</h3>

<p>It is abundantly clear that Mike Enoch/Peinovich, whose podcast created the (((echo))) meme to identify Jews, either has substantial psychological issues or is controlled opposition. If the former is true, we genuinely wish him all the best. Perhaps his wife dominates their relationship and activities like <em>The Daily Shoah</em> were an attempt to contain frustration over her hen-pecking. Or maybe he, despite his own lack of physical conditioning, resents the woman he now finds himself with.</p>
<p>The real problem is that Peinovich’s unhelpful political posturing has scapegoated the rest of us for a very long time. Red pill or pseudo-red pill communities form a very broad church, but consequences for one corner invariably flow to others, assisted by a media very eager to be obsequious towards SJW interests. It does not matter that <em>The Right Stuff</em> hates Roosh for his Middle Eastern background, namely because Peinovich and <em>Return Of Kings</em> are seen by elites as pieces of the same pie. Any revelations of mental illness by Peinovich will not affect this conflation one iota. Moreover, it’s especially hypocritical that Peinovich’s podcast has criticized Roosh and other masculine men for “race-mixing” when he himself mixed with the very Jewish “enemy” his podcast claims is bringing down Western civilization.</p>
<p>The more sinister option, that Mike Peinovich is controlled opposition, is one we should prepare for. He could be funded privately by a Soros-style benefactor or perhaps he is an informer. Speculation will not solve the dilemma, but neither of these possibilities is far-fetched.</p>
<p>Just as so many rape accusations and poop swastika incidents have been debunked as hoaxes, the “Nazi” fringe of Donald Trump “supporters” is increasingly becoming the domain of liars and miscreants serving as the willing tools of both elites and a sensationalized liberal media.</p>
