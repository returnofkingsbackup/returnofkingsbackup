<p>TV has been rife with blue pill material for some time now. It seems you can’t turn on the box without witnessing a pathetic example of emasculated manhood or white-knighting fuckery. Every so often, however, you get a gem, a beacon of masculinity that shines brightly through the morass of betatude.</p>
<p>Today’s gem is Netflix’s new original series, House of Cards.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_mhjrkb0wsj1s1kd97o1_500.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11340" alt="tumblr_mhjrkb0wsj1s1kd97o1_500" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_mhjrkb0wsj1s1kd97o1_500.png"></a></p>
<p>The show is about a hard charging veteran US Congressman named Frank Underwood who essentially wheels and deals circles around his political opponents. He gets ahead using a remarkable (and ruthless) intellect combined with a sheer force of will, his greatest weapon resting in his ability to embody what we here in the manosphere consider an “alpha male”. Each episode is an exercise in alphadom—the man regularly breaks the will of his opponents and even goes as far as to intimidate the President of the United States. Think of a massively more realistic and gritty version of West Wing and you’ve essentially got the idea. That realism and grit is probably why this show, unlike West Wing, isn’t on network TV.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/house_of_cards2-620x412-e1369287882799.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11332" alt="house_of_cards2-620x412" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/house_of_cards2-620x412-e1369287882799.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Frank has a wife named Claire, played by Robin Wright (perhaps best remembered as “Jennie” from Forrest Gump).</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/64938370201302061515571232523870149_002-e1369287949861.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11337" alt="64938370201302061515571232523870149_002" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/64938370201302061515571232523870149_002-e1369287949861.jpg"></a></p>
<p>You get the picture: tall, trim, blonde and blue eyed, she’s pretty much the American dream, the prototype of what many an American male spends his days fantasizing about and white-knighting for. She’s also the embodiment of the kind of woman that only a real alpha male like Frank could have gotten: extremely hypergamous, highly ambitious, fully aware of her beauty and its power, and absolutely repulsed by the sight of weak men.</p>
<p>In Episode Six, Claire visits a sick former employee of Frank’s. The man, named Steve, had been Frank’s bodyguard for eight years. He now has cancer, is stuck in a hospital bed and will soon die. He sends a direct text message to Claire asking her to come visit him in person, where he essentially takes the opportunity to confess his love to her. I’m sure he expected some sympathy. He received instead a very healthy, potent dose of the red pill… from a woman.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Steve</strong>: I hate your husband. </em></p>
<p><strong>Claire</strong>: A lot of people do.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong>: The past eight years I watched over him. But it wasn’t him I was watching. And every time I saw you, every time I heard your voice, all I could think to myself was ‘Jesus what I would give’… I can’t tell you how many times I thought about that.</p>
<p><strong>Claire</strong>: You know what Francis said to me when he proposed? I remember his exact words. He said, ‘Claire, if all you want is happiness, say no. I’m not gonna give you a couple of kids and count the days until retirement. I promise you freedom from that. I promise you’ll never be bored.’</p>
<p>And you know, he was the only man, and there were a lot of others who proposed, he was the only one who understood me. He didn’t put me on some pedestal. He knew that I didn’t want to be adored or coddled. So he took my hand and he put a ring on it…because he knew I would say yes. He’s a man who knows how to take what he wants.</p>

<p>What we have illustrated here is a perfect example of the reality men must face when they take the red pill. Here we have a decent, honorable man (a typical beta male or “nice guy”) who thought he could win points with an attractive woman by putting down her “asshole” husband. He confesses his love for her and essentially admits that he has had her on a pedestal for a very long time.</p>
<p>She responds by telling him explicitly why she loves that “asshole”. She doesn’t want to be on a pedestal. She’s attractive, and has had many (probably hundreds if not thousands) of men put her there but she simply never wanted their adoration or coddling—those things are worth less than mud to her.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hoc-ph-22120r-babd299b44de4b096fc2d563c31bb2398737e5d5-s6-c10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11335" alt="hoc-ph-22120r-babd299b44de4b096fc2d563c31bb2398737e5d5-s6-c10" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/hoc-ph-22120r-babd299b44de4b096fc2d563c31bb2398737e5d5-s6-c10.jpg"></a></p>
<p>She desired a man with the confidence and force of will not to beg her to be with him or worship at her altar and hope for her acquiescence, but rather to simply take her. And she responded very positively to the one man who offered her this, because that is the only kind of man she could respect.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HOUSE-OF-CARDS_510x380.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11331" alt="HOUSE-OF-CARDS_510x380" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HOUSE-OF-CARDS_510x380.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Rest assured that there are many women like Claire out there. Chances are that if you’re in a major city or on a college campus, you cross paths with dozens of them every day. They’re attractive and they have many male suitors, all of whom pine for her on a regular basis and wish to give her the world.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to do the same. But know that if you do, you will just be another afterthought in her mind. For these women do not remember the many men who coddle them, worship them and place them on the pedestals they don’t want to be on. Sure, the women are aware of who those men are and understand that they exist, but they don’t register at all as sexual options. In fact, a part of these women despises those men for putting them in a position (pedestalized goddess) they have no desire to be in.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11339" alt="claire" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/claire.jpg"></p>
<p>The man they do respond to is the one with the force of will to seize what he wants and to rise above the level of the average beta.</p>
<p>While said beta seeks to coddle and shield her at every opportunity, <strong><em>he</em></strong> lets her breathe. While the beta places her on a pedestal and treats her like a goddess or an invaluable ornament, <strong><em>he</em></strong> treats her like the fallible, human female she knows she is.</p>
<p>The beta offers her nothing more than a boring marriage with 2.5 kids, a white picket fence and a chance to count the days until retirement, while <strong><em>he</em></strong> offers her excitement and opportunity to go along with any ideas of family he might have.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_miaak0QYOV1re28qmo1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11341" alt="tumblr_miaak0QYOV1re28qmo1_500" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/tumblr_miaak0QYOV1re28qmo1_500.jpg"></a></p>
<p>It is in your best interest to become <strong><em>him</em></strong>. Don’t be content to remain among the masses of discarded beta fodder, especially if you ever hope to attract a woman of this physical caliber in a society like this.</p>
<p>And watch House of Cards.</p>
