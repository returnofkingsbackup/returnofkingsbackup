<p>Intellectual curiosity is a trait common in many men. Guys like to figure stuff out and know things. Whether it’s learning the mechanics of the internal combustion engine or analyzing events that led to rise and fall of ancient Rome, intellectual curiosity is the hallmark of any successful man.</p>
<p>So one might suspect that a learned man would also seek out intellectual traits in women when it comes time to look for a mate. On some level, the thinking and reading man yearns for a woman who is a deep-thinker like himself whom he can share philosophical discussions with and create a meaningful bond over their enlightened ideas and conversations.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, <a href="http://thecitybachelor.com/why-men-shouldnt-date-intellectual-women/" target="_blank">we don’t actually end up seeking out intellectualism in women</a>. Research continues to show that although men will say they value “being smart” in women, we don’t really mean it.</p>
<h3>Intellectual Women And Intelligent Women Are Not The Same Thing</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-114376 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/02/518170_3-1-300x400.jpg" width="324" height="432" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/02/518170_3-1-300x400.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/02/518170_3-1-667x889.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/02/518170_3-1-262x349.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/02/518170_3-1-574x765.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2017/02/518170_3-1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px"></p>
<p>An <b>intellectual </b>woman tends to drown herself in progressive ideology, radical liberalism, and feminist dogma. Her young mind is brimming with curiosity at a vulnerable and impressionable age. And like clockwork the education factory and media establishment begin vomiting out propaganda and selling her their false bill of goods.</p>
<p>Taking Salon and Jezebel as the gospel, she describes herself as a “free-spirit” and loathes being objectified for her overt sexuality as she dances topless at EDM festivals in hopes of enticing a famous DJ. She complains to her friends about being viewed as a sexual commodity right before <a href="http://thecitybachelor.com/princessprostitute-paradox-observing-sugar-babies-wild/" target="_blank">she signs up for her online sugar baby account</a> so can make money as a sexual commodity.</p>
<p>But hey when she’s not slutting it up or <a href="http://thecitybachelor.com/how-to-get-laid-on-instagram/" target="_blank">filtering through hundreds of DMs on Instagram</a>, maybe she’s watching some interesting documentaries or admiring the prose of her favorite 18th century writer. While she may exceed your wildest expectations in philosophical discussion, the free-spirited thinker likely also has a notch count to exceed your wildest expectations. (And no, it’s not “only” 30 like she says.)</p>
<h3>Intellectual women are almost always the sluttiest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-47311" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/girls.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="278"></p>
<p>When I look back on the women I’ve had the deepest conversations with, almost all of them turned out to be… well, massive sluts with self-destructive tendencies. It seems intellectualism and promiscuity often go hand in hand.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Does she consider herself to be an activist for liberal pet causes, quick to dole out opinions via social media <a href="http://thecitybachelor.com/news-junkie-bad-soul/" target="_blank">regarding the latest news story</a>? Then it’s probably safe to assume she’s “sexually empowered” to the point that any attempts at monogamy are futile. Did you lay on the grass with her at Bonnaroo and talk about the meaning of life while staring up at the stars? You’re the third guy she’s banged that week while high on molly. So you spent an hour on the first date enthusiastically discussing the wonders of the Cosmos science documentary? You might be getting laid that night but there’s a 50/50 chance her vagina is as wide as the Andromeda galaxy.</p>
<p>The “chill” “free-spirited” “down-to-earth” girls might keep your mind stimulated and interest piqued, but enough experience with them will teach you it is all a Siren song. I’ve seen too many men (myself included) try to turn these women into something they cannot be – loyal committed girlfriends. Enjoy them from an emotional distance if you’d like, but in the end they will be the cause of your greatest suffering if you think they are capable of commitment to one man.</p>
<p>When we say we want a woman who is intelligent, this is not what we had in mind.</p>
<h3>Intelligent vs. Intellectual</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-57012" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/classy-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/classy-300x293.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/classy-262x256.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/classy.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>An <b>intelligent </b>woman is someone who understands her biological nature and on some level, whether conscious or sub-conscious, recognizes the subtle underpinnings of male-female mating dynamics. While she may not be able to articulate it, she has the social intelligence to realize that the more men she gives her sexuality away to, the less value her sexuality commands for winning over a long-term relationship with a high-value self-respecting man.</p>
<p>She sees feminism for the fraud that it is. She doesn’t ignore and put off her natural urges to pursue commitment and motherhood even though she’s “only 23”. And she doesn’t care to experience every flavor of man the world has to offer. She just wants to find a good man and knows what she needs to be in order to land him. Class and standards are of the utmost importance to her. <em>This</em> is the kind of intelligence men value in women.</p>
<p>But finding a woman who is able to combine intellectual curiosity with these kinds of relationship-material qualities is quite the struggle, possibly even a myth. It may not always be as black-and-white as what’s described above. But in your wife-hunting endeavors, it’s much safer and wiser to prioritize discretion, standards, and other wholesome qualities over free-spirited intellectualism.</p>
