<p>We all encounter those girls who stick in our minds like a bubblegum pop song. You’ll be sitting at a coffee shop reading a good book and without even seeing her you’ll feel her presence and turn around. At your favorite club while everyone else is standing around, guys with beers at chest level and girls huddled in small groups, she is lost in her own world dancing like a goddess on the dance floor. Time seems to slow as you two make eye contact. You go over and start dancing, inhaling her intoxicating feminine aroma as you two intermingle.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about past lovers who gave me instantaneous and primal desire, the ones who after a night of sex I still couldn’t get enough of, and even the girls who I can remember clear as day even though we never spoke. There was the traditionally feminine Eastern European girl I used to see. The “lesbian” who kind of looked like Miley Cyrus. The hourglass redhead whom I banged behind the club one night. The Nordic huntress who passed me in a crosswalk once. Even though I didn’t get the chance to talk to her I remember everything about the way she walked. It was like she was the happiest girl in the world.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/femininity-viking.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11438" alt="femininity viking" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/05/femininity-viking.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then it hit me. I finally figured out what made these girls so different from all the others I’d met: happiness and a positive attitude. That alone made me remember these girls more than the ones who tell me “we can’t have sex tonight because I’ve been having too many one night stands lately”, the ones who show up stumbling drunk to a date, or the ones who claim to have “attitude” in hopes that they’re unique.</p>
<p>The girls I remember most may not have embodied traditional femininity, but they sure were a pleasure to be around. Even though I fucked a girl in a back alley she still stuck up for me when her roommate started giving me shit. She  apologized with a blowjob and noisy sex later in the night. The traditionally feminine girl asked me how I was doing every time I saw her and would make me exquisite cappuccinos. The “lesbian” offered me food and drink making sure I was comfortable even though we both knew it was going to be a one night stand.</p>

<p>It wasn’t just those small actions either. I thought back to when I’d met them and all of them were smiling, open and seemed like they hadn’t a care in the world. I thought back to the girls who I’ve almost forgotten and when I’d met them they were borderline angry, bitchy or would eventually start complaining.</p>

<p>I know you girls are out there reading this, looking for another post to hate, another post to ridicule. Stop right now and start thinking about things you are thankful for in your life. Put down your iPhones and smile for once, ask the Starbucks barista how their day is going. Girls can cruise by with a default negative demeanor so they don’t have to own up to the fact that their social skills are terrible. You have no obligation to change because a man tells you to, but if you don’t want to end up on <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-11111-post-444374.html#pid444374">Ok Cupid </a>with thousands of messages from thirsty simps you could do for an attitude adjustment. Screen your men by what you want in a man instead of what you don’t.</p>

<address>Girls: Do the complete opposite of this girl.</address>
<p>This advice goes for men too. The biggest “quick fix” for your success with women would be your attitude. If you’re happy and positive girls will (for the most part) be the same back. I used to walk around with a permanent scowl for no reason whatsoever. One day a girl of mine sent me a dirty text as I was walking around town. I looked up with a smirk on my face and girls started smiling back when before they’d just look away. When it comes down to it ‘game’ is just about having a good time so go out there and have some fun.</p>
