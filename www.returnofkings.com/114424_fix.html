<p>Gentlemen, I didn’t bother to watch the Superbowl. I know, I know—but when you don’t care about either of the teams, what’s the point?</p>
<p>In addition to not caring about which team won (I’m a Redskins fan and have long given up hope), I also hate the overtly socialist, multi-cultural Superbowl commercials that typically play. If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ll have noticed that they’ve been getting <em>progressively more and more obvious </em>over the past decade or so… and boys, this Superbowl was no exception.</p>
<p>Here’s 5 of the most blatantly globalist Superbowl commercials of 2017:</p>
<h3>1. Coca Cola</h3>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/5LaO8HR8x_Q%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Featured in Coca Cola’s super bowl commercial of 2017, is the song “America the Beautiful,” being sung in multiple languages. Again, this is just so overtly pro-globalist I’m struggling with what to say.</p>
<p>After all, what can be said? The entire song pictures the “beauty,” of all cultures—children are seen playing games, young adults are dancing, it seems like a great time. Of course, they forgot to leave out the fact that <a href="http://silenceisconsent.net/viral-iraq-soldier-tells-truth-about-iraqi-citizens/" target="_blank">most Iraqi citizens vehemently hate Americans</a>, and want us dead.</p>
<p>They forgot the fact that we’ve been at war with the Middle East for the past 16 years, but oh, no, don’t worry about that! Just listen to the pretty music and watch the cool scenery of peaceful individuals loving one another! Coca Cola is directly undermining the security of our nation by pushing this multi-cultural agenda, and it’s time to stop drinking their products for good.</p>
<h3>2. Audi</h3>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/qLvcMj3U4gA%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Oh, so it’s 2017 and we’re still pushing the wage gap myth? Despite the fact that Time Magazine and Forbes Magazine literally debunked this YEARS ago, greedy corporate whores and bitter feminazis continue to spit out this lie.</p>
<p>This commercial starts off with a young cute little girl in a race, up against all boys, of course—her father gives a heart-wrenching speech about how women are being oppressed, again, to further this absurd oppressed vs. oppressor cultural Marxist narrative. Here’s a full transcript of the video:</p>
<blockquote><p>“What do I tell my daughter? Do I tell her that her grandpa’s worth more than her grandma? That her dad’s worth more than her mom? Do I tell her that, despite her education, her drive, her skills, her intelligence, she will automatically be valued as less than every man she ever meets? Or maybe, I’ll be able to tell her something different.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this is blatant anti-male, fourth wave college campus feminist propaganda. Don’t buy an Audi.</p>
<h3>3. 84 Lumber</h3>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/nPo2B-vjZ28%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Perhaps the most blatantly anti-Trump propaganda piece of all time, this commercial features a long and arduous journey made by a single mother with her young little girl. They journey far and wide, from some South American country, for miles and miles… only to be met by the Donald’s wall.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>There they stand, staring at said wall, in all hopelessness—they each shed their tears, and hug one another in a very emotional scene. Of course, this is nothing more than <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/102546/how-mainstream-tv-uses-emotional-triggers-to-sway-political-opinion" target="_blank">emotional propaganda</a> meant to sway your political opinions, though. At the end of the commercial, the mother and her daughter push through the wall’s doorway, and the scene ends with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The will to succeed is always welcome here.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, so let me get this straight—two ILLEGAL immigrants come up from South America, and they’re condoning this? How disgusting is that? Again, the bleeding heart liberals will cry and complain and moan and whine about how “Muh feelings!” but the truth remains that we cannot accept illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>We have a system to help them come here, <em>if they abide by said system. </em>I’m sorry, but it’s just not financially possible to continue taking on so many illegal immigrants, with zero education. They’re a massive burden to the tax payers, and it needs to end—we need the wall.</p>
<h3>4. AirBnB</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qUTYHnLz2g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qUTYHnLz2g</a></p>
<p>As beautiful piano music plays in the background, a collage of different skin colors and ethnicities are overlayed upon one another. Sentences appear, one by one, as the music plays, leaving us with a bunch of “good feels,” and “muh emotions.” Here is what is said in the commercial:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, so basically they’re saying that being a violent extremist who wants to throw acid on a woman’s face for showing her ankles, is the same as someone who goes to Church every Sunday and donates 10% of his income to charity? Nice try, Soros.</p>
<p>Again, this is riddled with Leftist propaganda—obviously it would be nice if the whole world could get along, but this is CLEARLY not possible, and in fact, trying to do so is often quite dangerous. I don’t know about you guys, but I’m going to stop using AirBnB.</p>
<h3>5. Mr. Clean</h3>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/GDzMxlw2Fgo%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The video shows a sexy Mr. Clean dancing and flirting with some woman, who is in complete awe over him, as Justin Timberlake’s suggestive music plays in the background. Then, near the end of the commercial, “Sarah,” this girl, snaps out of it. She is greeted by her beta-male, cuck-looking husband who is completely <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/lack-masculinity-root-cause-problems/" target="_blank">lacking in any and all masculinity</a>.</p>
<p>Despite his unkempt appearance, and chubby belly, she jumps on top of him, ready to make love—the message is, be a good little boy and clean for your wife! It doesn’t matter that the majority of American women don’t cook or clean anymore, because you could get sex if you clean!</p>
<p>The commercial ends by saying: “You gotta love a man who cleans,” urging beta-cuck husbands to take up a traditionally female role. Poor guy. If only he could learn <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/actually-alpha-male-mindsets-vs-behaviors/" target="_blank">how to be an alpha male</a>.</p>
