<p>A great body is great. But a set of shredded six pack abs is the pinnacle of aesthetic achievement when it comes to men’s fitness; and for good reason.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/-GTZL_TNi7w.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>For starters, a six pack has shown to be the ultimate weapon when it comes to slaying the pick-up game (just ask Connor Murphy). However as we’ll uncover in this article, the benefits of having six pack abs go far beyond cracking the code of female attraction.</p>
<p>But let me first make one thing clear; along with great abs, comes great responsibility – If you want to reap the rewards of having a shredded six pack, then you’ll have to withstand the inevitable grind that comes along with achieving them.</p>
<h3>Cons Of Having Six Pack Abs As A Man</h3>
<p><strong>You Can’t Eat At McDonald’s.<br>
</strong><br>
It should come as no surprise that eating off the dollar menu won’t get you McShredded. Not only that, but it also super sizes your chances of suffering from long-term health complications that are linked to eating highly modified fast foods – Hint: You’ll be McDiabetic before you hit the age of retirement.</p>
<p>Now I’m not saying you have to follow some miserably strict diet in order to get a ripped six pack – But what I am saying is that if you have a fast food habit that involves eating anything deep fried, battered, or artificially sweetened – you need to give it a swift McKick. Instead, choose fast foods that are baked, grilled or prepared fresh; like Chipotle’s Burrito Bowl or Chick-Fil-A’s Grilled Chicken Wrap.</p>
<p><strong>You Need To Spend Time In The Gym.<br>
</strong><br>
Hate to break it to you, but there’s no magic wand for your waistline – A hard midsection takes hard work.</p>
<p>So if you’re going to make getting ripped six pack abs a priority, you’re going to need to manage your free time a bit differently. You’ll need to determine which exercises are best for achieving the sculpted six pack you’re looking for and also lay out a weekly workout schedule, one that you can commit to.</p>
<p>Otherwise you’ll end up like a lot of guys do – aimlessly wandering from machine to machine, hoping that “an honest effort” will pay off (spoiler alert: it never does).</p>
<p><strong>Gym Memberships Ain’t Cheap.<br>
</strong><br>
The average cost of a standard gym membership these days is between $80 to $220 a month, and that’s not including the start-up fee, personal training package or group fitness add-ons. Tally that up with the gas fee from traveling to and from the gym every day, and you’re looking at a pretty substantial investment in both money and time – two assets that most guys can’t seem to get enough of.</p>
<p>Now the price of getting ripped six pack abs might appear to be pretty steep – but the price of being out of shape can be even more costly down the road. It can cost you your confidence, your self-image and most notably, your chances of getting laid.</p>
<p><strong>It Can Be Hard To Find A Trainer You Trust.<br>
</strong><br>
Social media has reshaped the frontier of fitness. Instead of setting up one of those awkward in-person training consultations, you can just kick back and shop around online for fitness advice – but with so many options, it can be difficult to find the advice you need to get into killer shape.</p>
<p>The reality? Any tool bag with a mediocre six pack and an Instagram account is now “accepting clients” in their DM.</p>
<p>Now don’t get me wrong, many of these self proclaimed fitness gurus may know a thing or two when it comes to taking a mean selfie, but when it comes to helping other guys attain their own selfie-worthy six pack, well – lighting and Adobe Photoshop skills don’t really apply.</p>
<p>It’s like this: Asking a ripped guy (whether it’s at the gym or on social media) how to get ripped without knowing his training background or credentials is like buying a used car from a salesmen without looking at the vehicle history report.</p>
<p>If you don’t get qualified advice that’s scientifically validated and suitable to your personal needs, you could potentially be investing in a huge mistake – a mistake that your health may have to pay for. So don’t write checks that your six pack can’t cash.</p>

<p><strong>Six Packs Score Female Attention.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>It’s true that some women think that the six pack look is “too extreme”, which is why so many dudes are shamelessly sporting dad bods these days (and are somehow still pulling chicks, regardless of looking like a sack full of sloppy joes).</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>In my opinion, women don’t actually think dad bods are attractive – Instead, what they really find attractive about the dad bod is the fact that there will be no pressure for her to look a certain way nor will she ever be threatened by other women lusting after him since, well, he’s a slob.</p>
<p>That being said, whether a woman thinks that abs are overkill or she’s a dedicated dad bod devotee, the bottom line is… A six pack will always make her look. Even if she doesn’t consciously mean to, when a girl sees a guy who has ripped six pack abs, she can’t help but notice… And in most cases, stare.</p>
<p>Since it’s harder for women to achieve the same rock hard midsection that men are capable of building (estrogen being the culprit), they instantly feel a psychological attraction to the level of dedication and discipline required to achieving the physical paramount that is a ripped six pack. This means that by simply taking your shirt off, you’ll be the center of attention – can you say confidence boost?</p>
<p><strong>You’ll Have More Energy In The Tank.</strong></p>
<p>When you exercise, your body is using energy (calories). If you’re on a mission to get a ripped six pack and start exercising on a daily basis, your body will automatically increase the amount of energy it produces because it already knows you’ll be burning through tons more energy than normal.</p>
<p>This is the basic science of how your metabolism works.</p>
<p>When we do nothing, our body knows that it won’t be needing energy, so it produces very little. This is why when we lay around and bum it up all day we tend to still feel tired – even if all we did was veg out. However, when we start doing <a href="http://go2.sixpackshortcuts.com/aff_c?offer_id=6&amp;aff_id=6325&amp;source=rok-are-six-pack-abs-really-worth-it?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">ab shredding workouts</a>, we use a lot more energy than usual. As a result, the body increases its energy output in anticipation for the next workout and uses up a ton of energy.</p>
<p><strong>More Abs, More Money.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>We already know that getting a ripped six pack is the ultimate conquest for a head-turn worthy appearance, but what most of us fail to grasp is how having six pack abs can actually earn you more money in the workplace.</p>
<p>And no, I’m not talking about Magic Mike-ing your way to a higher income.</p>
<p>In a new study published in the June issue of the Journal of Labor Research, researchers have found that employees who regularly exercise earn 9% more than their lazier counterparts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, guys who work out regularly, as in at least three times per week, are more productive at work than those who don’t, according to research published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.</p>
<p>Those who get sufficient exercise also miss fewer workdays (bosses really like), according to the same study. Those absences can translate to lost income and lost opportunities for advancement.</p>
<p>Finally, guys who are in incredible shape live longer, so their nest egg will rack up more interest.</p>
<p>Plain and simple… Being in shape gets you ahead in life.</p>
<h3>The Conclusion<u><br>
