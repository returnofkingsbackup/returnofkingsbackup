<p>The music industry, alongside the movie industry, has been at the forefront of leftist causes, promoting their agenda through the <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/does-the-hollywood-elite-use-rituals-and-sexual-blackmail-to-keep-its-stars-in-line">pop stars of the day</a>. This included Bob Dylan, who was actively involved in the black Civil Rights movement. He produced a song called “The Times They Are A-Changing'” to persuade white people and Congressmen to adopt a far-left agenda to institutionalize white guilt more effectively. While the song was intended as an admonishment to conservatives to get with the times, it can now be re-imagined as a boastful screed against modern liberals.</p>

<blockquote><p>Come gather ’round people<br>
Wherever you roam<br>
And admit that the waters<br>
Around you have grown<br>
And accept it that soon<br>
You’ll be drenched to the bone<br>
If your time to you<br>
Is worth savin’<br>
Then you better start swimmin’<br>
Or you’ll sink like a stone<br>
For the times they are a-changin’.</p></blockquote>
<p>Admit that <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/youre-either-a-globalist-or-a-nationalist">multiculturalism and globalism</a> has failed. These ideologies are not compatible with the nature of humanity, and so it must be discarded before it leads to the ruin of you and your loved ones. There are only two sexes, all races are different, and borders are essential for nations. We gave neo-liberalism a chance, but it has put the world on the precipice of civilizational collapse, after already destroying our souls, and now you must accept that the times are a changing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Come writers and critics<br>
Who prophesize with your pen<br>
And keep your eyes wide<br>
The chance won’t come again<br>
And don’t speak too soon<br>
For the wheel’s still in spin<br>
And there’s no tellin’ who<br>
That it’s namin’<br>
For the loser now<br>
Will be later to win<br>
For the times they are a-changin’.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those of you who work in the controlled <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/how-to-destroy-the-establishment-media">mainstream media</a>, who betray your nation with every word you type, all for a measly salary, you must accept the will of the American people. Present them with the truth instead of acting as the communist opposition party. In the past, your content controlled the collective minds of the nation, but it has become impotent and ineffective, a laughing stock that makes your job on par with that of being a cocktail waitress. Your power is fading, so raise you right hand to your temple and salute the great flag of America, because the times are a changing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come senators, congressmen<br>
Please heed the call<br>
Don’t stand in the doorway<br>
Don’t block up the hall<br>
For he that gets hurt<br>
Will be he who has stalled<br>
There’s a battle outside<br>
And it is ragin’<br>
It’ll soon shake your windows<br>
And rattle your walls<br>
For the times they are a-changin’.</p>

<p>If you’re a Congressman, tell your billionaire sponsor that you don’t fear their blackmail, because now you must aid in passing Trump’s agenda. If not, you will be steamrolled by him and your disgruntled constituency. Quit the cuckold behavior and execute the needed measures that defeat globalism. We don’t want to hear excuses and we don’t want to see you plug your fingers in your ears. Either represent us or we’ll find someone who does, because the times are a changing.</p>
<blockquote><p>Come mothers and fathers<br>
Throughout the land<br>
And don’t criticize<br>
What you can’t understand<br>
Your sons and your daughters<br>
Are beyond your command<br>
Your old road is<br>
Rapidly agin’<br>
Please get out of the new one<br>
If you can’t lend your hand<br>
For the times they are a-changin’.</p></blockquote>
<p>Boomer parents, you have failed in the raising of your millennial sons and daughters. You are sending them to universities as children and they’re coming back to you after four years as infants, saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in debt while you suck away the remaining wealth of the nation. This is your failing as much as it is theirs. You have <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-a-social-justice-warrior-sjw">not taught them to be adults</a>, not taught them the ways of tradition, not taught them how to succeed in American society. You have created the biggest class of mentally ill individuals the world has seen, so we demand you make way for those who have been raised right, who know the truth, and whose righteous speech has been heard in spite of you children’s efforts to censor them. Grab your insolent spawn and step aside, because the times are a changing.</p>
<blockquote><p>The line it is drawn<br>
The curse it is cast<br>
The slow one now<br>
Will later be fast<br>
As the present now<br>
Will later be past<br>
The order is<br>
Rapidly fadin’<br>
And the first one now<br>
Will later be last<br>
For the times they are a-changin’.</p></blockquote>
<p>While you were crowing about ‘the end of history’ during the Obama era, and salivating at the prospect of a permanent progressive state, we were sharpening our swords and tongues. Your new world order is dead, and the new one will fix the grievous harm you’ve done to society in the false name of virtue and progress. Get on board now or be left in the dust, because the times are a changing, and we’re not going back to how things were.</p>
<p>Thank you Bob Dylan for writing our theme song, and if that wasn’t your intention, too bad, because it’s our song now.</p>
