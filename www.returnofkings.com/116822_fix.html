<p>On the 8<sup>th</sup> of March, 2017, a large number of Western women played hookie; indeed, in connection with the protests that were taken by women against President Donald Trump in January of 2017, the organizers of those protests called on women to skip work on the 8<sup>th</sup> of March in order to show their strength and influence in society.</p>
<p>And so, the 8<sup>th</sup> of March came, and passed, and do you know what happened? Nothing. Or at least nothing significant. Indeed, Donald Trump stayed President, businesses kept running, and the United States still exists. Now, it is granted that, in all likelihood, relatively few women participated in this joke-of-a-protest, because a decent number of women are—thank God!—still intelligent enough to see through such a farce. Nevertheless, this whole event is still instructive as it offers us a chance to reflect on what would really happen if such an event were taken seriously.</p>
<div id="attachment_116832" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-116832 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marchers.jpg" width="500" height="280" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marchers.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marchers-300x168.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Marchers-262x147.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Women DO deserve better…better than the lies that feminists feed them.</p>
</div>
<p>Imagine, for a moment, that all women in the Western world really did take a day off work; all they did was stay home and watch their children (if they had any). What would happen? Oh, there would be major disruptions no doubt. Young children might lack some of their teachers. Doctors might have to take blood for the absent nurses and jerry-rig a few operations. The one lone male in human resources might get overwhelmed. And a number of men might have to get called in for some overtime.</p>
<p>Ironically, a lot of women might also find out that they are happier in the home rather than being a corporate drone. But nevertheless, on this imaginary ‘women-less’ day, civilization would continue moving forward; a few people would seriously suffer here and there, but society as we know it would continue chugging along. Food would still be in the fridge. Traffic and deliveries would continue. And life would go on. In fact, if we knew in advance when this “Day Without Women” would be, then men could largely mitigate the effects that this would have on society. So there would be pain, but this pain would be temporary, and soon things would be back to normal.</p>
<div id="attachment_116834" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-116834 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Rioting.jpg" width="500" height="334" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Rioting.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Rioting-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Rioting-262x175.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">What happens when civilized men aren’t there to keep a lid on disorder and violence.</p>
</div>
<p>But now imagine, just for a second, that society experienced a “Day Without Men”. Indeed, imagine that all the men in the Western world, all at the same time, truly decided not to work for a day no matter what happened. All men stopped working for one full day. And imagine that this was known in advance.</p>
<p>You know what would happen? Well, think of what has happened in the past when the police—a largely male profession, especially on the front lines—went on strike. There would be riots, civil unrest, looting, and a serious increase in criminality. People would die in fires and car accidents due to the lack of firefighters; in fact, fires that might normally get contained would spread and cause much more devastation than normal. Deliveries of food and essentially services would cease to a trickle. Power outages and other major mechanical and electrical concerns would have almost no one to address them.</p>
<p>Terrorist attacks would likely sky-rocket given the lack of any serious armed response to the terrorist threat. And worst of all, the Western world would likely be invaded and destroyed. Seriously! If the enemies of the West knew that men—who comprise the bulk of all fighting forces for Western militaries—were taking the day off, would they not seize the opportunity to strike. After all, who would be manning the guns on the gates of a military camp or on an aircraft carrier? Who would be piloting the fighters to repel an enemy air attack? Who would be guarding our embassies and responding to any threats? Who would be manning the command posts to launch our nuclear arsenal in case of an attack?</p>

<p>Would not, for example, North Korea sweep through the South if it knew for sure that all the men in South Korea and Japan had taken the day off? Of course it would! Now, for sure, there are women in the military, and many of them would no doubt do a fine job trying to compensate for the lack of men, but a female soldier in a support trade is no front-line marine, and in nearly all military contests, a group of well-trained men will defeat a group of well-trained women any day of the week. So the fact remains that without men for a day, the West would be vulnerable in a potentially civilization-ending way.</p>
<div id="attachment_116833" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-116833 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/north-korean-army.jpg" width="500" height="280" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/north-korean-army.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/north-korean-army-300x168.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/north-korean-army-262x147.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Not going to be stopped by Western feminists!</p>
</div>
<p>So, what do these little thought-experiments show us? Well, they give us a glimpse of reality; a reality that cannot be concealed no matter how much modern feminists wish to hide it. And that reality is the following: in terms of their <em>immediate</em> importance, women are not indispensable to society, for everything that a woman does outside the home, a man can do as well. A man can be a nurse; he can be a teacher; he can be a day-care worker.</p>
<p>On the other hand, men—given their greater physical strength and aggression—fill most of the roles that are needed to maintain the stability and protection of society on a day-to-day basis, and so men are indispensable to society in an immediate sense. Indeed, society could relatively easily survive a day without women, but it might <em>not </em>survive a day without men, for whereas the former situation would be like getting kicked in the balls, the latter would be like getting shot—you might survive, but you might also die.</p>
<div id="attachment_116835" style="width: 397px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-116835 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-with-baby.jpg" width="387" height="387" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-with-baby.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-with-baby-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-with-baby-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-with-baby-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/03/woman-with-baby-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px"><p class="wp-caption-text">The one thing that men cannot do…and the most critical thing to the maintenance of civilization too.</p>
</div>
<p>Now, does all this mean that women are not indispensable to Western civilization? Of course not. Women, being supremely well-suited to the birthing and nurturing of children, are indispensable to civilization, for children—meaning future citizens—are the fuel that keeps a civilization running. And since, without women, there would be no children, and hence no future civilization, then obviously, women are critical to the maintenance and survival of a civilization.</p>
<p>However, unlike men, and unlike the message that the organizers of the “Day Without Women” want to convey, women are indispensable in the long-term sense, whereas men are indispensable in the short-term. And so this is the key point: men and women are both indispensable to society, but they are indispensable in complementary ways, not in the same way. So feminists need to stop trying to pretend that women are men or that women are vital to a civilization in the same way that men are. They are not, and that is just reality.</p>
<p>And the sooner that we accept that reality, the better it will be for all of us.</p>
