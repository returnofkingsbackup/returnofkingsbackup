<p>Whether it’s for work or pleasure, when you’re on the road it’s all too easy to abandon everything you know about eating healthy. As a result, many men tend find themselves struggling to button up their pants by the time they get home. But weight loss experts have confirmed that the following micro modifications will not only allow you to avoid belly fat gain while you’re on the go – but also, help you shed unwanted weight.</p>
<h3><strong>Plan to walk</strong></h3>
<p>Packing a pair of walking shoes could be the easiest way to ensure you stay on track with your weight loss goals. If you’re traveling for vacation, walking will let you sneak in a calorie burn without sacrificing precious relaxation time.</p>
<p>A quick way to rev up a leisurely stroll is with bouts of brisk walking. This could be as simple as picking a landmark and walking briskly until you reach your target, walking at a relaxed pace until you recover and then repeating. If there is a hilly landscape, go for it.</p>
<p>If you’re traveling for business, the same rules apply – If you get to choose your hotel, choose one that is within walking distance to your business destination so that you can kick start your calorie burning furnace.</p>
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Plan a 15-25 minute walk each morning before breakfast. This will ignite your fat-burning metabolism which will allow your body to handle the influx of calories you’ll be taking in while you’re out of your normal routine.</p>
<h3><strong>Skip Elevators – Take The Stairs<u><br>
</u></strong></h3>
<p>While you’re traveling, every bit of exercise will go a long way – especially if you’re a guy who is used to being active during your normal weekly routine at home. Opting out of the elevator every time you get a chance and choosing the stairs instead is a simple way to knock out compound exercise – the type of exercise that just so happens to be the best for increasing testosterone and burning belly fat.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-tip:</strong> If you really want to take advantage of the t-boosting compound exercise benefits, try taking steps that clear two stairs at a time, instead of one. This simple adjustment requires more force, which means more muscle activation, which means more test will be released into your bloodstream – enhancing fat burn.</p>
<h3><strong>Try To Avoid Booze</strong></h3>
<p>You’ve already come to terms that you won’t be following a normal eating schedule, and that’s ok – As long as you’ve committed yourself to making small accommodations to your schedule to allow for exercise using the tips above, there’s no problem with enjoying a more relaxed diet while you’re on the go. But when you combine alcohol with junk food, you can almost guarantee that you’ll be traveling home with some extra baggage in your belly compartment. This is because alcohol slows the metabolism down big time – so if you’re slowing your metabolism and also eating unhealthy choices at the same time, you can almost guarantee that these calories won’t be burned but instead, stored as body fat.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Statistically, anything more than 2 drinks will begin to have a negative effect on your fat-burning metabolism. So if you must drink, try to drink vodka with sugar free mixers such as sugar free RedBull or diet soda and be sure to void sugary cocktails and margaritas.</p>
<h3><strong>Pick Out Restaurants In Advance</strong></h3>
<p>When you pick a restaurant just based on convenience, accessibility or how close it is to you on your smart phone GPS, you might find yourself sitting down to a plateful of junk food. Not only should you research restaurants and make an eating-out plan ahead of time, but you can also check out the menu to any chow spot you want online so you can see if they have menu options that won’t blow out your waistline.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> There are tons of food apps that you can use that will help you choose healthy choices that don’t just taste great, but that are also incredibly satisfying – Try the free “Zomato” app on your smartphone and check out all of the filters.</p>

<h3><strong>Bring A Reusable Water Bottle</strong></h3>
<p>Research has shown that over 50% of “hunger cravings” that people experience are actually misinterpreted signals from the brain – The majority of these starvation signals are actually trying to tell you is that your body is dehydrated.</p>
<p>When you’re dehydrated, you’re more likely to confuse thirst as hunger, leading you to overeat. To overcome this, aim to follow the 8×8 rule while traveling: Drink 8 glasses of 8oz water a day.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> When choosing a reusable water bottle, avoid plastics. Plastic bottles contain estrogen-like chemicals that can disrupt your testosterone production, skew your hormones and lead to weight gain. Grab a glass or stainless steel option instead.</p>
<h3><strong>Don’t Skimp On Sleep</strong></h3>
<p>Travel is already taxing on the body, but losing sleep is even more so.</p>
<p>When you miss out on your Z’s, you are setting your body and brain up to be fatigued. If your body and brain are fatigued, it’ll feel impossible to muster up the energy to get active. More so, the later you stay up, the greater chance there is of you making poor decisions when it comes to late night snacking or last call drinks. Getting an adequate amount of sleep—around 7-8 hours a night—will help you feel rested, energized, and it can help keep you strong so you can stay healthy on your trip.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong>: If you have trouble falling asleep while traveling, you can try playing peaceful sound scapes or try a relaxing stretching routine through your smart phone right before bed.</p>
<h3><strong>Remember To Eat Breakfast</strong></h3>
<p>Just because your hotel continental breakfast is a carb-carnival doesn’t mean that you can’t make it work.</p>
<p>Based on decades of diet research, one variable remained constant: eating breakfast is a habit for successful long term weight loss. One study that examined data on dieters who dropped more than 30 pounds and kept if off showed that more than two-thirds of those participants ate breakfast everyday.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> If you’re going the complimentary breakfast route, many hotels offer these clean eats: hard boiled eggs, whole grain cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, and yogurt. Stick with these options instead of the bagels or muffins.</p>
<h3><strong>Take Advantage Of Hotel Amenities, Or Better Yet – Your Hotel Room.</strong></h3>
<p>In this day and age, it’s a rare find to stay in a hotel that doesn’t include some sort of gym or exercise amenity. Even if it’s just dumbbells and a couple treadmills, you can get a killer sweat session in fast and be ready to take on your day.</p>
<p><strong>Pro-Tip</strong>: If you really want to make sure you win the battle against belly fat while traveling, you can do these short <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id960768458?pt=117289880&amp;ct=rok-avoid-belly-fat-while-traveling&amp;mt=8?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">full body 15 minute workouts</a> without any equipment at all. You can do these right from your own hotel room and be burning calories for up to 48 hours after each quick session.</p>
<p><strong>The 15 Minute Travel Workout App I Personally Use</strong></p>
<p>If you ask me, nothing beats Fit In 15 workout app when you’re traveling. These workouts are only 15 minutes in length and require no equipment at all.
