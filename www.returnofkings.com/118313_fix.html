<p>Dark forces have been working for decades to put together an <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2007/05/41737/" target="_blank">unholy alliance</a> opposed to Western civilization. They may seem at times like a monolithic menace, but it’s really a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/97062/whats-worse-cultural-marxism-or-real-communism" target="_blank">hive-mind</a> with the wealthy, powerful, and influential forming a center of gravity. For example, the Open Society Foundation has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmMw9aMXmMY" target="_blank">countless front groups</a> worldwide, as well as <a href="http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2017/01/20/billionaire-george-soros-has-ties-to-more-than-50-partners-of-the-womens-march-on-washington/" target="_blank">others it funds</a> to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/12/16/soros-finances-group-helping-facebook-flag-disputed-stories/" target="_blank">do their bidding</a>.  Many also get <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/01/the-roots-of-black-lives-matter-unveiled/" target="_blank">lavish funding</a> from like-minded “philanthropic” funds.  Still, that doesn’t mean that everyone down to each activist on campus (or in <a href="http://takimag.com/article/the_week_that_perished_takimag_february_12_2017#axzz4YgBjC1jY" target="_blank">Mom’s basement</a>) is taking orders directly from Doctor Evil himself.</p>
<p>All the little servile bugs crawling around in The Hive actually have their own agendas, and generally act in a coalition of convenience. But—hard as it may be to believe—occasionally the drones will dare to start thinking for themselves. That’s quite perilous for them individually, as they could get swarmed and stung by their comrades.</p>
<p>Sometimes today’s horde eats its children. It’s not surprising that an ideology specifically designed to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116006/the-dysfunction-of-modern-society-is-proof-that-cultural-marxism-works" target="_blank">create disunity</a> has managed to do so within its own ranks. It’s always been that way—even before cultural Marxism existed—from the French Revolution onward.</p>
<h4>Leftists versus each other</h4>
<div id="attachment_118316" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-118316 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trotsky-MUERTE.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="390" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trotsky-MUERTE.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trotsky-MUERTE-300x234.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Trotsky-MUERTE-262x204.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh, did that icepick hurt, Comrade Trotsky?</p>
</div>
<p>Despite general agreement by the Granola Coalition on several major items, it’s the differences that can turn into real sticking points. Communists have no use for liberals, and many liberals consider Communists to be kooky fanatics barking up the wrong tree (and for good reason). The further left you get, the more quarrelsome things become.</p>
<p>Communism has several schools of thought; the major ones include the garden-variety Marxist-Leninists, the Maoists, and the Trotskyists (nobody can stand them). Cultural Marxism is the “Communism Lite” strain, with an iron grip on the educational system, the media, Hollywood and big corporations, and many other institutions that they infiltrated. The Marxist-Leninists consider “deviationism” from Communist orthodoxy a pretty serious matter; people have been shot for that.</p>
<p>During the <a href="http://irelandscw.com/band-CJMcG.htm" target="_blank">surreal chaos</a> of the Spanish Civil War, the leftist coalition apparently had much trouble keeping their rifles all pointed in the same direction, fighting each other almost as much as they were fighting their opponents. The pro-USSR faction was the most aggressive with the “my way or the highway” approach. Rival Communist groups (such as POUM) got thrown under the bus. There was little mercy for the anarchists and moderate Socialists, just as happened in the Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>In China, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95449/the-ugly-truth-of-leftist-heroes" target="_blank">Mao Zedong</a> cleverly manipulated a minor ideological quibble to stir up the Jacobin-like fury of the Cultural Revolution. That brought him back to power after he got sidelined for killing tens of millions with his half-baked Great Leap Forward scheme. On a broader scale, while the USA was pursuing a containment strategy against Communism, the Communists themselves were busy containing each other in Asia. Elsewhere in the developing world, many countries had two rival terrorist movements representing both the Maoist and Marxist-Leninist flavors.</p>
<p>Today, leftists aren’t shooting each other over these matters; instead, various factions of keyboard Red Guards bitch at each other online. (In a way, I miss the old days. If they’d have a Thunderdome-style reality show with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114177/what-the-university-of-california-berkeley-riot-means-for-america" target="_blank">Antifags</a> versus <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98924/how-a-communist-brainwashing-method-was-exported-to-the-united-states" target="_blank">critical theory</a> professors, I’d gladly pirate the episodes.) These days, the feminist flavor of cultural Marxism is the goofiest.</p>
<h4>Feminists versus women who don’t agree with them</h4>
<div id="attachment_47710" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-47710 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/red-hair-femnazi-1-500px.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281"><p class="wp-caption-text">Someone’s triggered.</p>
</div>
<p>Feminists are all about female empowerment, right? So in the 2008 Presidential election, when Sarah Palin had a shot at being the first female Vice President of the USA, were the feminists pleased? <em>Au contraire, mon frère.</em> They were caterwauling and saying filthy things about her. Ann Coulter also receives much immoderate screeching from feminists, as well as liberals for whom feminism is part of the package deal. She’s also far better-looking than any big-name feminist out there, which surely contributes to their hate-on more than any ideological disagreement.</p>
<p>Sure, Coulter and Palin are outspoken conservatives and you’d expect this from leftists. Even so, liberal women who step away from the Party Line can get thrown under the bus. For example, Camille Paglia is one of those exceedingly rare feminists who makes sense most of the time. For this reason, the Sisterhood treats her as a heretic. As she <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/authors/emma-teitel/camille-paglia-on-rob-ford-rihanna-and-rape-culture/" target="_blank">put it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Feminism is dead. The movement is absolutely dead. The women’s movement tried to suppress dissident voices for way too long. There’s no room for dissent. It’s just like Mean Girls. If they had listened to me they could have gotten the ship steered in the right direction. My wing of feminism—the pro-sex wing—was silenced. I was practically lynched for endorsing The Rolling Stones. Susan Faludi is still saying I’m not a feminist. Who made her pope? Feminist ideology is like a new religion for a lot of neurotic women. You can’t talk to them about anything.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well spoken! Feminist <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116535/the-redstockings-manifesto-was-the-blueprint-for-contemporary-feminism" target="_blank">solidarity for all women</a> goes right out the window for anyone disagreeing with them. Even weirder, some <em>soi-disant</em> women’s advocates don’t even understand what a woman is.</p>
<h4>Trannies and their enablers versus radical feminists</h4>
<div id="attachment_60009" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-60009" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bruce-Jenner-Becoming-a-Woman-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bruce-Jenner-Becoming-a-Woman-300x180.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bruce-Jenner-Becoming-a-Woman-667x400.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bruce-Jenner-Becoming-a-Woman-262x157.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bruce-Jenner-Becoming-a-Woman-574x344.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Bruce-Jenner-Becoming-a-Woman.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">A member of the latest designated victim group, who became Vanity Fair’s “cover girl” and Glamour’s “Woman of the Year”.</p>
</div>
<p>Typically, feminists have <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116161/3-feminists-who-caused-the-most-harm-to-the-world" target="_blank">severe problems</a> coming to terms with basic biology. Some can’t comprehend that humans are sexually dimorphic (like all advanced species); others do get it but believe this is unjust somehow. Strangely, there are even those who take the side of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75405/a-modern-day-horror-story-on-the-origin-of-the-transgender-movement" target="_blank">delusional men</a> who think they’re women.</p>
<p>Feminists smart enough to know what a woman is are called “trans-exclusionary radical feminists” (TERFs) by those who are clueless about basic biology, or who believe reality conforms to our wishes. Note also that actual lesbians don’t bang men who think they’re women—I wonder why? Back in 1979, Janice G. Raymond wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>All transsexuals rape women’s bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here we have an early example of the “everything we don’t like is some kind of rape” trope. (Must they keep trivializing this loathsome felony?) To be more accurate about it, trannies are neurotic men mutilating their own bodies; trying to become something they’re not.</p>
<p>Gloria Steinem objected to transsexuality back in the days when she was a little more sensible and personable. In 2013, when questioned about it, she flip-flopped. Had she reasserted her former views, she would have received torrents of criticism from those who once regarded her as a heroine. Whenever the collective hive-mind decides something, anyone who dissents is in danger of attack. The “TERF wars” get pretty heated indeed. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/29/transgenderism-hate-speech" target="_blank">Sheila Jeffreys noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever the topic of my presentation, and whether in Australia, the UK or the US, transgender activists bombard the organising group and the venue with emails accusing me of transhate, transphobia, hate speech, and seek to have me banned. On blogs, Facebook and Twitter they accuse me of wanting to “eliminate” transgendered persons, and they wish me dead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like some <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-a-social-justice-warrior-sjw" target="_blank">Social Justice Warriors</a> got triggered there. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/68757/why-are-canadian-feminists-so-desperately-trying-to-shut-down-rooshs-speeches" target="_blank">We understand</a>, Sheila. SJWs get <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95868/the-delusional-reality-of-social-justice-warriors-is-a-form-of-mental-illness" target="_blank">pretty kooky</a> indeed. As we shall see, they’ve ventured into some strange new territories.</p>

<h4>Palestinians versus Israelis</h4>

</div>
<p>Israel has treated the Palestinians pretty badly; many leftists have noticed, considering them an oppressed group. As indelicate as it might be to mention, a disproportionate number of leading leftist figures—<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62716/the-damaging-effects-of-jewish-intellectualism-and-activism-on-western-culture" target="_blank">past and present</a>—are Jewish. Occasionally this makes for a pretty sour note.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there is a small overlap between pro-Palestinian activists and left-leaning Jews, with interesting results. Sometimes it’s principled, but not always. For example, <a href="http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/2015/6/2/gilad-atzmon-explains-the-subversion-of-the-pro-palestine-cause-by-the-jewish-left" target="_blank">Gilad Atzmon described</a> how entryism led to parts of the Palestinian movement becoming a watered-down controlled opposition, a proxy in a conflict between differing Israeli interests. Further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last six decades the working people have been plundered repeatedly. The people who used to be called the working class are now the workless class, and many of them are underclass by now. But why?</p>
<p>Unlike the (imaginary) “old good labor-oriented Left” that promised to unite us all against capital and the Empire, the neo-Marxists and the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/90815/how-the-cultural-marxists-of-the-frankfurt-school-subverted-education" target="_blank">Frankfurt Yeshiva</a> enthusiasts invested a huge effort breaking the cohesiveness of the working people and Western society in general.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t have a dog in the Palestinian-Israeli fight, but it’s refreshing to hear some straight talk for once. He goes further describing the effects of the Palestinian movement being shoehorned into the “social justice” tar-ball, and concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the liberal Zionist George Soros’s Open Society funded a <a href="http://www.gilad.co.uk/writings/israelpalestine-and-the-queer-international-a-book-review-by.html" target="_blank">BDS LGBT tour in America</a>, young Hamas engineers were digging tunnels and building rockets in Gaza. I am convinced that Palestinian Muslim leaders in Gaza grasped at a certain stage that the struggle for Palestinian queer politics may not be the definitive path toward Palestinian liberation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is that a recipe for unity and solidarity? Those who are genuinely concerned about the Palestinian situation are right to be annoyed that their movement has been co-opted. It goes both ways too; <a href="http://pamelageller.com/category/adl/" target="_blank">Jewisn NGOs</a> can get infiltrated by pro-Palestinian elements. Still, this has spilled far beyond the Levantine misunderstanding. As the legend goes, the golem turns against its creator.</p>
<h4>Muslims and their enablers versus Jews</h4>
<div id="attachment_57561" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-57561" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/behead-those-who-insult-islam-300x145.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="242" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/behead-those-who-insult-islam-300x145.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/behead-those-who-insult-islam-262x127.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/behead-those-who-insult-islam-574x278.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/behead-those-who-insult-islam.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Res ipse loquitur.</p>

<p>Privilege rhetoric is the great yardstick of “social justice” arguments; whichever group is deemed most privileged is considered wrong, regardless of actual facts. Some leftists have drawn conclusions about Jewish wealth and influence in politics, and past persecutions only go so far to offset this picture. Privilege rhetoric led to anti-White sentiment (as designed). However, it turned into anti-Semitism too, and has the potential to get much worse. Today, many SJWs are <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/57090/the-newfound-alliance-between-feminism-marxism-and-radical-islam" target="_blank">in bed with radical Islam</a>, despite Muslim fundamentalism <em>opposing just about everything</em> that liberalism is supposed to stand for: pacifism, religious tolerance, women’s rights, GLBT interests, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>This “social justice” stuff is a recent development of cultural Marxism. That in turn got started by the Frankfurt School, a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114104/what-is-cultural-marxism" target="_blank">Communist revolutionary dream team</a> of professors and psychologists, and <a href="http://www.kevinmacdonald.net/chap5.pdf" target="_blank">almost all of them</a> were Jewish. Well, that’s a little embarrassing! Their actions besmirched their community’s reputation, destabilized the countries where they prospered, and ultimately gave their opponents rhetorical ammunition.</p>
<p>This caused considerable blowback, an error continuing today. Worse, Jewish elites and their supporters <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-09-27/george-soros-demands-eu-accept-1-million-refugees-costing-%E2%82%AC15-billion-year-foreseeab" target="_blank">have been pushing</a> for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jl-OJJVAEg&amp;list=PLf7RBTKWTobAjJaNZyZJSBVq5AnO_jxO-" target="_blank">mass immigration</a> into Europe and the USA. Not only do the common citizens suffer, the Jewish community themselves have experienced a great deal of anti-Semitism from Muslim new arrivals.</p>
<p>Really, elites of all backgrounds need to knock it off with their <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95710/how-a-small-cabal-is-using-socialism-cultural-marxism-to-consolidate-world-power" target="_blank">social engineering</a>, or they’re going to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/112252/the-elites-have-no-idea-what-is-coming" target="_blank">go down with the ship</a>. And speaking of population displacement…</p>
<h4>Urban turf wars in the USA</h4>
<div id="attachment_84763" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-84763" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit-768x512.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit-574x383.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/detroit.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Detroit was once a bustling industrial center, considered the city of the future.</p>

<p>The struggle for control over neighborhoods is quite a long one, and is still ongoing. In the 1950s, Blacks began flooding into many new neighborhoods. After that, Whites left, selling their homes at a loss. Many real estate scamsters encouraged this and turned a tidy profit from “block busting”. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/08/09/hud-proposes-plan-to-racially-economically-integrate-neighborhoods" target="_blank">Government meddling</a> and <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/12/national-review-white-working-class-communities-morally-indefensible-they-deserve-to-die/" target="_blank">outright hostility</a> by <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98814/todays-mainstream-conservatives-only-serve-the-globalist-establishment" target="_blank">neocons</a> have made it worse. Sure, the residents could choose to stay, but by the 1960s the ghettos were no longer the safe places they used to be, and the schools weren’t looking too good either. To a degree, ghettos are still “no go zones” for outsiders.</p>
<p>More recently, it goes the other direction too. Developers buy up land in the ghettos, get the property taxes jacked up, and the residents can’t afford to stay. The houses are bulldozed to put up McMansions and condos for trendy <em>haut-bourgeois</em> types and hipsters. Thus, one left-leaning demographic displaces another. Urban gentrification has become a big sore point. Blacks don’t like being displaced by yuppies and urban elves any more than the Whites liked being forced into the suburbs.</p>
<p>Conflicts between minority groups are also on the rise. This featured during the Los Angeles riots, where Korean-owned stores got looted and burnt, I guess for the hell of it. Lately for Los Angeles, Hispanics are <a href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2013/02/more-on-the-latino-black-war-in-los-angeles/" target="_blank">ethnically cleansing</a> Blacks out of neighborhoods they’d been in for <a href="http://www.africanamerica.org/topic/latinos-ethnic-cleansing-african-americans-in-la" target="_blank">quite some time</a>. Competition for jobs is also an issue. With a rising Hispanic population, things could get interesting. People promoting multiculturalism as the neatest thing since sliced bread don’t realize that more cultures inside a country means <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/89441/there-is-little-difference-between-immigrants-and-invaders" target="_blank">more conflicts</a>.</p>
