<p>A huge part that helped me break free of the <a href="https://www.returnofkings.com/113870/3-ways-to-make-money-online-id-stay-away-from" target="_blank">corporate grind</a> was having a large stash (&gt;500,000) airline miles saved. Knowing that I could get around the world for free as opposed to paying for $1,000 flights made the jump a lot less scary.</p>
<p>Here are five things you probably do in your day to day life that could easily help you stash some miles.</p>
<h4>1. Eating Out</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118422" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eo.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="360" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eo.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eo-300x216.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/eo-262x189.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>You eat out, right? How do you usually pay for it?</p>
<p>If your answer is cash, you’re doing it wrong. (There are exceptions to this: on a date with a girl. Don’t let the time it takes to use a credit card ruin the vibe.) Plenty of airline cards allow you 2 or 3x points for every dollar spent.</p>
<p>Spending $100 at a restaurant would equate to 300 points. Most of my one way tickets from California to <a href="https://ukraineliving.com/pretty-ukrainian-ladies/" target="_blank">Eastern Europe</a> cost me about 20,000. As you can see, that would add up fast if you spend $100 a week eating out. And that $100 is probably not far off what your average person DOES spend in a week.</p>
<h4>2. Buying Clothes</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118423" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="250" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes.jpg 980w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes-300x150.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes-768x384.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes-837x419.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes-667x334.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes-262x131.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/clothes-574x287.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>No matter if you buy from Amazon or a fancy retailer, many cards offer bonuses. Sometimes they do online promotions through their portals.</p>
<p>Can you imagine earning points with a 10x multiplier when buying shoes—things you need anyway?</p>
<p>The point is, if you’re looking for a new watch or new kicks—you can probably maximize it to ways you couldn’t imagine.</p>
<h4>3. Paying Rent</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118424" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-1200x799.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-1200x799.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-768x512.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-667x444.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent-574x382.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/rent.jpg 1240w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Many apartment landlords now have credit card payment processors online. That’s a very easy way to hit the lucrative bonuses that credit cards offer (it’s usually spend $2-3k in 3 months and get 30-50k points)</p>
<p>If your apartment costs $1,000 a month, you could get 50,000 points just by using a credit card. That’s a round trip plus a bit more to almost everywhere in the world from the continental US. If your landlord doesn’t, consider using a service that does. You’ll pay a 2-3% fee, but in our example that’s only $30. For three months it would cost you $90. You might ask if it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Is a round trip ticket from <a href="https://thisistrouble.com/2017/02/07/spanish-women/" target="_blank">Spain worth more than $90?</a> <em>There’s</em> your answer.</p>
<p><strong>PS:</strong> If you live mostly out of AirBNBs as a nomad, you get 2 or 3x the cost of the apartment by using a travel credit card.</p>
<h4>4. Paid Dating Sites (*Sometimes*)</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118425" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-1200x675.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-1200x675.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-768x432.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dating-site-574x323.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script data-cfasync="false" src="cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<p>Certain dating sites have huge promotions that they sometimes run with airlines. Recently, Match.com did a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>150x</strong></span> points promotion with British Airways. That means if you signed up for a month of that dating site at $70, you’d have earned over 10,000 miles. The jury is still out whether or not British Airways and Match.com actually honor this over the long-term. There’s been doubts about it.</p>
<p>While a 150x promotion is definitely not the norm, there are typically offers that are quite good. Some of these premium, <a href="https://www.returnofkings.com/117353/5-thoughts-about-online-dating-in-2017" target="_blank">paid dating sites</a> are worth looking at <em>once in a while.</em> The usual problem with them is that they don’t have enough members to justify the cost. But, there are enough members that signing up every three months is worth it.</p>
<p>And even more so if you can get a free flight or two out of it.</p>
<h4>5. Office And Household Supplies</h4>
<p>This is especially true to you guys who run businesses, especially true if it’s of the <a href="https://www.returnofkings.com/111233/5-lessons-i-learned-moving-from-offline-to-online-business" target="_blank">brick and mortar type.</a></p>
<p>Because most small businesses spend a small fortune in office supplies. Pens, paper, and other organization materials. Quite a few of the very good credit cards offer 5x on these purchases. A business that spent a measly $1k a month on office supplies (nothing in the scheme of things) could easily net 5k points.</p>
<p>Home improvement type stores often run great specials on points, too—2 or 3x. If you’ve got a home project that’s going to cost a few grand, those points add up quick.</p>
<p>Do that for a year and again—you’re flying round-trip just about anywhere in the world. <a href="https://speakingabroad.com/rocket-japanese-review/" target="_blank">Always wanted to see Japan?</a> Great, now you can just from buying printer ink. <em>Crazy</em>.</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118419" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kotor.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kotor.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kotor-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kotor-667x500.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kotor-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kotor-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>There are a lot of other ways to go about this, but you’ll notice I’ve left <em>all</em> the bells and whistles off this list; i.e. some of the really absurd and crazy ways to rack up miles. <strong>That’s for a reason.</strong></p>
<p>I’m of the belief that you should use these kind of “life hacks” as a way to help yourself get ahead, but not let it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">define</span> you. There’s little point in spending countless hours a week researching every in and out of the miles and points came so that you can get a few extra <em>cents</em> worth of miles.</p>
<p>It’s the same as the crazy nuts who show up to the cash register with 100 coupons in their hand.</p>
<p>You’re better off developing a mindset of a winner. Make more money, and don’t pinch pennies. Don’t be the dude who goes to Thailand so he can live off of $1,200. Be the guy who goes to <a href="https://thisistrouble.com/2017/01/10/thai-women/" target="_blank">Thailand and makes $1,200 a day.</a></p>
<p>With that being said, some of these are incredibly easy to implement in your life. In fact, I would wager that for most of you, doing these things would add no more than a couple of hours a month to your schedule (probably not even that). And the results are tangible, real, and allow you to see the world. Combine a huge stash of miles with a modest online income can be a lethal combination.</p>
<p>The possibilities? Well, they’re endless.</p>
