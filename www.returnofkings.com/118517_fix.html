<p>The British government continues to march down the dark path of Cultural Marxism. Today, it’s ruled almost entirely by closet radical feminists that are determined to strike blow after blow against men and the family unit. Since 2010, Theresa May, formerly the head of the Home office and now the unelected Prime Minister, and Alison Saunders, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), have changed the laws so that women’s claims of abuse and victimization at the hands of men are always assumed true by the police. Men can be arrested and held in custody for 24 hours without being told why. Women’s statements alone can deny a man the right to see his children. There are no definitive civil rights guarantees for men given the family courts’ right to determine what is considered to be a threat to a woman or the family. The Crown Prosecution Service has a de-facto policy of prosecuting all allegations made by women against men, without proper regard to their plausibility.</p>

<p>This newfound power that hijacks the legal system and overrides due process and fundamental human rights gives women the ability to make false claims and exert extreme leverage over men for any reason they choose. Many men are having their lives ruined before they have had a chance to prove their innocence. We have all seen the news stories about the actions and policies of the Home Office, the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service since 2010, when Theresa May and Alison Saunders took over and applied radical feminist policies. Absurd allegations of rape, domestic violence, and discrimination ruined the lives of men, and many of these allegations were later proven to be false or exaggerated beyond recognition.</p>

<p>This problem, regrettably, will get worse. As unelected Prime Minister, Theresa May will increase her assault on human rights for men – she wants to repeal the Human Rights Act, which provides human rights for all, but retain the Equality Act 2010, which de-facto defends human rights for women and protected minorities. The net result will be that only men lose their human rights. She will increase state surveillance of men – she has driven through passage of the Investigatory Powers Act, which retains 12 months of your website data and makes it available to local police forces and social services without a warrant.</p>

<p>She will continue her doublespeak – a prime example is Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG), which is a set of male-hate policies using the front of domestic abuse for criminalising men and putting hundreds millions of pounds annually into the pockets of feminists. She will intensify politicised justice – for example, she appointed feminist Liz Truss as Justice Secretary despite her complete lack of legal experience. She will fuel the gender war through lies and statistics – she manipulates facts, e.g. she defines gender pay gap as the difference between the median salary of men vs the median salary of women without adjusting for line of work, seniority, experience, education, hours worked, performance, time spent away from home, risky working environment, etc.. No economist takes this fabricated gender wage gap seriously.</p>
<p>Feminism isn’t about equal rights for women. It’s about criminalising, humiliating and emasculating men. It is about taking everything men have worked for – their homes, families and careers, away from them at any opportunity. Protect yourself.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>1. Recognise that women have become weaponised</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">T</span><span style="color: #000000;">he world has changed.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Since 2010, new laws, amended laws and new application of old laws have radically widened the definitions of domestic abuse, sexual assault, discrimination, harassment, stalking, and hate crime to such an extent that just about anything a man does can now be classed as a crime.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Subjective interpretation is a key enabling feature.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Under Home Office guidance, the police must now accept everything a woman says, believe everything a woman says and check very little.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">All female complainants are referred to as “victims.”</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Under the 2014 Positive Action Policy of the police YOU WILL be arrested. Under the Zero Tolerance policies of the Home Office and Alison Saunders at the Crown Prosecution Service YOU WILL be prosecuted.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">YOU WILL be treated as guilty until proven innocent and YOU WILL have to prove your innocence.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Women have not been empowered.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">They have become unwittingly weaponised by feminists to destroy men and families.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">They want women to hate the ones they love. Feminists and vindictive psychos like to pull the trigger.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>2. Shun feminists and psychos</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Avoid feminists, whether or not they’re married.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">A false or exaggerated claim can be made by any woman against any man and feminists are far more likely than non-feminists to do this. Avoid women who have degrees in gender studies, use the word “victim,” or think the solution to their problems is to report pettiness to the police (or anyone for that matter).</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Assume all women are feminists until proven to be anti-feminists.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Vindictive psychos are more difficult to avoid – you never know until it’s too late.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Men have always had to deal with psychos, usually by gently walking away, but these days they can come back with a vengeance with false claims and with the police and CPS by their side.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Try screening them out by only proceeding with dating if they sign a statutory declaration under penalty of perjury that they have never made an allegation of rape, harassment, stalking, domestic abuse, bullying or trolling.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">You can both sign one to be fair about it.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Never have sex with them if they’ve had more than two drinks – they lack legal capacity to consent and they or their feminist friend can later accuse you of rape (but they will still be held legally responsible if they drive drunk).</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>3. Insure yourself against false accusations</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are a man and falsely accused and charged by the police or the CPS you will need money to defend yourself. Check your home insurance, which may cover legal defence.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Alternatively, keep £20,000 in a bank account as a legal defence fund. This account cannot be a joint account and your partner must be unaware of its existence.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">The British justice system de-facto presumes men are guilty until proven innocent and innocence may be expensive to prove.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>4. Protect yourself with technology</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Theresa May drove through the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, which compels all ISPs to log every website you and your family have visited over the past 12 months and make this information available to local police and social workers without warrant.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">She claims this is to fight terrorism but she will re-purpose it to fight men.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Fight back. Encrypt all of your hard drives.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Use VPNs for your internet connection.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Send messages only on encrypted platforms such as WhatsApp and iMessage.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Keep every message and email a woman has ever sent to you and record any sexual activity.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">You will need this in court to prove your innocence.</span></p>

<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>5. Stick together as a family</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Family breakdown in the </span><span style="color: #000000;">UK</span><span style="color: #000000;"> is now the highest in </span><span style="color: #000000;">Europe</span><span style="color: #000000;"> thanks to state policy and the court system.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">You, your wife and your children are the best defence against a male-hating, family-hating state.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Be united in your defence of your children, your property, your religion and your family values against the state’s attack on families.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Spend time with your family building love and trust with each other.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Stick up for one another.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>6. Distrust police and civil servants</b>  </span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Meet them with a wall of silence.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Teach your children NEVER to speak to these people without you or a solicitor present.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">This is especially true for your teenage or older boys. Don’t be naïve – NHS staff and state school teachers are now social services informants.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">20% of all children in the </span><span style="color: #000000;">UK</span><span style="color: #000000;"> under the age of five have been reported to social services. Don’t engage in conversation – tell them the minimum information needed to conclude whatever transaction it is you have with them.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Do not cooperate with the police, especially the Community Service Unit (the relationship police).</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">They will lie, twist and exaggerate to create a case against you. Video or voice record every conversation or encounter you have with the police, social services, parking wardens, NHS staff or any other state worker. Your iPhone is your best weapon and your best defence.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>7. Embrace women with strong father figures and common sense</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">If you are single, seek out women who admire their fathers and brothers. Find those who have experienced real life, who have known hardship, who grew up in well-adjusted social households with fathers and brothers. Seek women who know life is filled with ups and downs.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Do not date women who demonstrate a sense of entitlement, victimization or extreme emotional instability. Be particularly aware of women who threaten you when jealous or make up or exaggerate stories about other men they have dated. Reduce your risk by vetting all women you date with a background check, searches on their social media websites such as Facebook, questions about previous relationships and how they ended.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">If necessary, hire a private detective to ensure they don’t have a record of making false or petty allegations against previous partners.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>8. Avoid non-committal Northern European, British, and American women</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Two-thirds of divorces in the </span><span style="color: #000000;">US</span><span style="color: #000000;"> and </span><span style="color: #000000;">UK</span><span style="color: #000000;">are now initiated by women, not men. Domestic violence allegations is their weapon of choice in getting custody of your children and your money.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Don’t be conned by these feminist-inspired women.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Date family-orientated women. Sign prenuptial agreements with a view to keeping your wife honest through sickness and in health, but be aware that British courts are not currently legally bound by these agreements.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span style="color: #000000;">9. Minimise your taxes</span></b></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">75% of income tax in the </span><span style="color: #000000;">UK</span><span style="color: #000000;"> is paid by men.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">This is in addition to spousal support and child support payments paid by men, many of whom are blocked by state bodies such as CAFCASS or the family courts from seeing their children.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Taxes paid by men are then used against them by a feminist-controlled state to fund its war against men and families. Tax is theft. </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">Practice legal tax avoidance and stop funding the state’s war on men.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>10. Stay out of the system</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">State schools are failing boys.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Boys now make up only 40% of university students.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">The heavily feminised state education system is hostile to boys and teaches feminism and political correctness, not critical thinking.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Normal boy behaviour is no longer tolerated and is often classed as ADHD.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">So is Dad Deficit Disorder. Ritalin and Concerta prescriptions for boys are at an all-time high.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Send your children to private school if you can.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>11. Ditch your TV license and stop funding the BBC</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Broadcast television media, most notably the BBC, have become rabidly anti-male.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Men are depicted as bumbling idiots and worse. There are almost no male news presenters anymore.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Witness </span><i><span style="color: #000000;">Women’s Hour (Women Sour)</span></i><span style="color: #000000;"> on BBC radio.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Declare you do not watch live TV and stop paying your TV Licence.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">You can still stream Netflix and watch DVDs.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Your mental health will improve tenfold.</span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
<h4><b><span style="color: #000000;">12. Be resilient</span></b></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Suicide is now the leading cause of death of males aged between 15-49 in the </span><span style="color: #000000;">UK</span><span style="color: #000000;">.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Men are killing themselves at a rate more than three times higher than women.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">When a man loses his children, his family and his rights in a system stacked against him it is easy to lose all hope.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Be resilient.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>13. Be great at what you do</b></span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Don’t let the feminists drag you down. Be great at your sport, your business, your intellectual pursuits, or whatever it is you choose to do.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Men have a unique ability to compartmentalise and focus without distraction on achieving success.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Don’t let feminists stop you.</span><a name="m_-1353231576260547836__GoBack"></a></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>14. Stay human</b>  </span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Don’t turn into a politically-correct male automaton.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Don’t shut down your emotions, your masculinity or your sex drive.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Simply find safe locations and trusted friends to express your humanity.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Exercise every day.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Men especially need it.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Feel the testosterone and endorphins.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Be physically alive.</span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;"><b>15. Fight back and defend your rights</b>  </span></h4>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Most men in the </span><span style="color: #000000;">UK</span><span style="color: #000000;"> are unaware of how their rights have been assaulted by the state’s actions and changed over the past years. Get informed and stay informed. Know your rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. Exercise and stand up for your rights and family values.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Recognise the laws are wrong, Police and CPS application of the law is wrong and the justice system has become politicised.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Engage in non-violent civil disobedience.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Rational debate and free speech no longer exist.</span><span style="color: #000000;">  </span><span style="color: #000000;">Be prepared to risk getting arrested.</span></p>
