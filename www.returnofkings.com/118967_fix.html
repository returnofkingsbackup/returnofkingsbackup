<p>Men search the world for women that they can stand to be around with long-term. Narcissism, androgyny, obsession with pop culture—the problems with Western women go on and on.</p>
<p>Is there some place, a secluded land untouched by time, where women still make good wives?</p>
<p>Mormons are one of the few remaining groups with healthy women. Because Mormons retain old-fashioned values, Mormon girls are raised in a traditional environment by good fathers. They value femininity, motherhood, and masculinity in men. This makes them overwhelmingly successful wives and mothers.</p>
<h4>How To Approach Mormon Girls</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28051" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/GirlTextingOnCellPhone.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="300"></p>
<p>Where do you find Mormon girls? Not Starbucks but at traditional venues, like bowling and movies. Lok for certain things: sleeved shirts, a subdued character, long pants or dresses, and different mannerisms. Spend some time with a few and you will know what to look for.</p>
<p>Cold approaches on Mormon girls are challenging. She will be happy to chat with you, but unless you are Mormon yourself or make a huge impression, you won’t get her number. Overt sexuality and teasing are too much, due to Mormon girls’ high insecurity. But daytime game is the key. The standard principles of day game apply.</p>
<p>These girls are nervous around non-Mormons. Seclusion has served to preserve their desirable traits, but it also makes it difficult to gain rapport. A grandpa sense of humor and occasional clever line from an old movie go a long way. In many ways, these girls are stuck in the 1950’s.</p>
<p>Something that will help you stand out is a strong masculine frame. Be open and talk about your ideals. She will be surprised that a non-Mormon holds the same values she does and respect you.</p>
<p>Mormons have separate congregations for young single adults, which is very convenient. This is why you don’t see many 18-30 year olds in typical LDS congregations. But it is luck of the draw. A “single’s ward” may be full of great girls or totally empty. Single’s wards also become filled with weak guys, so a unique masculine impression and well-dressed presentation really stand out.</p>
<h4>Social Awkwardness</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-24124" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Girl-2.jpg" alt="" width="473" height="295"></p>
<p>Many Mormons stick to a small group of friends within the church. At parties, they drink soda and play board games. Their values and the values of popular western culture are wildly disparate, which can be tough for them to navigate early in life. This lack of inclusion within the general society makes them socially awkward, especially around men.</p>
<p>I didn’t date Mormon girls for a long time because of their social awkwardness, even though I am Mormon myself. Then I discovered that Mormons were a welcome exception to the degeneracy that pervades American women. As I grew and became confident, I learned how to deal with social awkwardness.</p>
<p>It is tempting for Mormon girls to become lazy because they have such a high standard compared to typical girls. They know that they are the best. Imagine if all the men in the world weighed over 300 pounds and acted like slobs. How would that motivate you to work out every day to get a girl?</p>
<p>Some Mormon girls succumb to worldly laziness. I knew a Mormon girl who got rides from her Mormon friends for casual sex dates with men she met on Tinder.</p>
<p>Other lazy Mormon girls turn feminist, many thousands of them. The Mormon university BYU is quickly falling due to these feminists. BYU was once the perfect place to find a great young woman and get married. But those days may be gone. The pressure is mounting for Mormon women to cave in to Western degeneracy, and men are at a loss for what to do about it.</p>
<p>With such high standards of perfection, Mormon girls want a man who validates their efforts and confidently provides direction—a man who expects them to be beautiful. They want a man who has navigated the stormy seas of the world, who has just a little bit of history, and has overcome the degenerate worldly culture, a man who has discovered for himself where peace and happiness lie.</p>
<h4>Be A Patriarchal Leader</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118970" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nephi.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nephi.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nephi-300x180.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/nephi-262x157.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Since a very young age, these girls have gazed at handsome paintings of Jesus and prophets, and learned to respect men who have spiritual confidence in their eyes. They were taught that bold sincerity of purpose and a charitable attitude is what makes a man.</p>
<p>I knew a guy who joined the Mormon church because he thought it would help him date a certain Mormon girl, a girl who refused to date non-Mormons. This guy was orbiting so strongly that he changed his religion before they were even dating! Then the girl decided still not to date him after all. I wasn’t surprised.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t become Mormon, you can become desirable to the girls with spiritual leadership and confidence. Patriarchal leadership is something that most women in the world valued until recently, but it is still a chief value with Mormons. She wants the captain of a ship who can direct all aspects of a relationship, including spiritual direction.</p>
<p>What made the patriarchs of the Old Testament—Abraham, Isaac, Jacob—masculine?</p>
<p>Propagandists in the media throw around the word <em>patriarchy</em> as if it is synonymous with anything male. But what does it really mean to be a patriarch, to lead your tribe? In Mormon theology, leadership as a man takes you directly to godhood. She views patriarchy as a quality of God.</p>

<h4>Princess Syndrome</h4>
<p><img class="wp-image-96633" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White.jpg" alt="" width="465" height="348" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White.jpg 900w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White-768x575.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White-837x627.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White-667x500.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White-262x196.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Fallen_Snow_White-574x430.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"></p>
<p>Mormon girls are taught that they have a divine nature. There is a heavenly Mother as well as a Father, though we don’t know anything about her—Heavenly Father is the one we worship. In the Garden of Eden, Eve may have introduced sin into the world, but ultimately her actions worked out for good because it allowed all of us to be born and tested in this telestial state. Such beliefs make the girls confident about being women.</p>
<p>Typical American girls have the government to make them feel secure. They have heavy-handed laws, free handouts, unfair advantages for getting jobs—a loud feminist illusion spoon fed to them.</p>
<p>Due to their seclusion from popular culture, Mormon girls don’t have all this. They therefore have a high standard to work toward. They are stuck with a woman’s natural state of insecurity.</p>
<p>This insecurity is at the root of the princess syndrome. With so much pervasive degeneracy in the media, Mormon parents think they are safe showing their kids Disney movies. Unfortunately, this has led to a culture of Mormon girls who are absolutely obsessed with Disney and even as adults dream of being Disney princesses.</p>
<p>Disney gives them the fantasy where they can easily achieve a standard of perfection with low risk. Girls then struggle to reconcile degenerate popular culture with Mormon expectations. It will be up to you, her man, to support the positive expectations.</p>
<p>Many Mormon girls place the cart before the horse. They talk about having an idealistic family but don’t consider how to make it happen. As the patriarchal leader, it will be up to you to figure it out and to dispel her unrealistic fantasies. You will have to bring her down to reality.</p>
<h4>Nurture Her Virtues</h4>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-76543" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/motherhood.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="262" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/motherhood.jpg 282w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/motherhood-262x243.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px"></p>
<p>Usually, when Mormon girls marry non-Mormon men, these women forsake their religion and revert to ordinary American woman. It is like Cinderella’s carriage which transforms back to a normal pumpkin at the stroke of midnight. After twenty years, her behavior will be on the same level as any above-average American woman.</p>
<p>This is because they gave up the structure of what made them desirable in the first place. Those things don’t last if they aren’t nurtured.</p>
<p>I know a non-Mormon guy who married a Mormon woman and has kept her beautiful and desirable, by encouraging her religious involvement, even though he avoided Mormonism himself. He led the family as patriarch and actively supported his children’s spiritual growth.</p>
<p>This can be done. Mormon women greatly value sincerity of purpose. Beyond religious structure, it is important to recognize the peculiarities that make the Mormon women special or not special, and to encourage their growth.</p>
<p>One red flag I have for Mormon girls is if they drink coffee. It seems like a minor point, but I have noticed that every Mormon girl who disobeys the Mormon direction to avoid coffee has something majorly wrong with her. It would be foolish to acquiesce a Mormon girl to drink coffee. That would only encourage her to give up other standards that really are serious and to become like the typical Western degenerate.</p>
<p>As for her beliefs, the history of polygamy makes it easy for Leftists and feminists to weave sick sex fantasies into their narrative about Mormons. Mormon theology is peculiar, yes, but the media frequently takes things out of context and misrepresents the religion. Maybe there is wisdom behind some of the peculiarities.</p>
<h4>Neomasculinity Works</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-28509" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Suit-Beard.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>Not long ago, I came across Roosh’s program for self-improvement and decided to apply it to myself. I also studied his advice for approaching and dating women.</p>
<p>I was skeptical whether this would work with Mormon girls– sheltered girls who would never step inside a dance club or be wooed by pickup artists. But what I discovered surprised me. I found that it worked just as well.</p>
<p>Game isn’t really taught in the Mormon community, and I think this has led to weaker and more unsuccessful men. This opens opportunities for all strong and successful masculine men to gain access to these women. Mormon girls are thirsting for strong, confident, masculine men.</p>
<p>I was not surprised to see Return Of Kings explore personal virtue with the neomasculinity movement. Patriarchal attributes are best for gaming women, so it is natural that this effort lead to other traditional principles of men’s success.</p>
<p>These same principles have helped build strong, successful religious communities for thousands of years. Masculine attributes attract healthy, beautiful women, no matter where they come from. It is fundamental that we focus foremost on developing ourselves as suitably strong men.</p>
