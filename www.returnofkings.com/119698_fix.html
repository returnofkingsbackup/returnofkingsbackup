<p>Andrew Anglin, publisher of far-right site Daily Stormer, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/04/18/splc-sues-neo-nazi-leader-who-targeted-jewish-woman-anti-semitic-harassment-campaign">has been sued in Federal Court today for $300,000</a>, stemming from his reporting about Tanya Gersh, a Montana real estate agent who he accused of attempting to extort Richard Spencer’s mother into selling a Whitefish, Montana property. In the lawsuit, Anglin is accused of creating a “troll storm” against Gersh that caused her emotional distress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Here is the announcement <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/news/2017/04/18/splc-sues-neo-nazi-leader-who-targeted-jewish-woman-anti-semitic-harassment-campaign">from the SPLC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, along with its Montana co-counsel, filed suit in federal court today against the founder of a major neo-Nazi website who orchestrated a harassment campaign that has relentlessly terrorized a Jewish woman and her family with anti-Semitic threats and messages.</p>
<p>The lawsuit describes how Andrew Anglin used his web forum, the Daily Stormer – the leading extremist website in the country – to publish 30 articles urging his followers to launch a “troll storm” against Tanya Gersh, a real estate agent in Whitefish, Montana. Gersh, her husband and 12-year-old son have received more than 700 harassing messages since December.</p>
<p>The intimidation began after Anglin accused Gersh of attempting to extort money from the mother of Richard Spencer. The younger Spencer heads the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist organization.</p>
<p>Anglin and Spencer are both prominent leaders of the “alt-right” movement that rallied white nationalists behind President Donald Trump’s campaign.</p>
<p>“Andrew Anglin knew he had an online army primed to attack with the click of a mouse,” said SPLC President Richard Cohen. “We intend to hold him accountable for the suffering he has caused Ms. Gersh and to send a strong message to those who use their online platforms as weapons of intimidation.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, Missoula Division, seeks compensatory and punitive damages. It accuses Anglin of invading Gersh’s privacy and intentionally inflicting emotional distress. It also outlines how his campaign violated the Montana Anti-Intimidation Act.</p>

<p>Richard Spencer’s mom described in a blog post <a href="https://medium.com/@recnepss/does-love-really-live-here-fff159563ba3">how Gersh pressured her to sell her property</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had no intention of selling . . . until I started receiving terrible threats in the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p>These threats came from Tanya Gersh, a local realtor with links to “human rights” organizations Love Lives Here and the Montana Human Rights Network.</p>

<p>On November 22, Gersh and I spoke on the phone. She relayed to me that if I did not sell my building, 200 protesters and national media would show up outside — which would drive down the property value — until I complied. Gersh’s other conditions included that I make a public denunciation of my son in a statement written by the Montana Human Rights Network and that I make a donation to this organization from the sale of the property. As Gersh announced on Facebook, she was “spear heading” the campaign.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anglin <a href="http://www.dailystormer.com/jews-targeting-richard-spencers-mother-for-harassment-and-extortion-take-action/">urged his readers to “take action” against Gersh</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So Then – Let’s Hit Em Up</p>
<p>Are y’all ready for an old fashioned Troll Storm?</p>
<p>Because AYO – it’s that time, fam.</p>
<p>And as always: NO VIOLENCE OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THAT.</p>
<p>Just make your opinions known. Tell them you are sickened by their Jew agenda to attack and harm the mother of someone whom they disagree with.</p>
<p>First things first: the Jew terrorist group Love Lives Here.</p>
<p>Please call them</p>
<p>Phone: [removed] (international callers add 001 to the beginning)</p>
<p>They also have a form you can fill with your complaints.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Please call her and tell her what you think. And hey – if you’re in the area, maybe you should stop by and tell her in person what you think of her actions,.</p>
<p>Address: [removed]</p>
<p>Phone: [removed]</p>
<p>You can also leave a review of her business on Google, and perhaps note that it is front for an extortion racket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anglin has not been charged with any crime against Gersh, meaning that this lawsuit may set a precedent where a site publisher is responsible for the behavior of his readers. Even if the lawsuit fails, defending against it will involve substantial amounts of money and have the intended effect of stifling Anglin’s speech. On the flip side, SJWs and leftists who engage in doxing and online harassment, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116703/academic-finds-84-serious-threats-of-violence-directed-at-roosh-and-return-of-kings-readers">as they have been prone to do against us</a>, may now be on the hook for their actions if the SPLC prevails.</p>
<p>As for prudent measures to protect yourself, I recommend not criticizing or speaking against individual Jews in the United States, who can reach out to multiple organizations with deep pockets. Jews are a privileged group that can not be criticized like heterosexual men or white people can by the media or organizations like the SPLC, <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2012/misogyny-sites">which came after me in 2012</a>. This lawsuit proves that even a middle class Jewish woman in the middle of Montana has the full backing of the powerful Jewish lobby—with tens of millions of dollars in the bank—to attack her enemies.</p>
