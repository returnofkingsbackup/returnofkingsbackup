<p>I remember my first girlfriend, but not so fondly. I dated her when I was 18 and 19 years old. She was the classic “LA girl”—whiny attitude, demanding, and overall just a bit psychotic. I’ll never forget how she used to put little gold stars in my calendar on nights that she would “gift” me with some action (after the flames died out after the first few months).</p>
<p>Thankfully, I’ve come a long way since those days and can look back and chuckle. But that’s not the point of this article. When I was reading Roosh’s latest article about how it’s <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-documentary-hot-girls-wanted-shows-the-destructiveness-of-porn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">perfectly normal and acceptable for girls to do porn</a> now, I remembered her <em>friend.</em></p>
<p>I came to know her by “The Disneyland Bitch”. Let me tell you why.</p>
<h4>The Disneyland Marriage Proposal</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-120020" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/disneyland.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="374" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/disneyland.jpg 550w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/disneyland-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/disneyland-262x196.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></p>
<p>This friend of my girlfriend wanted to get married to her Prince Charming one day—if she ever found him. Of course, if poor bastard was “lucky” enough to find her, there were some absolutely insane requirements that he would have to meet before she agreed to take her hand in marriage.</p>
<p>Basically, she wanted her fairytale wedding, and fairytale <em>proposal</em>, too. In this case, the fairytale proposal was <em>quite literally required</em> to take place in front of the Disneyland castle. While my memory is a bit foggy, the general requirements for her to even consider his proposal were:</p>
<ul>
<li>The proposal MUST occur in front of the Disneyland castle.</li>
<li>It MUST be on a specific day of the summer (not coincidentally, when she would have the biggest audience of strangers to clap and cheer for her spectacle)—perhaps her birthday.</li>
<li>Her ENTIRE family had to be present—he was expected to foot the bill for all of them. This wasn’t just close family, either—she had a list of 20 aunts, cousins, and BFFs that HAD to be present.</li>
<li>The proposal must happen at night, at a specific moment in the fireworks/music cue.</li>
<li>He must have the proper arraignment of flowers and other gifts, in addition to the proper ring.</li>
<li>To top it off, she had actually <em>written a speech</em> for <em>her own proposal.</em> Apparently her father had it locked away. Upon the princess’ groom-to-be asking her father’s permission to propose, the father was supposed to inform the lucky guy of all these insane requirements, and give him the proposal speech (there were a few parts where he had creative freedom).</li>
</ul>
<p>If he did all of this, he might be <strong>lucky</strong> to get her consideration for marriage. Man, her father must be so proud to have raised such a strong and empowered woman—who is<em> </em>fearless with her demands! Meanwhile, <a href="https://thisistrouble.com/2017/04/20/southeast-asian-girls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southeast Asian girls won’t let you leave bed if you get sick.</a></p>
<p>Of course, any chump who falls for that spectacle deserves what’s coming to him. While I obviously don’t keep in touch with that girl as <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/97219/the-5-steps-to-running-a-modern-day-harem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I’ve more than moved on</a>, it occurred to me: <strong>is this now normal in America?</strong></p>
<h4>Expectations Start Young</h4>

<p>I’ve got enough young cousins who are still in high school, and let me tell you—<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114441/taking-the-red-pill-is-one-of-the-hardest-things-a-man-can-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">those poor guys don’t have it easy these days</a>. Just a few decades ago, a proposal was a private and special moment between man and woman. Now, as evidenced by the Disneyland Bitch, it’s become a public spectacle. A chance for women to show off to people who don’t matter. It’s all status—a way to garner Instagram likes and Facebook comments, just like traveling abroad to <a href="https://speakingabroad.com/is-portuguese-similar-to-spanish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">exotic locations.</a></p>
<p>That’s one thing—because the entire marriage industry is mostly just a spectacle, and has been for quite a while now. But have you seen how young men now are <em>expected </em>to ask a girl out to prom?</p>
<p>If you’re not in the loop, they’re now referred to as “Promposals”. Desperate high school boys now ride horses to school, make elaborate food concoctions, or do other silly stunts—all in the name of trying to get a girl to show some pity and go to prom with him (and maybe get to first base).</p>
<p>Remember when you had to try to <em>isolate</em> a girl to ask her out to prom? It was just the respectful, normal thing to do. It was a chance to share a moment of youth with someone whom you had a crush on. It was intimate in a PG way. In some ways, it was one of the <a href="https://ukraineliving.com/1-rule-ukrainian-first-dates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">final moments of youthful innocence</a> for both guys and girls.</p>
<p>These days? It’s just another stunt to make men into pussies, jumping through hoops for the insane demands of women. Let me tell you—the girl who gets a horse to get asked to prom is the same girl who is making demands like the Disneyland Bitch. You almost can’t blame her—she’s human. If the 18-year-old guy got her a horse for prom, surely a castle is within reason for a marriage proposal?</p>
<h4>What’s Next?</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-120031" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/desperate.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="290" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/desperate.jpg 800w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/desperate-300x174.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/desperate-768x446.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/desperate-667x388.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/desperate-262x152.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/desperate-574x334.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></p>
<p>Clearly, this cheesy, desperate begging is continuing to trend upward. From elaborate and expensive weddings that no one can afford, to proposals, and now all the way down to prom—the insanity continues.</p>
<p>The only question is—what comes next? Are young men in middle school (ages 12-14) going to have to start doing these kind of stunts to get girls to go to a dance with them? Eventually, the bubble is going to burst. The expectations are going to become so insane for girls, at such a young age, that no boy will <em>ever</em> be able to meet up to them.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting until much later in life to go their own way, young men in high school are going to say, “Enough is enough, I’m not going to bother.” <a href="https://thisistrouble.com/2017/03/16/date-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">At the absolute peak of their libidos</a>, they’re going to get so fed up with the entire process that porn will sound like a <strong>superior alternative.</strong></p>
<p>As Roosh detailed <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-documentary-hot-girls-wanted-shows-the-destructiveness-of-porn">in his article</a>—the girls will fly out of their small towns to do porn—all for a plane ticket and a few hundred bucks. They’ll spread their legs, get gang-banged, and dream of their elaborate proposals, while saying that they’re just “finding themselves”. They’ll say that it will make them a better person for their future husband.</p>
<p>And when no man is left to pick up the pieces, guess who will get the blame? You and I both know. The question is—do they?</p>
