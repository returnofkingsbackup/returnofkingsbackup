<p>In <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/113419/our-modern-marxist-world-how-a-cult-may-have-shaped-the-fate-of-western-civilization?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Part 2</a> we showed the satanic origins of our modern Western rulers and now we turn to the practical implementation of their ideas.</p>
<p><strong>In 1946 a document called “Rules for Communist Revolutionaries” was published in the US. </strong>In the document there are ten rules outlined on how to subvert western society and turn people into coarse, beast like, contentious and materialistic humans who are obsessed with trivial desires such as sports and pornography. The goal is to make them despise their own leaders and implement communist dictatorship as fast as possible while preaching democracy to the masses. Register all guns and then confiscate them. The real goal of the Marxists has always been turning upright, traditional men into wretches who have no idea about human life.</p>

<p><strong>Communist Rules for Revolution</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Corrupt the young, get them away from religion. Get them interested in sex. Make them superficial. Destroy their ruggedness.</li>
<li>Get control of all means of publicity.</li>
<li>Get people’s minds off their government by focusing their attention on athletics, sexy books and other trivialities.</li>
<li>Divide the people into hostile groups by constantly harping on controversial matters of no importance.</li>
<li>Destroy the people’s faith in their natural leaders by holding the latter up to contempt, ridicule and obloquy.</li>
<li>Always preach true democracy, but seize power as fast and as ruthlessly as possible.</li>
<li>By encouraging government extravagance, destroy its credit and produce fear of inflation with rising prices and general discontent.</li>
<li>Foment unnecessary strikes in vital industries, encourage civil disorders, and foster a lenient and soft attitude on the part of government toward such disorders.</li>
<li>By specious argument cause the breakdown of the old moral virtues, honesty, sobriety, continence, faith in the pledged word, ruggedness.</li>
<li>Cause the registration of all firearms on some pretext, with a view to confiscating them and leaving the populace helpless.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>By just taking a quick glance at the communist rules above we know how the rulers abuse modern people´s minds and we also know that their plan succeeded by looking at today´s society.</strong> Only the last step remains: seize dictatorial power and implement a world theocracy where our hidden rulers want to be worshipped as absolute Gods – just like Lucifer the devil did in the Bible.</p>
<h4><strong>Dalai Lama On Top Of The Jews – Our World Rulers Spill The Beans</strong></h4>

<p><em>Jews And Muslims Want “Buddhist” Dalai Lama As World Leader – Jerusalem Post 2006</em></p>
<p>In 2006 Jerusalem Post published an article about putting Dalai Lama as the world leader of all religions seated in Jerusalem – the installment of the prophecied Antichrist. According to MSM Tibet is a place full of kindhearted spiritual people who suffer from the evil Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
<p><strong>Is there another story? Why were the first Westerners who introduced Tibetan Lamaism to the west Satanists?</strong> How could Dalai Lama have an open door to all the Western leaders for 50 years while being the disputed ruler of a microscopic population of 6 million Tibetans in China? Why is he called the <strong>“God-King” </strong>or <strong>“His Holiness”</strong> by the Marxist MSM? After researching Dalai Lama and the history of Tibet we see the Asian origins of the Luciferian conspiracy against mankind clearly. <strong>The end goal is that our state officials want to be worshipped as living Gods just like Lucifer did in the Bible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Speaking of fake news and the MSM conflict between Tibet and the CCP we read a quote from Mao Zedong in 1954 and immediately understand his puppet status:</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Dalai Lama is a living Buddha. He is a living God. He was not elected by the people… They believe in the Dalai Lama and its local chief much more than they believe in us. It is impossible to shake his position…</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>To see the picture in the west we first note that President FD Roosevelt sent a Rolex watch in 1942 at the peak of WW II to 7 year old Dalai Lama – at a time when Tibet had no conflict with China</strong>. Then we read German General Ludendorff who said in the 1930s that <em>the Tibetan Lamas had emplaced themselves at the head of all Jewish and Christian secret societies. (“Europa den Asiatenpriestern” – “Europe belongs to the Asian priests”).</em></p>

<p><em>Soviet Army Swastika Symbol After The Bolsheviks Seized Power</em></p>
<p><strong>It might sound unbelievable after watching MSM for decades but you will find that the Lamas cooperated closely with the Bolsheviks, the Nazis, the Catholics and the secret societies in the west.</strong> The Lamas had an infamous reputation of being master sorcerers which attracted bad people from the west.</p>

<p><em>Tibetan Serfs Begging</em></p>
<p><strong>The old Tibetan feudal serf society is the real model of the NWO that the Nazis and Bolsheviks adored.</strong> A society where 95% of people have no rights whatsoever and there is an absolute despot in both temporal and spiritual matters. Theodor Illion, a German researcher who travelled disguised to the top secret underground city(and survived) in Tibet stated in the 1930s:</p>
<p><strong>”the Lamas…are more dangerous than all their cold and hot hells put together.”</strong></p>

<h4><strong>A Spiritual Practice Is The Prime Enemy Of The CCP</strong></h4>

<p><strong>China (Zhongguo) means “Center Of The World” in Chinese.</strong> The CCP named the spiritual practice of Falun Gong their prime enemy in 1999. Falun Gong quickly spread to 100 million Chinese people in the 1990s. Chinese leader Jiang Zemin became jealous of Falun Gong and wanted to wipe it out in three months. Falun Gong has been illegally outlawed and persecuted in China since 1999 with mass scale live organ harvesting being perhaps the most atrocious crime ever heard of. Despite intense persecution for almost 18 years Falun Gong has spread across the world to more than 100 countries and it still thrives secretly in China.</p>
<p><strong>Religions have not been a challenge to Marxists in modern times since they are easy to infiltrate and destroy from within.</strong> Falun Gong only has a Master, no membership, no money, no priests, all information online for free and it supports traditional culture. The focus in Falun Gong is on improving one´s mind and body in daily life by following the principles of <strong>“Truth-Compassion-Tolerance” </strong>in addition to doing physical exercises. That kind of faith is impossible to control and it´s a nightmare for the Marxists. It has never occurred anything similar with such a wide spread across the world in such a short time.</p>
<h4><strong>Shen Yun – Traditional Dance Company Persecuted Around The World By The CCP</strong></h4>

<p><em>Shen Yun Dancers Express Traditional Chinese Femininity (</em><a href="http://www.shenyun.com?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">www.shenyun.com</a><em>) </em></p>
<p><strong>We have seen the darkness and now we look for hope.</strong> The real hope is a new divinely inspired, traditional and beautiful culture, that’s the only thing that can make people kindhearted, humane and happy again. If there has been complete evil and deception in the world for at least 100 years there must be time for a change soon since nature changes cyclically.</p>
<p><strong>We have found a divinely inspired dance troupe that scares the wits out of the CCP.</strong> It´s called <strong>Shen Yun</strong> and Shen means divine being and represents the myriad of divine figures in Chinese history. Yun means rhytm and and conveys a person’s entire bearing. Shen Yun means <strong>the beauty of divine beings dancing in the heavens. That´s something which has never been displayed before.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction of Shen Yun: </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC35DjhLml8&amp;list=PLF9E98E7A36E17500?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><strong>Shen Yun Trailer(Youtube 30 secs)</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Shen Yun has become the largest classical Chinese dance company in the world touring about 150 cities every year with five dance companies and selling out their shows in most places.</strong> Since its beginnings the CCP has done everything in its power to stop these Shen Yun shows including threatening theatre directors across the world, slashing tires on touring buses, sending threatening letters to MPs and putting pressure on foreign departments etc. It´s a global persecution in many democratic countries. This year they slander Shen Yun with advertorials in large MSM outlets such as Washington Post, The Age,The Telegraph etc. This is a unique case of a world power attacking a US based dance troupe. <strong>This shows us that divine culture is what the Marxists fear most of all and that China does whatever it wants across the world.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Why Shen Yun Scares The CCP</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-120264" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8-300x200.png" alt="" width="446" height="297" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8-300x200.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8-768x512.png 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8-837x558.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8-667x445.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8-262x175.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8-574x383.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2017/04/8.png 945w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px"></p>
<p><em>True, positive, inner and outer human beauty – a lethal danger to Marxists</em><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The first reason is that Shen Yun was founded by Chinese-American Falun Gong practitioners. The very same people that they imprison in China spreads traditional culture in the west through dance and music.</p>
<p>The second reason is that Shen Yun tries to revive the brilliant and divinely inspired 5000-year old Chinese culture with all its different dynasties, legends, faiths and traditions spanning the whole of China. The female artists express true femininity and beauty in movements and costumes while the male ones are powerful and masculine. The CCP has distorted everything of traditional Chinese culture and turned it into a dark and gloomy Marxist version of human struggle with our fellow man, nature and the Gods.</p>
<p>People across the world are starving for spiritual food, inspiration and beautiful traditional culture. They go to see Shen Yun because they get a unique blend of divinely inspired culture, hope, spirituality and beauty. Shen Yun comes with a message that human beings are fundamentally divine beings that came down to earth with the hope to do some good things before returning to their divine realm. Society has reached its bottom and that is when the divine needs to step in and help good people. This message is indeed powerful, inclusive and beautiful and it´s a message people won´t hear in other dance shows.</p>
<p>Part 4: Dr. Day disclosed our falsified science in 1969. We investigate the Marxist purpose and frauds of the Evolution Theory. Finally a few words from prophecies about our predestined Marxist era and the unknown but magical and cataclysmic year of 2017. Finally real men will get their chance to fight the battle of all ages against the evil forces trying to enslave them.<strong> </strong></p>
