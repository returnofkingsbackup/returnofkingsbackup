<p>Have you been reading the manosphere for a while? Do you comment on several blogs? Well it’s inevitable that you’ll want to take the plunge and start your own blog. In that case, <a href="http://theprivateman.wordpress.com/">The Private Man</a> has you covered with <a href="http://theprivateman.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/manosphere-blogging-101-21-pieces-of-advice/">21 pieces of blog advice</a>. Here are my favorite five:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Blogging requires patience and perseverance. Blogging for a couple of months and being disappointed is normal. A few hundred (if you’re fortunate) page views a day is to be expected until readers realize the seriousness of the blog. There are few, if any, home runs with blogging. Writers should only expect singles and doubles as page view counts grow.</p>
<p>5. Haters gonna hate. Got hate comments? Nuke ‘em and ban ‘em. It’s your blog. It’s your real estate. If haters want to shit on your blog, moderate heavily and use the banhammer relentlessly. Don’t engage trolls… ever.</p>
<p>8. Brevity is the soul of wit. Posts needn’t be long. Rollo and Ian (links below) are the huge exception as their posts are usually quite long. You can’t be the exception to the rule until you’re well established. Three hundred words or so (well-written and concise) will do.</p>
<p>12. Find your niche. This will take time and your commenters will steer you in the right (write?) direction. As the Manosphere stands now, there are almost too many young men writing. For you young guys, consider focusing on a geographical or lifestyle niche on which to focus your concentration.</p>
<p>16. Post on forums with a link to your blog in your signature. There are loads of male-oriented forums that are not relationship of socially-focused oriented. Find the “other” category in gun, motorsports, sports, and male-oriented forums where men often go. Build a reputation there. Be taken seriously… then send them to your blog or other Manosphere blogs.</p>

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d like to add two of my own:</p>
<p><strong>1. You only need one post to get started.</strong> A lot of budding bloggers have the typical creator insecurity of “I’ll run out of ideas!” Hell, even I feel occasional doom that my well has been tapped, but necessity breeds invention and as soon as you hit publish on one post, your brain will send you an idea for another. If that doesn’t happen to you, then you haven’t had the right combination of experience and learnedness to synthesize your own ideas. Live and learn hard for a couple more years.</p>
<p><strong>2. You don’t exist in a bubble.</strong> The days are long gone when you could publish a piece of work and then sit back while you build devoted fans. Not only do you have to connect with your fans but you have to maintain positive relationships with bloggers who are in your field. You will depend on them for support as much as they will come to depend on you.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that it’s going to be very hard for you to start a manosphere blog today and get big league traffic, but that doesn’t mean you can’t cultivate a dedicated audience who encourages you to step out of your comfort zone while you attempt to make sense of the world. There will also be opportunities for younger guys to take initiative as myself and some of the other first-wave manosphere bloggers retreat from the game battlefield and move into lifestyle, political, or cultural topics. Gaps will be created for new guys to fill them.</p>
