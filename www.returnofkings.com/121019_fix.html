<p>The Soviet Union made exporting revolution a high priority. Although the USSR is gone, the effects of their subversion campaign linger to this day.</p>
<h4>The script for Communist takeover</h4>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/y3qkf3bajd4.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>KGB defector <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-bloggers/2637603/posts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yuri Bezmenov</a> gave an in-depth look.</p>
<blockquote><p>[O]nly about fifteen percent of time, money and manpower is spent on espionage as such. The other eighty-five percent is a slow process which we call either ideological subversion or active measures, or psychological warfare.</p></blockquote>
<p>He described how they <em>recruited journalists and prominent figures</em> to spread the Party line. Further, they compiled hit lists, including Communist sympathizers likely to outlive their usefulness after the Revolution.</p>
<p>Bezmenov described the <a href="http://www.smashculturalmarxism.com/the-four-stages-of-ideological-subversion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolutionary script</a> as demoralization, destabilization, crisis, and normalization. After coming to the USA, he was horrified to see this process <em>well in development</em>. Let’s see how his predictions from 1984 turned out.</p>
<h4>Demoralization</h4>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/gIdBuK7_g3M.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>It takes from fifteen to twenty years to demoralize a nation… Because this is the minimum number of years required to educate one generation of students… exposed to the ideology of the enemy. In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations of American students, without being challenged or contra-balanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism.</p></blockquote>
<p>This has been the standard brainwashing for college students since the 1960s. This is why <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/90815/how-the-cultural-marxists-of-the-frankfurt-school-subverted-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subverting education</a> was instrumental.</p>
<p>Getting the media on board—our other opinion-forming institution—surely was much easier, given all the fellow travelers and such-like already running the show.</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of the people who graduated in the sixties, drop outs or half-baked intellectuals, are now occupying the positions of power in the government, civil service, business, mass media, educational system. You are stuck with them. You cannot get rid of them. They are contaminated. They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what the leftist “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114104/what-is-cultural-marxism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long March through the institutions</a>” did. The educational system is thoroughly pozzed out. Even the K-12 public schools have become indoctrination centers, with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/111554/todays-youth-are-being-encouraged-to-become-transsexual" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sickening results</a>.</p>
<p>Propaganda saturates <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98243/confessions-of-a-former-journalist-in-the-corrupt-media-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">journalism</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75991/why-star-wars-the-force-awakens-is-a-social-justice-propaganda-film" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollyweird</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/90497/society-has-awakened-from-the-collective-delusion-of-the-television-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">television</a>, the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/87477/how-new-york-killed-male-literature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">literary establishment</a>, the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/58851/5-things-wrong-with-modern-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music industry</a>, and a great many <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/110604/why-we-must-boycott-national-geographic-until-they-are-bled-dry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magazines</a>. It’s even seeping into mindless entertainment like <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/84674/how-working-at-comic-con-showed-me-that-america-is-a-nation-of-cucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comic books</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/115977/the-hidden-agenda-behind-interracial-pornography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pornography</a>. Many other institutions have been subverted, of course: government, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114295/what-is-virtue-signalling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">big corporations</a>, several nonprofits, even many <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/108191/is-pope-francis-destroying-the-catholic-church" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">religions</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already. For the last twenty-five years, actually it’s over-fulfilled because the demoralization now reaches such areas where previously not even comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such a tremendous success. Most of it is done by Americans to Americans thanks to lack of moral standards.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Destabilization</h4>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/JmMw9aMXmMY.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>After society has been softened up, then the plan is to create chaos leading to a revolutionary ferment.</p>
<blockquote><p>This time, and it takes only two to five years to destabilize a nation, what matters is essentials. Economy, foreign relations, defense systems. And you can see it quite clearly that in some areas, in such sensitive areas as defense and economy, the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the United States is absolutely fantastic. I could never believe it fourteen years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the process will go that fast.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Age of Aquarius had a violent undercurrent. This included angry demonstrations that sometimes got out of hand, terrorism by <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116255/the-stories-of-two-domestic-terrorist-groups-that-were-dropped-in-the-memory-hole" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leftist whack-jobs</a>, and race riots. As G. Gordon Liddy, an FBI agent and Watergate burglar, described:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]e were involved in an exterior war in Vietnam, but they tend to forget that we were also embroiled in an undeclared civil war at home. And unless you can understand the nature of that struggle and the issues it posed for the administration in Washington, you’ll never be able to understand my motives or the motives of my associates in undertaking the actions and running the risks we did. We were up against a formidable constellation of forces in those days, an alliance of influential elements of the media with a so-called counterculture that represented a Weltanschauung and lifestyle that were utterly repugnant to me. […]</p>
<p>We didn’t have a crystal ball at our disposal in those days that would inform us that mass student opposition to the war would peter out after the end of the draft, or that the racial cauldron in the big cities would eventually simmer down. We had to act on our best intelligence assessment of the forces arrayed against us, and that assessment was far from encouraging, particularly when you consider the revolutionaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/117722/3-pieces-of-kgb-propaganda-americans-still-believe-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vasili Mitrokhin</a>, another KGB insider, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The attempt to stir up racial tensions in the United States remained part of Service A’s stock-in-trade for the remainder of the Cold War.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, Communists have been up to that since the 1930s. Besides inner city riots, most other havoc was from the not-always-peaceful peace movement; it would be an obvious priority for the Soviets to hamstring the Vietnam War effort. This doesn’t mean that all the protesters were taking orders from the KGB; most just didn’t want to get drafted. Still, Soviet “active measures” (even when indirect) had their effect.</p>
<p>During the 1960s, chaos reached a fever pitch. Then during the Reagan years, things got almost as calm as during the 1950s. Afterward, disorder returned to approximately the late 1970s level and stayed that way.</p>

<p>Then during the Obama administration, angry demonstrations and riots against the police became relatively frequent. Often the participants included <a href="http://www.weaselzippers.us/224034-more-proof-of-paid-protesters-ad-asking-for-protesters-to-travel-to-protest-list-of-payouts-to-ferguson-protest-organizers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paid protesters</a> bused in from out of state. Worse, on-duty police officers started getting assassinated. The <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/01/the-roots-of-black-lives-matter-unveiled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">agitation groups</a> haven’t been linked to that, though their rhetoric didn’t quite promote tranquility.</p>
<p>Finally, 2016 saw rioting reminiscent of the 1960s. <em>Was someone trying to start something?</em> Is it merely a coincidence that was an election year?</p>
<h4>Crisis</h4>
<div id="attachment_66935" style="width: 436px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

<p>The flash point begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>The next stage of course is crisis. It may take only up to six weeks to bring a country to the verge of crisis. You can see it in Central America now.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the wake of the 2008 economic meltdown, Obama was elected, promising to fix the economy. He was also supposed to heal America’s racial divisions, halve the deficit within his first term, get us out of war within a year, and give everyone <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/rulings/promise-broken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a pony for Christmas</a>. Somehow The Lightworker managed to get re-elected, proving conclusively that the masses have a short memory.</p>
<p>Surely there are those who can hardly wait to exploit (<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75335/what-is-the-hegelian-dialectic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or engineer</a>) some new crisis. What form this might take, and whether it might be more successful, is anyone’s guess.</p>
<h4>Normalization</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-85292 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/obama.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="368" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/obama.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/obama-300x221.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/obama-262x193.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<blockquote><p>And after crisis with a violent change of power structure and economy you have so called the period of normalization… This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all the schmucks to bring the country to crisis, to promise people all kind of goodies and the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/119681/why-communism-doesnt-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paradise on Earth</a>, to destabilize your economy, to eliminate the principle of free market competition and to put big brother government in Washington DC…</p></blockquote>
<p>In the end, they had to settle for the legal route, which means <em>they didn’t get everything they wanted</em>. Therefore, it was a remarkably half-assed revolution. Rather than a radical <em>Gleichschaltung,</em> they got a dysfunctional healthcare law.</p>
<p>So the leftists got their mediocre “community organizer” elected. After that, they placed their hopes with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/93777/hillary-and-bill-clinton-are-criminal-masterminds-wielding-incredible-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillary</a>, expected to run against some <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98814/todays-mainstream-conservatives-only-serve-the-globalist-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lukewarm Republican</a> nominee.</p>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p><img class="wp-image-121023 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/civil-unrest-USA.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="330" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/civil-unrest-USA.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/civil-unrest-USA-300x198.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/civil-unrest-USA-262x173.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>How much of the revolutionary activities beginning in the 1960s were caused by the KGB’s “active measures” campaign? The circumstantial case is pretty compelling, but the full story hasn’t yet been told. It’s easy to underestimate how <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well-networked</a> the radical left was.</p>
<p>I’ll concur with Bezmenov that the demoralization process has been over-fulfilled. Leftists are <em>still</em> pushing psychological warfare. (In 1984, <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/western-society-is-being-completely-inverted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">today’s degradation</a> would’ve been unimaginable.) Destabilization was very promising at first, but <em>they failed to keep the ball rolling</em>. Thus, they never got to the point where a violent overthrow was possible.</p>
<p>Then in 1991, the USSR dissolved. Thus, the KGB was <em>no longer in control</em>. Still, this was far from the end of the story. Their dysfunctional “for export” ideology—<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116006/the-dysfunction-of-modern-society-is-proof-that-cultural-marxism-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cultural Marxism</a>, better known as progressivism—is still shoved down our throats by the schools and the media. Certain elements have embraced it, from <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95868/the-delusional-reality-of-social-justice-warriors-is-a-form-of-mental-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SJW losers</a> to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/119922/the-root-cause-of-our-problems-with-government-is-tight-centralization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">petty bureaucrats</a> to the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95710/how-a-small-cabal-is-using-socialism-cultural-marxism-to-consolidate-world-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ultra-wealthy</a> (quite ironically) who find it useful for their purposes.</p>
<p>Cultural Marxism lost something vital after it was co-opted by a clique of decadent billionaires with a God complex. Although their shadow government (usually) can anoint the candidates for both parties, they still have to operate through figureheads. Their New World Order dictatorship isn’t ready for prime time. They overplayed their hand. The public is <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/99001/7-wikileaks-revelations-about-hillary-clinton-that-the-media-is-completely-ignoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting wise</a> to their games, and they <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/100627/trump-presidency-creates-mountains-of-salt-from-butthurt-liberals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lost their chance</a> for Queen Hillary to finish the job on us.</p>
<p>We now have a fighting chance to restore national self-determination. <em>The future is what we make it.</em></p>
