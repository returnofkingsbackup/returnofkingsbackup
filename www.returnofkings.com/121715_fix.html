<p>Growing a beard is one of the easiest ways to make yourself more attractive to women. Beards are a quintessential aspects of physical masculinity: a lush carpet of hair on your face will make you stand out from clean-shaved men and give you an advantage in the mating dance. However, there’s a right way and a wrong way to maintain a beard, and if you do it wrong, you’ll look like a dork instead of like a man. Here’s how to maintain your beard the right way…</p>
<h3>1. Grow Your Beard Out Before You Start Shaping It</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-121732" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/beard-one.jpg" alt="" width="429" height="429" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/beard-one.jpg 570w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/beard-one-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/beard-one-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/beard-one-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/beard-one-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px"></p>
<p>Many men make the mistake of trying to sculpt their beard before it’s fully grown out. This is a major error. It takes time for a beard to reach a length where sculpting it is possible, and doing it too soon will make you look awkward and weird. Think of your beard as a canvass: it needs to be treated gingerly if you want to develop it. To spare yourself these problems, grow your beard out for at least <em>two months</em> before you begin shaping it.</p>
<h3>2. Clean Up Any Straggling Hairs</h3>
<p>This is the second stage of beard maintenance. Beards that are thick and dense look more masculine and powerful, so you want to keep your beard as orderly and neat as possible. The thicker the beard, the better: thin beards make you look weak and project vulnerability instead of strength, hurting your attractiveness to women.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-121723" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-1.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="438" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-1.jpg 424w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-1-300x452.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-1-262x395.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-121724" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-2.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="500" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-2.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-2-300x448.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-2-262x391.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-121725" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-3.jpg" alt="" width="371" height="500" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-3.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-3-300x404.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/dense-beard-3-262x353.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"></p>
<p>Because hairs grow at different rates, you’ll want to trim runaway hairs at the bottom that are growing too quickly in order to give the appearance that your beard is as thick as possible. Do this on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>3. Regularly Shave The Neck And Upper Cheeks</h3>
<p>The absolute last thing you want is a neckbeard. Men with neckbeards get mocked on the Internet for a reason: they’re gross, messy, and make you look like a homeless person. If you grow a neckbeard, you might as well just forget about women and buy yourself a fedora and a lifetime supply of Cheetos.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-121726" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-1.jpg 640w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-1-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-1-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-1-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-121727" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-2.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-2.jpg 480w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-2-300x400.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/neckbeard-2-262x349.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px"></p>
<p>To avoid looking like a euphoric atheist, regularly shave your neck and upper cheeks so that your beard looks neat. You’ll want to walk a line between being too fussy and being too lax. Try and make it so that you don’t look like you’re trimming your beard every day even when you are. You want your beard to look as effortless as possible, like it just magically sprouted from your face in an organized pattern and maintains an even length.</p>

<h3>4. Keep Your Beard Symmetrical</h3>
<p>Scientific studies have shown that people with symmetrical facial features are considered more attractive. This goes for beards as well: asymmetrical beards look weird and off-putting. To this end, you’ll want to keep your beard as symmetrical as possible. This can be somewhat difficult with traditional beard grooming products, as these pictures show…</p>
