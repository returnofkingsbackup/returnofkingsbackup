<p>A GANG of five terrorists wearing stab-proof vests drove a B&amp;Q van into pedestrians at 50mph on London Bridge before attacking revellers with hunting knives.</p>
<p>Up to seven people were feared dead and 20 hurt in the 10pm attack – amid a second incident at nearby Borough Market which armed police are responding to.</p>
<p>Two explosions have been heard outside The Sun offices in London Bridge at 1:23am and 1:25am.</p>
<p>A third huge explosion was heard at 1:28am near The Shard in London Bridge as multiple fire engines are parked outside.</p>
<p>Witness Erick Siguenza told BBC News that one of the gang screamed “This is for Allah” as he went on his stabbing rampage.</p>
<p>Staff at a packed pub in London Bridge locked the doors as the gang tried to smash their way in. Witnesses saw one man stabbed in the chest five times.</p>
<p>The gang had metal canisters strapped to their chests and two were gunned down – believe killed – by armed police, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Another three were thought to be still on the run as the police have confirmed that the attacks in London Bridge and Borough Market are “terror incidents.”</p>
<p>One bystander is believed to have been shot in the head by crossfire.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police confirmed a third incident in the Vauxhall area, after tweeting “you must run, hide and tell,” which later turned out to be an unrelated stabbing.</p>
<p>Fifty armed police have stormed Monument station with police dogs and have told people to run. The travel hub along with nearby Bank station, both across the river from London Bridge, have been closed.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Theresa May has said the “terrible incident” is being treated as a “potential act of terrorism”.</p>

<p>Paul Clarke filmed the reported stabbing in a restaurant, with police since confiscating his phone for evidence.</p>
<p>He said he heard gunfire unleashed in the restaurant, with a man appearing to be a chef injured.</p>
<p>He said: “I saw three people coming in.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what he had in his hand, it looked like a big long weapon.</p>
<p>“There was a man, one of the kitchen staff, on the floor, and the man was doing a stabbing motion.</p>
<p>“I just thought, we’ve got to get out of here.”</p>
<p>He said he and his friends then ran from the scene.</p>
