<p>You will always face competition in the sexual marketplace—that is inevitable. What is important is that you improve yourself to the best of your ability to raise your inherent value while employing game principles to do the best for yourself that you can within that market.</p>
<h3>Hot Women</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-122941" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women-300x249.jpg" alt="hot women" width="300" height="249" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women-300x249.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women-768x636.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women-837x694.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women-667x553.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women-262x217.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women-574x476.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hot-women.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, the sexual marketplace is extremely competitive. Hot young women, particularly those aged between 18 and 23 or so are prized beyond belief in Western societies. If you are a thin, attractive girl in her early-twenties with an Instagram account then you can make a fortune just by putting out daily pictures of yourself in swimwear.</p>
<p>Offers of money, travel, handbags, clothes and other luxury goods come flooding in. Trips to Dubai and other glamourous international destinations are thrown at these girls like confetti. London in particular is filled with sexy young things who don’t work but instead spend all of their time trailing around Selfridges, Harrods and Harvey Nichols buying the latest designer clothes with money given to them by their ‘sponsors’.</p>
<p>In game terms we might decry such male tactics as mere ‘beta provisioning’. After all, if you have to shower a girl with gifts to get her into bed then that’s not ‘proper’ game right? And in any case, she’s not really into you, she’s only after you for your money anyway.</p>
<p>Well, yes and no. While I would never advocate that men lavish money on women whom they haven’t slept with yet (or any women come to that), nevertheless it is important to realise the the guys who do this kind of thing are not all simpering chodes. Quite the opposite. In London (as in other international cities) the guys who park their £350,000 Lamborghini Murcielagos outside Harrods are far closer to the Dan Bilzerian model of international playboys than not. Many of these men are not only very wealthy, they’re also good-looking, jacked and not lacking in self-confidence.</p>
<p>Does all of this mean that you should find a way to join the billionaire’s jet set club yourself, or else give up all hope of meeting hot women? No, of course not. But it does mean that you should be aware of the competition. The old adage may say that there’s always someone worse off than you, but the converse is also true: there’s always someone better off than you, too.</p>
<h3>There’s Always Competition For Her</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-122943" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/competition-1-300x425.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/competition-1-300x425.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/competition-1-667x944.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/competition-1-262x371.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/competition-1-574x813.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/competition-1.jpg 678w" sizes="(max-width: 212px) 100vw, 212px"></p>
<p>This is why guys who do day game ‘because there’s less competition’ are way off beam. There<em> is</em> competition, it’s just you can’t see it. In the club your competitors are instantly discernible. They are physically present after all, trying to AMOG their way into your sets, disrupt things or steal your girl by some other means.</p>
<p>But don’t imagine that 8 you just stopped outside Topshop is any less sought after. Just because you can’t see them, don’t imagine for one moment that there aren’t other men waiting in the wings, on Instagram or Tinder or Snapchat or in the club on Friday night who are also aiming to bang her (or are banging her already).</p>

<p>As I said at the start, you will always face competition in the marketplace: markets, after all, are predicated on competition. So what should you do in order to give yourself the best possible chance? Three things. Improve yourself to the best of your ability, learn game and have realistic expectations.</p>
<h3>Give Yourself A Chance</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-55969" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hot-girl-and-guy-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hot-girl-and-guy-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hot-girl-and-guy-262x173.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hot-girl-and-guy.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Enough has been written about self-improvement here and on many other websites, so you don’t need me reminding you about the importance of lifting once again. But for god’s sake be the best version of yourself you can possibly be. You’d think this didn’t need saying anymore but it does, since guys contact me all the time asking for solutions to their ‘game’ problems when they’ve got shitty haircuts and clothes, bad posture and skinny-fat bodies.</p>
<p>The truth is that you’re never going to be as hot as that Calvin Klein model or the dude on the cover of Men’s Health, but you need to make a start. Put yourself in the right ballpark. At least be a contender.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to learn game. By that I mean both game principles (approaching, vibing, cocky funny, leading, being dominant, escalation and closing). But you also need to internalise important game attitudes that have come to the fore in the community in the last decade or so, in particular abundance mentality and persistence.</p>
<p>Which leads me on to my final point about realistic expectations. Here’s the reality: game isn’t, and never was a magic trick. No one is promising that you’ll pull a supermodel from the arms of a Russian oligarch just by learning a few lines off the internet (although such things can and do happen). Game simply provides you with hacks that cut to the heart of female attraction obviating (to some extent) the need for riches or a six-pack of a Maserati.</p>
<p>If you are persistent with your game, approach a lot of women, are philosophical about rejection and hold onto an awareness that there are billions of girls out there for you to choose from, then in time you <em>will</em> get results. But don’t fall into the trap of believing that the competition will just fall away, because that dude on the Rich Kids of London Instagram feed wants to get laid too, and he’s fishing from the same pool you are.</p>
<p>A more realistic and healthy way to approach game (and any competitive endeavor) is to compete only against yourself. Think of the girls you slept with last year. How hot were they? How does that compare to your performance this year? If your results have dipped for whatever reason then it’s time to tweak your game. But if they’re improved then that’s cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Yes, there is strong sexual competition out there and no, you are not immune to it just because you watched a few game videos on YouTube. That said, there is an abundance of women out there for you to approach, and when you realise it is only really your prior performance that you are up against then that makes the whole project suddenly seem a lot more manageable.</p>
