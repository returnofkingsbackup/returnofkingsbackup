<p>Donald Trump symbolizes the West’s outrage with a totally corrupt political structure that is rotting out society from within. There is little doubt among both the right and the left that public opinion matters very little when it comes to decision making in the halls of power. What does matter is who bankrolls the legislative prostitutes who call themselves “representatives” when bills are crafted and passed in the slimy Beltway and other crumbling capitals of the West.</p>
<p>It’s always interesting and important to put what is happening on the small scale of history we are living day to day into a larger historical scheme. There’s an important work that does just that. As reported here at ROK in the past, Oswald Spengler’s <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/77942/how-a-german-historian-predicted-western-decline-100-years-ago">Decline Of The West</a> made some stunningly accurate predictions for the world of today when it was published a century ago.</p>
<p>It’s important to revisit this work in greater detail as it is more relevant now than ever with what’s happening in American politics.</p>
<h3>The Predictions</h3>
<div id="attachment_122957" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-122957" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue_Liberty-300x180.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="252" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue_Liberty-300x180.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue_Liberty-262x157.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Statue_Liberty.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Democracy ultimately fails because economic powers corrupt it and gridlock forms as both sides become polarized</p>
</div>
<p>As evidence we are playing out the string of events predicted by Spengler, all of the following predictions for the ongoing decline of Europe and its spin-off civilization of Anglo America (the U.S. and Canada—and lets not forget Australia) have come true. Here are the events we are living through as predicted a century ago in his civilization model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Domination of Money. Economic powers permeating the political forms and authorities.</strong> This is plain to see as economic powers now rule both sides of the pond and down under rather than “representatives” who are supposed to represent the Will of the People and not economic interests.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transition from constitutional order to informal sway of individuals. </strong>This is also plain to see, as the Constitution of the U.S. is being scrapped by the Patriot Act, NDAA, TSA, and all sorts of insidious legislation designed to gut the Bill of Rights. Personality is beginning to matter more than principle as we are seeing with the recent elections of Obama and Trump.</li>
<li>
<strong>Imperialism.</strong> America now has military bases in 130 out of 196 nations on the planet and its foreign and military policy usually involves imposing the ideals of American business interests abroad.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above bullet points are where we find ourselves today. The below is what is predicted to come this century.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Formation of Caesarism. Victory of force-politics over money. Increasing primitiveness of political forms. Inward decline of the nations into a formless population, and constitution thereof as an Imperium of gradually-increasing crudity of despotism. </strong>Once again, we can already see this happening in the West. Political forms are becoming more primitive and tribal in nature. Western nations are becoming demographic polyglot boarding houses. The government is becoming increasingly autocratic and unresponsive to the needs and wishes of its people. All that’s left is the victory of force-politics over money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spengler thought blood was the only force that could overcome the power of money, and indeed, as one politician after another make lofty promises that go unfulfilled once they assume the reigns of power, more and more people are beginning to realize voting is doing nothing to change their lot in life. As user “Dan” recently put it on my comments thread: <em>The people who actually have the power to change things simply won’t. Why? Because the system worked for them.</em></p>
<p>The formation of Caesarism <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/83450/why-we-should-expect-the-rise-of-a-caesar-this-century">is an idea we have touched on previously</a>, but never has it been so plain that’s where the West is headed than with the election of Donald Trump and what he represents in the minds of his supporters.</p>

<h3>Trump is Only the Beginning</h3>

</div>
<p>While Trump reflects the desire of the Silent Majority to finally have their voices heard, it appears they’ll have to wait for a future strongman to actually implement their demands. Unfortunately, it seems Trump won’t be the savior many had hoped for as he has proven he is least partly compromised by lauding the passing of Obamacare Lite by a RINO Congress, and by creating a sideshow about taking America out of the global warming scam when the very next day his Vice President said the deal <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jun/2/mike-pence-donald-trump-open-renegotiating-paris-d/">would merely be renegotiated</a> and is not dead on arrival.</p>
<p><a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2017/06/03/the-new-world-order-will-go-on-as-scheduled-global-warming-flap-is-another-distraction/">In effect, the global warming flap amounts to much ado about nothing once again</a>, the typical Washington playbook. This playbook says to bait the public with a false narrative and let the two sides of the political aisle fight it out until they’re exhausted. The false narrative – which both sides bought hook, line and sinker – is that global taxation via global warming was stopped by Trump. This narrative is the shadow in Plato’s cave. However, looking beyond the shadow, the truth is renegotiation changes little more than details of which globalists get your tax money and how much they get to fight an element on the periodic table that all life cannot live without – carbon. Even Trump once famously said the global warming narrative is a hoax designed to rob the taxpayer. Why would he renegotiate a deal based on a hoax?</p>
<p>Chalk this one up as yet another issue Trump has pivoted away from his base on, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2017/04/29/is-the-don-betraying-his-voters-trump-now-says-hes-a-globalist/">including his astonishing remarks that he was a nationalist and a globalist a month ago</a>. The two ideals are incompatible. Obama shafted the left with broken promises and soaring rhetoric. Will Trump shaft the right?</p>
<div id="attachment_34830" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-34830" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/the-cave.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="280"><p class="wp-caption-text">Look beyond the shadows in Plato’s cave to see the truth</p>
</div>
<p>Putting political game playing aside, the important point is what Trump represents in the minds of his followers. People want a resolute leader, and are sick of squabbling Demicans and Republicrats who exist only to rule them, fool them, and rob them. If Trump doesn’t deliver tangible change, and it appears he will offer little more than window dressing and platitudes, the masses will become increasingly disgusted with and disinterested in political promises in the future.</p>
<p>There are additional issues that will exacerbate the fatigue with politics as usual in the West. As immigrants displace natives from the West, there will be increasing conflict rendering democracy unworkable. This relates to the “formless population” ideal elucidated above. There is little doubt that whites and other immigrant groups have very different ways of life. Once whites become minorities in their native lands, displaced by other ethnic groups, tension will mount. Democracy will become unworkable as the different factions vie for control and political supremacy.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen, Spengler’s predictions tell us when the time comes the people will demand a resolute leader and discard gridlocked, ineffective government in which their demands fall on deaf ears. They will welcome a man of decision, who brings order to the chaos caused by democracy.</p>
<p>The question that remains is once democracy breaks down, will we get a good Caesar or a bad one? If the new strongman is blessed by the elite, the masses can expect unrelenting torment as only a fraction of the elite’s ultimate aims are being felt because the remains of democracy provide a buffer against total abuse of the populace – for the time being. If the new strongman ascends the throne from below, there’s at least a decent chance he’ll begin to dismantle the control matrix being devised by the corporate-government complex.</p>
<p>Do you think the end of democracy would be a good thing? Would a good or bad Caesar assume power? It’s interesting to think about, since Spengler’s predictions thus far have been spot-on for the declining Western world.</p>
