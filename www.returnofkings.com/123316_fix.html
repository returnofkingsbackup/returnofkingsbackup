<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>There is a recent news article under the headline ‘<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/08/health/trans-man-pregnant-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“My body is awesome’: Trans man expecting first child</a>“, about a couple in Portland, Oregon who are having a baby in July. The noteworthy <em>(well, sort of)</em> part of the story is that—according to the article, anyway—both parents are men.</p>
<h4>A dude got pregnant?</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-122888 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wtf.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wtf.jpg 480w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wtf-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wtf-262x197.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>
<p>No, this isn’t from the <em>Weekly World News</em>. Neither is it from <em>The Onion</em>. It’s from <em>CNN.</em> It’s not just the Clinton News Network either, because several other mainstream media sources are covering the same story, all with the same glowing tone. The article indicates that the expectant mother…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…who was assigned the female gender at birth and says he kept his “original parts,” adds that he never wanted to change his body.</p>
<p>“I think my body is awesome. I feel like it’s a gift to have been born with the body that I did, and I made the necessary changes so that I could keep living in it, both through hormones and through other body modifications…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, the first sentence has two framing tactics in it; I understand that much. What I don’t understand is how the second sentence makes any sense in light of the first.</p>
<p>Clearly the reporter covered nothing but softball questions. I would’ve asked: “If you never wanted to change your body, then why take steroids and get body modifications?” After that, “How is it possible for two males to conceive a baby together?” I might also ask how they plan to explain this to the kid later on, or if they feel there’s a risk the child or his peers will be confused. The interviewer clearly didn’t have the balls for that, any more than the mother does. Given the state of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98243/confessions-of-a-former-journalist-in-the-corrupt-media-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today’s journalism</a>, though, any reporter asking questions like that would be looking for a new job.</p>
<p>Anyway, it continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m OK with my body being a trans body. I’m OK being a man who has a uterus and has the capacity and capability of carrying a baby. I don’t feel like it makes me any less of a man. I just happen to be a man who is able to carry a baby.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hold that thought for a moment; we’ll be getting back to that line of argumentation shortly. The second half of the article is stuff about gastric symptoms, food cravings, and telling their two adopted kids that another little one is on the way. That would have <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/115481/journalists-ask-stupid-questions-to-push-their-narrative-and-conceal-the-truth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questionable relevance</a> even if they were covering a big celebrity’s pregnancy. Perhaps there’s some real information in the couple’s linked Facebook video, but I don’t feel like watching it for fear of getting gastric symptoms.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://people.com/bodies/transgender-man-pregnant-expanding-family-with-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another puff piece</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The partners say that the Portland community has been “incredibly supportive”… partly because it’s not uncommon there for a transgender man to carry a baby.</p>
<p>“We know dozens of transgender men who have gone through this exact same process, and there is now quite a bit of medical evidence that shows that this would be a safe and healthy thing for us to engage in, medically speaking…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. What’s up with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8320/6-reasons-why-portland-sucks-for-single-men" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portland</a>, anyway?</p>
<h4>Leftists don’t get biology</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-38833" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Paris_Tuileries_Garden_Facepalm_statue.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"></p>
<p>Those who are perplexed can have a look at the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/female" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dictionary definition</a> of female. In the context of animal biology, this means:</p>
<blockquote><p>…of, relating to, or being the sex that typically has the capacity to bear young or produce eggs</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right. Getting pregnant—or simply being born with the required body parts to do so—is proof of being female.</p>

<p>Leftists tend to look down their nose at creationists for denying the theory of evolution, considering them to be superstitious sixth grade dropouts or the like. Fine, I’ve read <a href="https://rainbowalbrecht.wordpress.com/2016/08/17/how-social-justice-warriors-wrecked-the-atheist-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Dawkins</a> too; I get it about natural selection and survival of the fittest. In my heathen opinion, that there’s nothing wrong with believing that Providence <a href="https://rainbowalbrecht.wordpress.com/2016/10/19/reconciling-genesis-with-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set things in motion</a>, though that’s beside the point.</p>
<p>Now here’s the thing. If creationists can be criticized for denying Darwinism then leftists who believe in this gender-bending stuff can be criticized for denying basic biology. Even the most diehard fundamentalist knows what a man or a woman is. These aren’t some blurry, undefinable categories either. Actually, it’s right there in the beginning of their creation story:</p>
<blockquote><p>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now who understands this aspect of basic biology better: Bible thumpers, or leftists who proclaim that there are dozens of genders (but only one race, of course)? Even when I was a very small child, I understood that boys and girls are different; further, they act different and are interested in different things. So what’s with all these journalists (and professors) who can’t figure it out?</p>
<p>Despite all that, I’m convinced that deep down, even the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95868/the-delusional-reality-of-social-justice-warriors-is-a-form-of-mental-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looniest SJWs</a> actually know what male and female mean, but their ideology blinds them to reality. They know the truth, but avoid cognitive dissonance by putting up a mental shield (“crimestop” in Orwell’s Newspeak) or create elaborate rationalizations to avoid thoughtcrime. Even leftists who recognize that the narrative is bullshit might not dare to speak up, because they’d risk getting <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/118313/the-fault-lines-in-progressive-paradise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shouted down</a> and ostracized.</p>
<p>Really, it’s pretty sad. The ability to create life is an awesome and unique part of being female, although radical feminists tend to have some <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116161/3-feminists-who-caused-the-most-harm-to-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strange complexes</a> about that. Now the MSM pushes the line that this isn’t even a uniquely female characteristic. <em>Who do they think they’re trying to fool, anyway?</em> Their increasingly transparent propaganda contrary to the public’s values and sensibility is why they’re <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/89090/3-reasons-for-the-downfall-of-mainstream-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">losing readership</a>. They’ve blown their credibility, and their audience is starting to tune them out.</p>
<p>The truth is that a “trans man” is a confused stone butch who might take lots of steroids or get her breasts removed, but <em>none of that turns her into a man</em>. An actual man can go to gay bathhouses and take a thousand loads from other dudes without the slightest chance of pregnancy. (I wouldn’t care to observe it, but you know what I mean.) In any event, people should respect their bodies.</p>
<h4>More logic</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64018" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/highly-illogical.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="250" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/highly-illogical.jpg 250w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/highly-illogical-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"></p>
<p>Can we call <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> on this <a href="http://www.fgfbooks.com/Sobran-Joe/2016/Sobran160713.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gender bending stuff</a> now? Something can’t be true and not true at the same time. If an argument leads to this kind of contradiction, then it’s wrong. You can’t reconcile “women are the sex that can give birth” with “a man can get pregnant”. As <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/101610/an-alternative-right-perspective-on-objectivism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ayn Rand</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you find yourself facing an apparent contradiction, check your premises. You will find that one of them is wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from that, these “man gets pregnant” articles—lacking any difficult questions, not balancing it with alternative perspectives, and uncritically accepting a very bizarre narrative—is a clear sign of how low modern journalism has fallen. Consider it a good indication of the MSM’s reliability.</p>
<p>I miss the <em>Weekly World News</em>. If they wrote about a man getting pregnant, they’d make it entertaining, and they wouldn’t pretend it was real. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/105550/10-recent-examples-of-fake-news-from-the-real-news-media" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fake news</a> was a lot better when it was fun.</p>
