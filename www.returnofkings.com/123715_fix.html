<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p class="p1">If you’re still stuck in the 9-5 Slave World that the modern corporatocracy has become for most normal men, you’ve probably dreamed of a way out of the intolerable mess that most of us are expected to stomach as a “career.”</p>
<p class="p1">You know what I mean. The world where merit makes no difference, where the most skilled liar and politician gets the promotion… the world where half the people you work with are only there because they fit the right “victim group” to be included in your company’s latest “<em>Diversity And Inclusiveness Initiative</em>.”</p>
<p class="p1">It’s a world where even a hint of a joke or comment that might even POTENTIALLY make someone “uncomfortable” gets you called into the office for a chat with the purple-haired HR Manager (who’s been itching to fire you since the day you were hired).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-116933" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/6.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="294"></p>
<p class="p1">“Success” in Slave World means a complete shutdown of your own sense of humor, your own sense of truth, your mind, your soul and your spirit. You must either submit to the prevailing narratives, or be stamped with a Mindcrime and cast onto the streets without a second thought (by people who’ve never even had a first one).</p>
<p class="p1">It’s enough to make any man miserable, and the more “awake” he is to the truths of our culture and its intricately fabricated narrative, the more painful the experience will be for him.</p>
<p class="p1">In just a moment, I’m going to explain to you the three major reasons why a freelance copywriting career is the “way out“ you’ve been looking for—if you’ve got the will to strike out on your own and the will to hone your craft.</p>
<p class="p1">But before I do, I’d like to come clean about something…</p>
<p class="p1">This isn’t my first article on Return of Kings. I’ve submitted—and had published—a number of articles on this site (under various pseudonyms) tackling topics everywhere from foreign culture wars to the root of Marxist infestation right here at home.</p>
<p class="p1">I then went “underground” for a couple years, stopped writing anything for anyone, and focused entirely on building my own business as a copywriter and internet marketer.</p>
<p class="p1">Now that I’ve arrived at my destination, allow me to “send the elevator” back down and give you the three biggest reasons why I encourage you to follow in my footsteps and rediscover what it means to be happy and free in this profoundly disturbed society of ours.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>1. It’s A Complete Meritocracy</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-63092" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/472px-Challenge_vs_skill.svg_.png" alt="" width="398" height="422"></p>
<p class="p1">It doesn’t matter what your last name is, it doesn’t matter how much money you were born into, it doesn’t matter what “certifications” you have, and it doesn’t matter where you went to college (if you went at all). My very first copywriting mentor—who spends his time traveling the world and giving workshops—never even made it past 8th grade.</p>
<p class="p1">It doesn’t matter what your skin color is, it doesn’t matter what gender you are, and there are no free bonus points for whining the loudest or being part of any particular demographic.</p>
<p class="p1">The one and only thing that matters is whether you can actually write copy that converts. That means either the ads you write turn prospects into customers, or you don’t even get the scraps that fall off the table’s edge.</p>
<p class="p1">You have the “skills that pay the bills” or you don’t. It’s a loser’s nightmare and a winner’s dream come true.</p>
<p class="p1">Even better, every company on Earth needs effective advertising. You are surrounded by the products and services of various companies right now as you read this—and without effective advertising, you wouldn’t have a single one of those things.</p>
<p>I’ve had clients ranging from dirt-poor (at the beginning of my career) to the multimillionaires I now prefer to work with—and they <em>all</em> need advertising that sells for their companies.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p class="p1">Good ads are the key difference between a company that fails or succeeds—so when you learn to become the provider of the one thing they need most, you become very valuable very quickly… and to a whole lot of people.</p>
<p class="p1">That means endless opportunities that are not limited by geography. Just in the past two weeks, I’ve gotten clients from Canada and the United Kingdom—all while networking with guys in Asia to make money as a team on various projects.</p>
<p class="p1">There is no limit to what you can accomplish with the will to achieve and access to the internet.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>2. I Make My Own Schedule</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96924" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/the-importance-of-sleep_011.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="319"></p>
<p class="p1">Another of my favorite things about copywriting is that there is not one human being on this Earth who gets to dictate how I spend a single second of my day.</p>
<p class="p1">I used to hate waking up earlier than I wanted to, spending 20 minutes in traffic to get somewhere I didn’t want to be in the first place, and then be told by another man how much of MY time I could spend eating lunch.</p>
<p class="p1">I always felt like a slave. It made me depressed, hopeless, and endlessly pessimistic about my own future happiness.</p>
<p class="p1">I know there are people who like to have their lives measured out by someone else simply because it makes things easier for them. Most people are like that. But I’m not one of them, and I don’t think most ROK readers are either.</p>
<p class="p1">Most of the time, I wake up when my body feels ready to wake up. Unless I have a client call scheduled for the morning—which I usually avoid doing—I don’t use an alarm clock at all.</p>
<p class="p1">I then go to the gym or use my awesome bike-desk for 30-60 minutes, make a healthy smoothie, and start working precisely when I feel like it. Then I work and take breaks according to the schedule which best suits me and my own internal rhythm.</p>
<p class="p1">Sometimes I’m still up working at 4 in the morning—so I just wake up at noon the next day to make sure I get 8 hours of sleep. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p class="p1">I can’t be late for anything, because no man besides myself decides my schedule.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>3. I Have As Much Time As I Want To Pursue My Hobbies</strong></h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-73681" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2.jpg" alt="" width="523" height="317" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2.jpg 2100w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2-300x182.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2-1200x729.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2-837x508.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2-667x405.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2-262x159.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Training2-574x349.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px"></p>
<p class="p1">I’m not one of those people who’s going to work 16 hour days for a decade just to “get rich.”</p>
<p class="p1">I’m far more interested in spiritual growth and the expansion of my mind than fancy cars, and so most of my free time is spent studying theology and philosophy. Since being Saved last year from a decade of debauchery and hedonism, I’ve found no worldly task more fulfilling than contemplating (and deepening) my relationship with God.</p>
<p class="p1">I never had time to pursue this line of thought back when I was numbing myself with drugs and sex just to make it another day in Slave World, and it’s added irreplaceable value and comfort to my life.</p>
<p class="p1">I can read books, write articles for my blog, finish client projects, pray, and advance my career all in a comfortable rhythm every day. I have tasted the fruits of freedom, and I will never go back.</p>
<p class="p1">I gave myself three years to build this freedom lifestyle, and I did it in just over two. If I could do it, you can too. But only if you choose to join me.</p>
