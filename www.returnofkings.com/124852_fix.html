<h4>Better than nothing?</h4>

<p>Davecat is living with his wife and their bisexual girlfriend. That might be the dream lifestyle for many, except that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/married-to-a-doll-why-one-man-advocates-synthetic-love/279361/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they’re RealDolls</a> (they’re more lifelike in appearance than store mannequins, but still within “<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/040210-who-is-afraid-of-the-uncanny-valley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uncanny valley</a>” territory). Davecat created elaborate backstories for their relationships. He posts online about their imaginary social life. To his credit, he’s well aware they’re not “organic women”—or to put it more bluntly, they’re not real.</p>
<p>Davecat and others this deep (if you’ll pardon the expression) into silicone girlfriends call themselves iDollators. He hopes one day <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/41767/sex-robots-are-becoming-a-better-option-than-western-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sex robots</a> will take realism to the next level. In case you were wondering, he’s neither a virgin nor a 600-pounder.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s different only in degree from dildos, vibrators, and cucumbers available to women for ages. Although it’s not highest on today’s bizarro-meter, carnal knowledge with a doll just doesn’t appeal to me. Despite my unenthusiasm, I’ll hear him out.</p>
<h4>Why would anyone want to bang dolls?</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-57124" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picard-facepalm-300x197.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="329" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picard-facepalm-300x197.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picard-facepalm-837x551.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picard-facepalm-667x439.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picard-facepalm-262x172.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picard-facepalm-574x378.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/picard-facepalm.jpg 921w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Davecat cites several reasons:</p>
<blockquote><p>A synthetic will never lie to you, cheat on you, criticize you, or be otherwise disagreeable. It’s rare enough to find organics who don’t have something going on with them, and being able to make a partner of one is rarer still.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll concur that finding someone who is compatible, honest, and low-drama isn’t always easy. Still, that’s no reason to give up.</p>
<blockquote><p>…I didn’t ever want to be That Guy Who’s Being Aggressively Persuasive. So instead of asking whatever lass I was with to consider me as a boyfriend, I simply wouldn’t force the issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where do I begin? I need a beer…</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve all seen relationships where things start out fantastically, and then just end up falling apart. A friend of mine just <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114357/how-we-can-fix-the-problem-with-western-marriage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got divorced</a> after 17 years of marriage. That’s an enormous investment of time, money, and emotion, and I’m not interested in having someone in my life who may bail at any time, or who transforms into someone unpleasant. Ultimately, getting romantically involved with an organic woman doesn’t seem worth it to me.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s giving the “glass is half empty” case, but yanno…</p>
<blockquote><p>I was seeing an organic lass—a coworker… Our relationship started out alright, but several months into it, whenever I’d attempt to get together after work with her, she’d always have something come up. I was beating myself up over it when I realized: Why am I wasting my time trying to get her to hang out and be romantically involved with me, when I have a Doll who is in love with me at home? Plus, it was a bit of a contest with said coworker, as she was interested in two other blokes while she was seeing me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, granted, a doll won’t flake on you or put you last in the rotation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then there was the lass I bought a house with back in 2003. I was attempting to help her out of a bad relationship. She claimed to be one of my best friends. She wasn’t the least bit romantically interested in me, but I thought that if I helped her and she and I lived under the same roof, eventually she’d view me more favorably. Turns out that didn’t happen, as I later discovered that she was a pathological liar with a coke addiction, and I moved out of the house after living there for only four months. That really drove home to me that I guess I’m too trusting with some organics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neither do they friend-zone you nor turn into coked-out zombies. During my Blue Pill days, I suffered from both problems, though fortunately not from the same woman.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gynoids and androids… would lack the qualities that make organics difficult to deal with. They would be pleasant, agreeable, non-judgmental, aesthetically and mentally pleasing, and more… The way I see things, your spouse should be easygoing and a joy to come home to… I think the best way to reach that goal is through humanoid robots.</p></blockquote>
<p>Correction, I need <em>two</em> beers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Being in a relationship with a synthetic means that the organic is taking a stand against loneliness on terms which harm no one. Instead of being miserable, they’re doing something about it, without having to waste time, money, and emotion <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/58794/men-are-nothing-more-than-clowns-to-the-modern-woman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing silly games</a> to win the fleeting affections of someone who might be wrong for them in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<p>These are not my choices, though the libertarian argument makes sense here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, it seems easier for women to find an organic male partner than it is for men to find an organic female partner. Women, by and large, are more selective than men are…</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Davecat seems quite game-unaware, but that observation is impossible to miss.</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of men are lonely because they’re misogynist pricks, true, but a lot of other men are lonely because they don’t meet women’s expectations. The latter group may be entirely nice individuals, and would treat their girlfriends extraordinarily well, but they’re shy, or unappealing on some level, or what have you.</p></blockquote>
<p>He has it backwards. Obnoxious assholes are <a href="https://rainbowalbrecht.wordpress.com/2016/07/22/why-some-women-choose-losers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in great demand</a>, defying all logic. Meanwhile, being nicer than warranted (in terms of reciprocal interest you’ve received) will get you shot down. Kindness without previous buy-in is worse than using “Tell me about the lambs, Clarice” for a pickup line. It’s <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/you-did-this-to-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite a bitter irony</a> (though possible to work around) for guys determined to have a social life while remaining decent people.</p>
<h4>Our social environment has gone to hell</h4>

<p><em>Davecat is a man who has given up.</em> He’s found an acceptable (to him) substitute for women. Apparently banging dolls is just a new sexual marketplace safety valve. It’s his life, but this seems a waste of time at best. Although learning game <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/86595/what-to-do-when-youve-been-rejected-so-many-times-that-youre-ready-to-give-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">takes a lot of work</a>, it’s not quite like calculating orbital mechanics on an abacus.</p>
<p>Decades ago, the “iDollators” probably would’ve had regular love lives eventually leading to families. It used to be much easier for ordinary guys to find girlfriends who’d take them seriously and not bust their balls. <em>That’s the tragedy here.</em></p>
<p>Will sex dolls be the next big thing for involuntary celibates? Will this become a <a href="https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2007/08/17/sexbots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disruptive technology</a> for the sexual marketplace? Only time will tell.</p>
<h4>Feminists still don’t get it</h4>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/2FGgHEKko3E.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Some feminists have <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118482" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken notice</a>, and they’re quite displeased (as always). Still, they hardly can argue against the exploitation of plastic objects. Actually, they’re quite guilty of it themselves.</p>
<p>Milo Yiannopoulos had <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/09/16/sexbots-why-women-should-panic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the following to say</a> about this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another reason men might be enthusiastic about female-free sex is obvious: <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/12/09/the-sexodus-part-2-dishonest-feminist-panics-leave-male-sexuality-in-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the sociopathic, man-hating feminism we see so much of on television and in our newspapers today</a> is turning men off dealing with women altogether. Constant whinging about “toxic masculinity,” “manspreading,” “mansplaining,” the bogus gender pay gap and the absurd campus rape culture myth are pushing the sexes apart, fostering mistrust and fear. […]</p>
<p>In response, men are simply checking out, giving up on women and retreating into porn and video games. <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/12/04/the-sexodus-part-1-the-men-giving-up-on-women-and-checking-out-of-society/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I call it the “sexodus,”</a> and its immediate victims aren’t men, but women, who are being consigned to singledom as men lose interest in them or are simply too exhausted or fearful of the social consequences of approaching girls romantically. […]</p>
<p>[M]ost of the reason I went gay is so I didn’t have to deal with nutty broads. Imagine how much worse they’re going to get when the passive aggressive manipulation tactics stop working because the guy can get himself off with a thinner, hotter robot any time he wants to. <em>They’re going to go mental.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. As I’ve suspected, <em>not all gay guys were “born that way”</em>. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/97863/13-signs-that-a-woman-is-toxic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasty attitudes</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/42388/what-its-like-to-date-a-strong-and-independent-woman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princess Complex</a> are creating sexual marketplace safety valves like porn and “escorts”, or even other men and sex dolls.</p>
<p>Really, this should be a wake-up call for feminists. They inflated the price of their precious goodies above sustainability, while <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116535/the-redstockings-manifesto-was-the-blueprint-for-contemporary-feminism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polluting society</a> with their <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/121236/how-modern-feminists-are-not-that-different-from-michael-jackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neurotic</a> hostility. The sooner feminists <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98963/feminism-has-lost-the-minds-of-young-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fade into oblivion</a>, the better for everyone.</p>
