<p>In case you don’t speak Portuguese nor Spanish, the video above is a declaration of love from a girl named Sara Winter to her fiance for a Valentine’s Day Contest promoted by a Brazilian clothing chain, which is celebrated on June 12th in Brazil. It looks like any other Valentine’s Day video: she says he is her best friend; that they are engaged even they know each other for only four months; that she’s leaving behind her family and her company to go to another state, because there’s where her fiance works; and that she made a tattoo because of him and had his name written on her chest through scarifications.</p>
<p>That passionate girl you see in the video was the leader of FEMEN’s Brazilian branch not long ago. Sara Winter is a good example of the kind of woman behind these feminist movements. Ex-prostitute and far right supporter. She supposedly got her pseudonym, or war name, as she likes to call it, from Sarah Winter, a British Nazi supporter during the 30’s and early 40’s.</p>
<p>She got expelled from the group in May, accused of being dishonest and a liar by the Ukrainian branch, because she didn’t use the money FEMEN sent her for their intended purposes, like funding the protests . When asked by a Brazilian journal, Alexandra Shevchenko, FEMEN’s co-founder, said that “Sara didn’t respect the group’s ideology” and that “she wasn’t capable of doing what was necessary and wasn’t ready to be part of FEMEN”. It makes you think how she got there in the first place.</p>
<p>Anyway, now you might be thinking what Sara couldn’t do that cost her position. That was defacing the statue Christ the Redeemer, known as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World. The Ukrainian branch ordered Sara to rent a helicopter to go to the statue and deface it. That’s how serious feminists are about their protests and about what they are capable of doing to get what they want.</p>
<h4>Behind The Protests</h4>

<p>Most of the feminist groups’ leaders are like Sara Winter. They use whatever means they can to be at the commanding position of the local group. They protest seeking “support”, most likely money, from bigger groups and non-governmental organizations, to get attention from media and more importantly, to affiliate with politicians, who sees supporting these groups as a way to get more votes.</p>
<p>That’s the simple reason behind those loud protests: money and power. As leaders, they are the first to touch the money they get from their supporters. And just like Sara did, they take part of the money for themselves.</p>
<p>There are so many feminists groups out there that it’s too hard to know where and with what they are spending that money. That’s why we don’t see many news about feminist leaders using the money with their own things. Unless they spend so much with their things that it gets attention from the media. When that happens, it’s just a matter of time to watch who is going to accuse who, since no one wants a bad reputation to their movement. Just like Alexandra Shevchenko did to Sara.</p>
<h4>After The Fall</h4>
<p>And what should you do when those that you supported turn their backs against you? It’s simple! You turn to you beloved beta husband looking for stability through his money and career as if your past didn’t exist at all. That’s how serious they are about their movements when problems arise.</p>
<p>This kind of behavior may not be new among them, but seeing one of them going from protesting naked in the streets to leaving everything behind to be dependent on her husband made me think, again, how this whole thing they call feminist movement is a lie. It serves no purpose other than gaining money and inverting society’s values and making slutty women look like they’re an ideal catch.</p>
