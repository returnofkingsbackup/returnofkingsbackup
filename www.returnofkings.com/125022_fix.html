<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>The world’s major power blocs represent national interests, religions, and ideologies. They’re like icebergs: partly visible, but mostly beneath the surface. Openness and transparency aren’t exactly core principles!</p>
<h4>Power bloc interactions and internal structures</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-83631" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/puppet-master-1-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/puppet-master-1-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/puppet-master-1-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/puppet-master-1-574x323.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/puppet-master-1.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Individuals can operate within more than one. Power blocs usually have sub-groups, either constructively (alliance-building) or otherwise (<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/118313/the-fault-lines-in-progressive-paradise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excessive factionalism</a>). They can join with one another (and smaller power blocs) toward shared goals, and sometimes one group co-opts another. Consider it like concentric and overlapping circles; things get complicated.</p>
<p>Here are some examples. Secretly funding the Nicaraguan Contras off the books, the CIA sold weaponry to Iran. Worse yet are allegations of playing footsie with <a href="https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2006/12/10/18336493.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dope traffickers</a>, perhaps a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/93777/hillary-and-bill-clinton-are-criminal-masterminds-wielding-incredible-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bipartisan job</a>. Zionist <a href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/category/jewish-ethnic-networking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethnic networking</a> brings together ties to finance, politics, and the press. One result of this synergy was the <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Balfour_Declaration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Balfour Declaration</a>, paving the way for Israel. Leftists are <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/73993/3-things-which-worry-leftists-more-than-global-jihad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">courting Islamists</a> lately (what <em>possibly</em> <a href="https://alternativeeugene.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/why-do-champions-of-liberal-social-causes-support-islam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could go wrong</a>?) Politics makes for strange bedfellows.</p>
<p>Here we’ll describe the modern leftist power structure. Briefly recapping <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/97062/whats-worse-cultural-marxism-or-real-communism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from before</a>, they’re a loose coalition. <strong>The System</strong> drives the agenda. (It’s basically what <a href="http://moldbuggery.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mencius Moldbug</a> called The Cathedral, though this terminology is controversial.) <strong>The Hive</strong> (<a href="http://www.sobran.com/hive/index.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joseph Sobran’s</a> allegory) swarms in orbit around The System and implements their directives. The criteria for System membership are <em>great wealth, great influence, or easy media access</em>.</p>
<p>The following describes their operations within major spheres of influence.</p>
<h3>1. Big Money sphere</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/dOqDM6ypiPk.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who makes its laws.</p>
<p>—Mayer Amschel Rothschild, 1790</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A $350K annual income seems like a decent paycheck. However, any such entry-level “one percenter” barely matters in the power game. One could argue about who <em>really</em> counts: the world’s top thirteen, 300, 2000, or 40,000; the picture is fuzzy. The most notable are banking dynasties, other Old Money families, European nobility, Wall Street executives and international financiers, and New Money tech billionaires. <em>I’m okay with those earning wealth through honest work and who don’t sabotage their society</em>, but I have no use for crooks or champagne Socialists.</p>
<h5><strong>Leftist control</strong></h5>
<p>Globalists are heavily networked internationally. These “citizens of the world” are <a href="https://rainbowalbrecht.wordpress.com/2017/06/02/political-power-structures-past-and-present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">loyal to their wallets</a> rather than their nations, yet many benefit from corporate welfare. Quite ironically, they embrace an ideology about <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/118398/why-sjws-will-never-get-the-world-they-want" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leveling all social distinctions</a> and empowering the downtrodden against the mighty. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114295/what-is-virtue-signalling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It’s debatable</a> how much their meddling is for “the feels”, lust for <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95710/how-a-small-cabal-is-using-socialism-cultural-marxism-to-consolidate-world-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absolute wealth and control</a>, or both. Be it dilettantish naivety, utter cynicism, or hypocritical atonement, either way they’re slowly creating a homogenized one-world banana republic.</p>
<p>They operate through highly secretive groups which critics call the “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/115777/how-the-deep-state-operates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shadow government</a>“. Some are ostensive foreign policy think tanks, though their membership resembles a “who’s who” list of world politics, including several modern American Presidents. Others include overt <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2016/01/the-roots-of-black-lives-matter-unveiled/#!" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advocacy foundations</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/71667/plan-of-global-elites-to-enable-islamic-invasion-of-europe-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">throwing millions</a> to <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/printgroupProfile.asp?grpid=6891" target="_blank" rel="noopener">activism efforts</a> as if tossing Mardi Gras beads.</p>
<p>Media executives exercise top-down control through ownership. Donations to universities likely influence the Education sphere. Their greatest power is in the Government sphere through “campaign contributions”, hedging their bets by donating heavily to both sides. As business owners, they also take measures to influence the cultural environment.</p>
<p>Implementing this at The Hive level, corporate advertising munchkins often piggyback <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/114424/5-superbowl-commercials-that-were-made-to-subvert-american-culture" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sociopolitical messages</a> into their ads, unfortunately a <a href="https://goodbyeamericainaphoto.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common problem</a> lately. Social media companies <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/88292/the-european-union-partners-with-facebook-google-and-twitter-to-censor-hate-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">censor news and opinions</a> Also, HR departments (basically make-work programs for sociology and women’s studies graduates) implement “diversity” initiatives and other feel-good measures. Further, they police politically incorrect viewpoints (likewise flirting at work), depriving offenders of their livelihoods.</p>

<h3>2. Media sphere</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/0hxMaAAmaX0.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<blockquote>
<p>And it could be that while unemployment and the economy worsens, [Donald Trump] could have undermined the messaging so much that he can actually control exactly what people think. And that, that is our job.</p>
<p>—<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-02-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mika Brzezinski</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Centered in New York City and Hollywood, 90% of America’s news and entertainment comes from six mega-conglomerates. (Likely it’s pretty similar elsewhere.) The government—the best politicians money can buy—repealed antitrust provisions meant to prevent this problem. They operate TV networks, newspapers, magazines, radio stations, the literary establishment, the music scene, etc.—even comic books.</p>
<h5><strong>Leftist control</strong></h5>
<p>The System’s propaganda arm is owned by Big Money executives. Other System level types are actors, musicians, anchormen, and notable talking heads. However, it’s often slim pickings in The Hive. I don’t envy entry-level journalists, publishing-house flunkies, starving artists, and D-list actors. The only decent creative profession for those who never make it big are aspiring musicians; even bar bands get groupies.</p>
<p>Outside of the Big Six are other cultural pursuits. The art scene became a circle-jerk between critics and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/103305/why-is-modern-art-so-uninspiring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mediocre artists</a>, generally a leftist boondoggle. Even the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/94032/how-the-porn-industry-uses-psychological-warfare-on-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porn industry</a> can <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/115977/the-hidden-agenda-behind-interracial-pornography" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have agendas</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>Power source</strong></h5>
<p>Being a monopoly on mainstream news provides great power to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98243/confessions-of-a-former-journalist-in-the-corrupt-media-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mold public opinion</a>. Celebrities can share their profound political expertise with the ignorant masses.</p>
<h5><strong>Weaknesses</strong></h5>
<p>The MSM greatly overplayed their hand; they’ve lost more credibility than ever. Conservatives consider them <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/96448/5-examples-of-the-mainstream-medias-extreme-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brazen liars</a>, and <em>even most liberals</em> don’t believe “<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2008/08/17/media-credibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all or most</a>“, much different from <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/101393/the-ugly-truth-of-six-more-leftist-heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Walter Cronkite’s</a> days. The <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/20/degeneracy-what-your-daughter-or-little-sis-listens-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music scene is trashy</a>, and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/87477/how-new-york-killed-male-literature" target="_blank" rel="noopener">literature is dead</a>. The media alienated their audience, which is tuning them out.</p>
<h5><strong>Counterstrategy</strong></h5>

<li>The time is ripe to start building parallel cultural institutions and information networks online.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Education sphere</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Liberating tolerance, then, would mean intolerance against movements from the Right and toleration of movements from the Left. As to the scope of this tolerance and intolerance: … it would extend to the stage of action as well as of discussion and propaganda, of deed as well as of word.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Most children receive state-funded education; quality varies greatly. Then college is promoted as a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/111531/has-higher-education-become-a-scam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ticket to the middle class</a>. System level influencers include the Department of Education, teachers unions, and college presidents.</p>
<p>On The Hive level, professors and the skyrocketing administrative staff have great jobs. Public school teachers are less prestigious, but it’s a decent living if one doesn’t mind dealing with brats.</p>
<h5><strong>Leftist control</strong></h5>
<p>They have a firm grip on most social sciences and humanities departments, and you can forget about working in them unless you talk the talk. <em>(Hint: method-act until tenure.)</em> Academia has become a great make-work program for the young SJWs they indoctrinated. Being the Second Assistant Dean of Diversity is a better gig than Fivebucks Coffee!</p>
<p>Many public school teachers feel they have license to mold young minds before the kiddos can think for themselves. The first time it happened to me was in second grade, and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/111554/todays-youth-are-being-encouraged-to-become-transsexual" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I miss the good old days</a>.</p>
<h5><strong>Power source</strong></h5>
<p>They deliver twelve years of state education, with an optional four year ideological deep-fry, more with <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/law-school-humbug-11925.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">advanced degrees</a>. Indoctrinating generations of kids saved the left from demographic collapse. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/90815/how-the-cultural-marxists-of-the-frankfurt-school-subverted-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Subverting the universities</a> was a shrewd move. Other than that, academia wears the mantle of scholarly respectability. They sometimes develop new ideological <a href="https://rainbowalbrecht.wordpress.com/2016/06/07/deconstructing-the-narrative-of-microaggression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trends</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95854/how-to-fight-politically-correct-language" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buzzwords</a>. They also operate within the psychology sub-sphere.</p>
<h5><strong>Weaknesses</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Members of this “intelligentsia” are often educated beyond their ability to comprehend, unable to defend logically the arguments they’re parroting. (They’re not teaching critical thinking skills, and it shows.) I served my time and greatly resented their constant brainwashing attempts, and now I easily <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116006/the-dysfunction-of-modern-society-is-proof-that-cultural-marxism-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dissect their ideology</a> with glee.</li>
<li>The public increasingly realizes leftist academia is <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/123012/is-your-penis-responsible-for-global-warming" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental masturbation</a>.</li>
<li>Outside of their Ivory Tower, they’re pretty ineffectual. For one example, would you fear a mob of sociology professors?</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Counterstrategy</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Carefully screen schools. Raise hell at PTA meetings and school boards as needed,</li>
<li>Don’t send your children to SJW factories either. Some colleges aren’t pozzed out. Make sure they obtain a worthwhile degree.</li>
<li>Alternatives exist: homeschooling, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/29389/ignore-the-unwarranted-hate-of-trade-jobs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trade schools</a>, and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/42353/how-to-get-a-good-education-without-going-to-college" target="_blank" rel="noopener">self-study</a>.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>The US government’s top levels include the Presidency, Congress, Cabinet members, federal judiciary, department heads, and high military officers. Lobbies work to influence Congress, some quite powerful. They represent multitudes of interests (the military-industrial complex, broccoli farmers, Wall Street, bird watchers, etc.), but you need money to get in that game. State governors also have significant influence.</p>
<p>Things get interesting at The Hive level, down in the swamp! Middle grade bureaucrats wield power in implementing policies. Even the front lines exercise individual discretion: clerks handling your paperwork, IRS agents, and obviously local police. <em>(Hint: pass the “attitude test”.)</em></p>
<h5><strong>Leftist control</strong></h5>
<p>The political circus has much in common with professional wrestling. The Democrats pushed softcore cultural Marxism since the 1960s. Neocon entryism turned the Republicans into a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98814/todays-mainstream-conservatives-only-serve-the-globalist-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controlled opposition</a>. Big Money calls the tune, so they win no matter which party is in power.</p>
<p>Trump is the first Presidential outsider in ages, too rich to be bought off. The party bosses kept trying to sabotage their leading candidate’s campaign. The Democrats didn’t look much better with their dirty primary (and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/93777/hillary-and-bill-clinton-are-criminal-masterminds-wielding-incredible-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dirtier top candidate</a>).</p>
<h5><strong>Power source</strong></h5>

<h5><strong>Weaknesses</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>They’re supposed to practice openness and follow their own rules. When caught with their hand in the cookie jar, significant fallout can happen. With luck, the crook will lose the next election.</li>
<li>Ineptitude, wasteful spending, and hostility to the public are also easy to expose.</li>
<li>Politicians usually lose touch with their constituents, expecting the peasants will remain “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/99001/7-wikileaks-revelations-about-hillary-clinton-that-the-media-is-completely-ignoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unaware and compliant</a>“.</li>

<p>I, too, take a class position. It is anti-capitalist and pro-revolutionary. I believe in non-violent methods of struggle as most effective in the long run for building up successful working class power. Where they cannot be followed or where they are not even permitted by the ruling class, obviously only violent tactics remain. I champion civil liberty as the best of the non-violent means of building the power on which <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/119681/why-communism-doesnt-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workers rule</a> must be based. If I aid the reactionaries to get free speech now and then, if I go outside the class struggle to fight against censorship, it is only because those liberties help to create a more hospitable atmosphere for working class liberties. <em>The class struggle is the central conflict of the world; all others are incidental.</em></p>

<p>Countless organizations represent all viewpoints, single-issue or broad ideologies. These are advocacy groups, think tanks, foundations, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/117839/how-privileged-urban-liberals-profit-from-poverty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGOs</a>, nonprofits, parties (from those running the Government sphere to tiny ones mostly existing in the imagination), etc. Some medium to large organizations have extensive Government connections (influence, lucrative contracts, or even direct policy input). Some have a religious focus but are ultimately political.</p>
<p>They exist to promote their views, gain membership and subscriptions, raise funds, and some are focal points for Activism. <em>Most are okay, even those with disagreeable views</em>; they’re just expressing opinions. Those featuring dishonesty, hidden agendas, no transparency, or dirty tactics are the organizations of concern.</p>
<h5><strong>Leftist control</strong></h5>
<p>Their foundations are another make-work program, employing multitudes from paper pushers up to community agitators. Apparatchiks can move into the Government sphere, as bureaucrats or elected officials.</p>
<p>A few gain celebrity status through recognition and lavish praise from the Media sphere, becoming great leftist heroes. Although those promoted into the power structure’s upper echelons fly above The Hive and ascend into The System, they still must please their Big Money handlers. Not all major Organization heads become big shots (though many dream of it), but a six figure salary isn’t an uncommon consolation. Some are cynical and corrupt enough to make televangelists blush.</p>
<p>Most leftist groups are independent, but several are fronts in the pay of Big Money. Others receive funding from trusts established by Gilded Age donors, lately infiltrated and subverted by entryists. The payback generally involves <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/71667/plan-of-global-elites-to-enable-islamic-invasion-of-europe-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pressuring governments</a>, staging angry demonstrations (sometimes becoming riots), or <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/10/17/exclusive-okeefe-video-sting-exposes-bird-dogging-democrats-effort-to-incite-violence-at-trump-rallies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dirty tricks</a> to discredit opponents. As we saw in 2016, there’s lots of swag to go around; enough to <a href="http://www.weaselzippers.us/224034-more-proof-of-paid-protesters-ad-asking-for-protesters-to-travel-to-protest-list-of-payouts-to-ferguson-protest-organizers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay protesters</a> and bus them in from out of state.</p>
<p>Some groups operate in the legal sphere. This includes alphabet soup “watchdog” outfits that defame dissidents and compile naughty lists, sharing them with law enforcement. (One in particular is a skeezy operation with a skeezier head honcho, using scare tactics to solicit donations.) Others specialize in <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/67436/the-gay-marriage-ruling-why-everyone-loses-but-the-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judicial activism</a> to lawyer up their agendas.</p>
<h5><strong>Power source</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Donations</li>
<li>Popular support (sometimes astroturfing)</li>
<li>Friendly Media coverage</li>
<li>Activism does their ground work</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Weaknesses</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Factionalism and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/118313/the-fault-lines-in-progressive-paradise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ideological clashes</a>
</li>
<li>Ineffectual ones waste time and resources</li>
<li>Sometimes there are too many chiefs and not enough braves</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>Counterstrategy</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>For regular groups that play nice, argue against their positions; standard debate stuff</li>
<li>Expose those using nasty tactics</li>
<li>Report those using illegal tactics</li>
<li>Conduct our own networking</li>
</ul>

<p>It was 1969. Kate [Millett] invited me to join her for a gathering at the home of her friend, Lila Karp. They called the assemblage a “consciousness-raising-group,” a typical communist exercise, something practiced in <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/112921/how-leftist-indoctrination-tactics-resemble-maoist-brainwashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maoist China</a>. We gathered at a large table as the chairperson opened the meeting with a back-and-forth recitation, like a Litany, a type of prayer done in Catholic Church. But now it was Marxism, the Church of the Left, mimicking religious practice…</p>

<p>Here at last are <em>ordinary citizens.</em> Enthusiasm varies, but we’ll include everyone who does more than vote and message friends occasionally. Some might join Organizations; others contribute individually; some operate entirely online. Some work for single issue causes, others go in for several.</p>
<h5><strong>Leftist control</strong></h5>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95449/the-ugly-truth-of-leftist-heroes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenin</a> called liberals “useful idiots”. Deep down, most are nice people concerned about social problems. It’s a shame that so many caring idealists are exploited for donations and hard work by unscrupulous Organizations. They believe they’re championing diversity, fighting for the downtrodden, and opposing a corrupt Establishment. Ironically, they’re being tooled by Big Money types trying to run the world <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/76745/the-end-goal-of-western-progressivism-is-depopulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into the ground</a> for profit while <a href="https://rainbowalbrecht.wordpress.com/2016/07/08/totalitarianism-then-and-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turning the masses</a> into <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/115243/is-genocide-on-the-elite-agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homogenized serfs</a>. It’s hard (but not impossible) to break through their conditioning.</p>
<p>The radicals are a worse category, fanatical and impervious to reason. Sadly, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/89814/7-ways-to-prevent-your-children-from-becoming-sjws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most were good kids</a> before their brains were marinated in Media / Education psyops. Others are recruited from gangs or <a href="https://alternativeeugene.wordpress.com/2017/06/12/antifa-explained-by-insiders-antifa-is-a-shady-cult-for-eugene-style-gutter-punks-antifa-is-a-secretely-funded-cult-preying-on-eugene-style-homeless-youth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the homeless</a>. Unlike liberals, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/119492/antifa-gets-destroyed-by-right-wing-safety-squads-in-berkeley" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these zombies</a> won’t hesitate to vandalize, steal, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/119617/10-essential-tips-for-surviving-an-antifa-riot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">or riot</a> if they think they’ll get away with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-a-social-justice-warrior-sjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Justice Warriors</a> are spayed or neutered radicals, the leftist power structure’s septic tank. These armchair Lenins lack debate skills beyond posting talking points on social media, thinking that actually makes a difference. They can’t comprehend reality, often having <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95868/the-delusional-reality-of-social-justice-warriors-is-a-form-of-mental-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental problems</a>. I’d pity these pathetic dregs if they didn’t engage in <a href="http://www.voxday.net/mart/SJW_Attack_Survival_Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online mobbing</a>, their greatest (only) weapon.</p>

<h5><strong>Weaknesses</strong></h5>

<li>With liberals, you might break through partially by staying reasonable and finding <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/99971/friendly-guide-to-roks-world-view-for-recovering-liberals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common ground</a>.</li>
<li>With radicals, deescalation might work. Also, once I was badly outnumbered, but I deterred them by holding frame.</li>
<li>SJWs are very <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/81933/safe-spaces-on-college-campuses-are-the-new-jim-crow-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak-minded</a> and easy to “trigger”.</li>
<li>Every day, try to do something advancing our agenda.</li>

<p>We’re in a difficult struggle against powerful and highly motivated opponents, but together we can prevail. In general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut off their funding.</li>
<li>Support alternative institutions.</li>
<li>Help spread the word. Many can see that things are going terribly wrong, but haven’t put the pieces together, don’t know what can be done, and feel isolated.</li>
<li>Never give up; defeat is not an option.</li>
