<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>An engineer for Patreon, Aaron Ringgenberg, has publicly come out in support of Antifa, the network of communist-anarchist activists now declared a “domestic terrorist organization.” On June 12, the New Jersey Department for Homeland Security and Preparedness <a href="https://www.njhomelandsecurity.gov/analysis/anarchist-extremists-antifa?rq=antifa">made the categorization</a>, citing the leftist group’s violent activities from New York to California.</p>
<p>Ringgenberg’s Twitter biography, complete with his ready-made gender pronouns, gives us all we need to know about his political preferences (read: biases):</p>
<blockquote><p>I tweet about diversity and inclusion, progressive politics, &amp; funny/cute stuff. He/him.</p></blockquote>
<p>His view of Antifa was not only tolerant but close to laudatory (<strong>before he <em>deleted</em> his tweet</strong>):</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This looks like a great group with a good mission statement. I see no problem. We need active anti-fascist groups in the age of Trump.</p>
<p>— Aaron @Anime Expo LA (@singgenberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/singgenberg/status/881702847242317824">July 3, 2017</a></p>

<p>This should cause serious concerns for anyone who desires proper and peaceful political discourse. What does he mean by “active anti-fascist groups”? And, better yet, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/120706/what-is-fascism">what is a “fascist”</a>? After all, leftists such as Sunsara Taylor, schooled by Tucker Carlson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRA9I8eNjA4">earlier in the year</a>, have put Donald Trump and his supporters in the league of fascists alongside Hitler. With this faulty equation comes the faulty idea that Antifa need to mercilessly attack and potentially kill their ideological opponents.</p>
<p>Shockingly, Antifa incidents at places like the University of California, Berkeley have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvA2wjtKG20">resulted in severe beatings</a> for people whose only “crime” seems to have been standing for free speech, supporting Donald Trump, and/or attending a canceled Milo Yiannopoulos speech.</p>
<p>Whatever “mission statement” an Antifa group puts out, their modus operandi, as Ringgenberg would know, is anonymously assaulting those considered too right-wing. Men like 48-year-old Howard Caplan in Philadelphia this week:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="../i.imgur.com/c5RgQ1R.png" width="379" height="234"></p>
<p>Aaron Ringgenberg’s endorsement of Antifa comes at a strange time for Patreon. The crowdfunding platform has just got into bed with Deray Mckesson, the notorious race-baiter and leader of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/70419/if-black-lives-matter-blacks-need-to-stop-killing-each-other">the putrid Black Lives Matter movement</a>. Not only did Patreon roll out the red carpet for Mckesson recently, it obsequiously thanked him for “spending so much time with us”:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/deray">@deray</a> for stopping by <a href="https://twitter.com/Patreon">@Patreon</a> and spending so much time with us. It was a total honor!</p>

<h3>Which “right wing” users will Patreon ban now?</h3>
<div style="width: 462px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../i.imgur.com/hskKqCo.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="301"><p class="wp-caption-text">SJW-inspired tech companies have started banning the likes of Milo Yiannopoulos, all while turning a blind eye to violent leftists. If they’re going after gay men who hate feminism, what about those of us who support traditional patriarchy?</p>
</div>
<p>We have seen this before with another social media corporation–Twitter. Jack Dorsey’s once innovative company went down the road of supporting and pandering to SJW types. Dorsey himself <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/07/20/twitters-history-censorship-bias/">fawned over Deray Mckesson</a>. Worse still, Anita Sarkeesian, who defines online abuse as merely questioning her positions, was appointed to Twitter’s <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/02/09/twitter-unveils-new-trust-and-safety-council-featuring-feminist-frequency/">“Trust and Safety Council,”</a> a very thinly veiled attempt to impose mass censorship on conservative viewpoints. Even a moderately optimistic reading of the current tech climate will lead many to assume, with justification, that Patreon is likely to follow suit.</p>
<p>As Twitter quickly bowed to fringe leftist activists, truly violent people and groups in the mould of ISIS were <a href="https://www.jihadwatch.org/2016/03/twitter-not-taking-down-isis-accounts-but-banning-users-who-report-terrorists">allowed to maintain accounts</a> with next to no company pushback. The real targets became people with inconvenient, incisive ideologies, including <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2016/07/20/breitbart-bad-boy-milo-not-silenced-by-twitter-ban.html">Milo Yiannopoulos</a>, rather than real-life extremists espousing serious violence. Martin Shkreli, who had already upset the gay community due to his decision to raise the price of an AIDS drug, <a href="http://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/pharma-bro-gets-permanently-banned-from-twitter/news-story/c1c4a7dd0b90ef757a39e68722f37185">faced the Twitter ban-hammer as well</a>, ostensibly for Photoshopping himself into pictures with a feminist journalist. Will Patreon be next in going full mental?</p>
<p>If Aaron Ringgenberg’s employer does not go down the road of culling conservative users, its mere endorsement of leftist extremist groups is bad enough. <em>Return Of Kings</em> and other outlets have catalogued a number of remarkably sinister incidents of late, all involving coordinated and malicious SJW violence. Non-leftist men <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/119637/we-should-thank-emily-rose-nauert-for-scaring-women-off-becoming-sjws">defending themselves from Antifa bottle attacks</a> are labeled “woman-bashers” and Trump supporters are the victims of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBGwrQCv7Pw">Antifa attacks with hard metal objects</a>.</p>
<p>There are astoundingly dark consequences when these actions are not only glossed over, but also promoted through outside support of Antifa organizations. Aaron Ringgenberg should be ashamed.</p>
<h3>Who’s next?</h3>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img src="../i.imgur.com/G5xNct4.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="413"><p class="wp-caption-text">Roosh’s PayPal ban is just a taste of what it is to come from a raft of tech companies. Conservative or simply non-leftist views are firmly in their sights.</p>
</div>
<p>In many ways our readers are our best researchers. To your knowledge, which “unsuitable” users (read: thought criminals) are being kicked off social media or crowdfunding websites? Maybe you are one of them. Roosh, for example, now boasts <a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-62540.html">a lifetime ban from PayPal</a> and he will be the tip of the iceberg before too long. Just as importantly, which employees, like Aaron Ringgenberg, and even executives from tech companies are backing those leftists with the intention of creating true violence?</p>
<p>Aaron Ringgenberg is in all likelihood just one of many overzealous tech workers who hold deep and abiding sympathies for violent leftist groups. Their negative role needs to be closely monitored and, whenever necessary, called out for what it is. Social media and crowdfunding platforms are vital tools for conservative and tradition-minded outlets such as <em>Return Of Kings</em>, which is why we cannot take them for granted. If harnessed for leftist purposes, as they are often are, they can be used against us with terrible and violent results.</p>
