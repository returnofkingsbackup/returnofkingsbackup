<p>Here’s a history nugget you won’t learn anyone else (received via email)…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In reading your <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/766/the-perfect-woman-heels">thoughts on high heels</a>. It dawned on me that you have spoken your opinion in the past on women wearing flip flops. I don’t think your being entirely fair. See….flip flops were brought back by ww2 soldiers and became popular in the 60’s.</p>
<p>The reason they were brought to the U.S. is simple….thoughtful husbands and bitchy wives. The original flip flops were much thinner than those of today. Women used to bitch because standing on the hard kitchen floor cooking all day hurt their feet. Of course being a man we found a solution to this. That solution was flip flops. The space under the stove is small by design because women have small feet and small toes. With flip flops being a slight cushion but still being thin, we gave them comfort while maintaining the toes under the stove cooking process……the way it should be.</p>
<p>The women’s rights movement fucked all that up. Now they wear them everywhere never knowing their intended purpose. I could go on but this is all  entirely bull shit. If one were feeling the desire to elaborate on such a grand story or even add to it. That person would have a defense against flip flop wearing battle ax women. …..also, it really makes the feminists angry.</p>

<p>More <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flops#History">from Wikipedia</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p>There is still a debate over whether this signaled a fundamental change in American culture — <strong>many youth feel that flip-flops are more dressy and can be worn in a variety of social contexts, while older generations feel that wearing them at formal occasions signifies laziness and comfort over style.</strong> In 2011, while vacationing in his native Hawai’i, Barack Obama became the first President of the United States to be photographed wearing a pair of flip-flops. The Dalai Lama of Tibet is also a frequent wearer of flip-flops and has met with several US presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, while wearing the sandals.</p></blockquote>
<p>American men have already had to endure Obama’s parroting of feminist talking points (e.g., <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay">men unfairly make more than woman</a>), but now he’s using his influence to encourage flip flop use. He has gone too far.</p>
