<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>I’d like to share some things I’ve learned about women from the relationships I’ve had. A lot of that experience comes from Eastern European girls, who are more feminine than American girls, but I believe the <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-true-nature-of-women">true nature of women</a> is the same no matter where you go, lurking underneath regardless of outward presentation and behavior.</p>
<h4>1. They lie a lot</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-125605" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pinnochio-768x432.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="306"></p>
<p>Men assert their interests through logic, dominance, and physical strength. Women assert their interests through beauty, guile, and deception. A girl has self-interest in a relationship that may not overlap with yours, and will use her strengths to maintain that interest. Lying is one of the ways she steers the relationship into her desired destination, and this is often done unconsciously to the point where she may actually believe the lies she is telling you.</p>
<p>Girls who are more moral or “good” compared to others can still lie by omission. Because they feel <em>some</em> guilt with bold face lies, they instead craft narratives that leave out damaging facts which may cause her to lose power or standing in the relationship. Lying by omission requires a careful editor within their minds that are meticulous about removing details that can cause problems, especially in their encounters with other men.</p>
<p>For example, imagine a a girl asking her man what he did during the day. He replies, “I ran into a girl I knew today and we had a cup of tea.” He was walking home from work, suddenly recognized a girl he went to college with, popped into a cafe to talk about old friends for twenty minutes, and then gave her a handshake goodbye without any suggestive touching or flirting.</p>
<p>Now imagine a man asking a girl the same question. She replies, “I ran into a guy I knew today and we had a cup of tea.” The event happened in the same way as the man, right? Wrong. What actually happened was an old flame contacted her on Facebook, they exchanged several dozen suggestive messages that included kiss emoticons, he asked her to meet at a specific time in front of a cafe, they went inside and talked for two hours, their legs touched underneath the table, they reminisced about a past drunken hookup, they went for a walk to a nearby lake where more incidental touching happened, and then finally they said goodbye with the guy failing to get a lip kiss and having to settle for a playful grab of her ass.</p>
<p>What she told her boyfriend about the event was not a lie in her mind, but he thinks the event happened in the same way if he recounted it to her. As you can see, asking a girl to narrate an event will not get you close to the truth, because the truth would damage her standing in the relationship. The truth can only be uncovered after asking specific questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>How exactly do you know this guy?</li>
<li>Did you hook up with him in the past?</li>
<li>How long were you at the cafe?</li>
<li>Did he try to touch you?</li>
<li>Where did you go after the cafe?</li>
<li>What exactly did you talk about?</li>
<li>How did he say goodbye to you?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is exhausting for you to perform, but may be prudent if you are suspicious about a certain encounter. If she hesitates at an answer, you are witnessing her editing mechanism at work, and can assume she has gone from lying by omission to outright lying.</p>
<h4>2. They’re time vampires</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125608" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/time-vampire.gif" alt="" width="450" height="172"></p>
<p>The late comic Patrice O’ Neal, who dropped reams of red pill relationship advice <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5A1oA7eJ1s">on the Black Philip Show</a>, called women “time vampires.” He described how for men, the actual sex act is the most pleasurable part of being with a woman, but for a woman, merely having a man spend time on them is the sex. They like being taken out, doted on, entertained, and so on. This explains why they will go on dates with men they don’t even like, because the act of going out and being “hunted” by a man is so extremely validating.</p>
<p>Men just want sex, a bit of intimacy, a companion to eat or watch movies with, and space. Women want sex, cuddling, and endless hours of conversation about nothing important. She wants her man to be a problem solver, psychologist, warrior, and punching bag all in one, and even if you satisfy those needs, she will always want more, because it’s in her nature to keep extracting value.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, a woman finds it impossible to be alone. They’ll spend time with someone they hate, or who they are intensely jealous of, than be alone. A woman rather have a gaggle of gay friends, and hear them constantly talk about butt sex, then watch documentaries or read old books. Their primary fear in life is being alone, something that many men actually desire. A man would not spend time with someone else he dislikes from fear of being alone, because it’s during his alone time that he can recharge his batteries and process his experiences.</p>
<p>When a girl identifies you as a romantic boyfriend, what she really has found is a “time friend,” someone who can now spend dozens of hours a week with her, just so she doesn’t have to be with her own mind. For men who do value their alone time, this causes the bulk of relationship conflicts, but since pussy feels so good, we continue making the sacrifice, as we have been doing for millennia.</p>
<h4>3. They have nothing going on in their lives</h4>
<div id="attachment_125603" style="width: 502px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-125603" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/cupcake-line.jpg" alt="" width="492" height="355"><p class="wp-caption-text">Waiting in line for a little cupcake</p>
</div>
<p>Time vampires need other people’s time because they have nothing going on in their own lives. Men have peculiar interests and hobbies that can occupy them endlessly. I’ve gone days without human contact while working on a particular book project or web site, and didn’t feel particularly pained.</p>
<p>Women don’t have hobbies or interests that are not external projections of how they <em>wish</em> to see themselves. Their primary life interest is men, because only men allow them to construct an image to others of who they want to be seen as: a good girlfriend, a girl in love, a girl who another man greatly desires, a sexy woman, an honorable woman, and so on. The man is a needed accessory in this manipulation, which is why it’s so common for a girl to dive into a long-term relationship, and profess her love for a man, only to cheat on him from the weakest of impulses. The relationship merely serves as validation of how she wants to be seen, not who she really is. The gap between who she wants to be and who she actually is gets taken care of by her advanced rationalization mechanism that prevents her from accepting she is rather clueless and makes grievous mistakes.</p>
<p>It’s her relationships with men that give her definition to her life, because outside of it, she has nothing but Facebook news feeds, Instagram, pop trends, a mind-numbing job, and friends who mainly talk about other men, gossip, text messaging, and feminine hygiene. Besides work, which she pursues partly to have more leverage in her relationships with men by not needing their money (compared to many men who actually enjoy their jobs), she has no identity that she can call her own, no interests to ground her, no passions that are unrelated to men and being seen as attractive by them.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>The above is a nice way of saying the following: if women were judged by how they judge men, they’d be losers. Put a dick on just about any woman you know and watch her instantly transform into a loser, one who is addicted to social media, overpriced restaurants, toxic entertainment, and endless validation from strangers. The biggest male loser is as accomplished, talented, and skilled as the biggest female “winner,” and the only reason very few girls are seen as losers is because they have a pussy, and just about all pussies feel good, regardless of who it’s attached to.</p>
<h4>4. They are unable to perceive their own hypocrisy</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-125604" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hypocrisy.jpg" alt="" width="457" height="319" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hypocrisy.jpg 457w, wp-content/uploads/2017/07/hypocrisy-300x209.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px"></p>
<p>Women will hold you to a standard, at the threat of dumping you if you break it, when she herself is not holding that standard. They do the very things they wouldn’t want you doing, and rationalize it by saying that what she’s doing is actually different, when in all likelihood it’s even worse. They remember every thing you said, even from years ago, but can’t see a behavior they did just last week that contradicts her standards for you.</p>
<p>Women have no objective standard or morality, and thus no way to identify if they are right or wrong about anything. Instead, they use pure emotion to guide their behavior. If they feel good then it must be just. If they feel bad then it must not be. Since emotions can twist the perception of any event, she will simply do what she wants to do and find an emotional path or false strain of logic to convince her it was right.</p>
<p>The most amazing behavior I’ve seen in women is denying something that you caught them doing. You can show them evidence, right to their face, and they will deny it, and then find a way to blame <em>you</em> for it. I have been warned about this before, but was skeptical until I experienced myself. She is such an unreliable “witness” to her own behavior that there may be no point to ever getting an explanation from her about anything. If you don’t know the facts about something, and need her side of the story to get the facts, you’ll never get the facts.</p>
<h4>5. It takes a village to keep a woman monogamous</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-125609" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/village.jpg" alt="" width="533" height="395"></p>
<p>I don’t care how much of an alpha male you are, or how tight your game is, but if you are the <em>only</em> positive influence in your girlfriend or wife’s life, and everything else around her is pushing her to feed her primal need of pleasure, fun, and higher status men, you will get burned. You will not provide an “oasis” of tradition and monogamy if everything else is programming her for feminism and promiscuity. You may be able to keep it together for a few months, a few years, and maybe even a decade, but eventually it will collapse.</p>
<p>I’ve learned that having game is only half of the component to maintaining a healthy relationship. The other half is having her in an environment that tells hers to “cherish your man, be faithful, have children.” Otherwise you will lose. We’re all products of our environment, whether we want to admit it or not, but this impacts women even more because they operate on the consensus of others.</p>
<p>If everyone started jumping off a bridge tomorrow, she would too, because it’s the social proof which convinces her that it’s an activity she would feel good doing. On the other hand, men operate on hierarchy, and we only follow the top dog. If everyone is jumping off the bridge, but our leader doesn’t, we do not jump off the bridge. A man will not follow a crowd of weak men because they are numerous, unlike a woman, who thinks that participating with the majority will make her feel good by lowering her chance of being rejected or ostracized from a group.</p>
<p>For one of my relationships, I tried to create a serene bubble of patriarchy and goodness, and it worked for a while, but eventually I lost out to Facebook, her promiscuous friends, her enabling relatives, and to the degenerate majority. By dating one girl, you date the world around her, and if that world is sick, a negative outcome is inevitable.</p>
<h4>6. Red flags are red for a reason</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-125606" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/red-flag.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="336"></p>
<p>If a girl has done what you consider a red flag, you know she will not be suitable for a long-term relationship. But when you really like a girl, and emotion starts to cloud your logic, you find a way to transform a red flag into a yellow flag. You ignore the advice of your friends, ignore your own instinct, and start looking for insignificant green flags as counterweights to justify the relationship until it all falls apart.</p>
<p>A woman’s actions do not lie. I repeat: <em>a woman’s actions do not lie</em>. Her words are an unreliable witness and must be ignored. The way she acts and behaves is who she is, not what she says. If her actions tell you she’s not quality material, don’t make her a wife. The problem is that men get so caught up in a girl’s beauty and pussy that they actively try to turn the ho or feminist into a housewife.</p>
<p>I can now see the futility in asking a girl how many partners she has been with. You won’t ever get the truth. A girl has the most incentive to lie about this, along with other features of her past, so look at her actions instead. How comfortable with sex is she? How flirtatious was she with you in the beginning? How slutty are her friends? From these observations, you will be able to surmise a number, even if she tries to lie about her actions by playing hard-to-get with you specifically. If a girl couldn’t resist your game, she also can’t resist the game of many other men.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to relationships, my standards are impossibly high, and I will be the first to admit that, but it’s based on the logic of modern relationships and the fact that I don’t want to experience a divorce like my parents did. If a woman marries the wrong man, divorce is easy for her. She gets the children, house, monthly payments, and community support for being so brave. If a man marries the wrong woman, his life is ruined. He gets depression, destitution, suicidal thoughts, and children that are programmed to hate him. Who has to be more careful about any decision to enter a long-term relationship that may result in children?</p>
<p>I have high relationship standards because the stakes are high, so I will use my knowledge of the true nature of women, which I’ve spelled out here, and then use logic to determine which woman may be <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/7-things-i-require-in-the-future-mother-of-my-child">the mother of my children</a>. If I ignore that true nature, I may enjoy bliss for maybe a few years (if I’m lucky) until the hammer comes down on me, and I’m left in a miserable position compared to an ex who is galloping away with my property and children. I’m at the point in my life where I wouldn’t mind having children, but I am also a man who can accept being alone. The latter is surely a better option than being a victim to something I could have predicted would happen.</p>
