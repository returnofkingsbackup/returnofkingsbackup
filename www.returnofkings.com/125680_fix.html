<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>“Coloured” is <a href="https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/in-south-africa-after-apartheid-colored-community-is-the-big-loser/">an inherently ambiguous reference</a>. TV has educated the world into believing that this word is antiquated and therefore racist reference to black Americans. But in other less litigious parts of the globe, it’s a perfectly acceptable demographic category.</p>
<p>In South Africa, the social group identified as coloured is genetically diverse and placed between black and white. As such our historical experience is essentially an instinct to assimilate in either direction, depending on the political atmosphere. Our character can be described as tribalistic and vain. While our values incline us towards individual displays of power through violence.</p>
<p>So how does a coloured South African find his way to the international phenomenon that is Return of Kings? In this article I will clarify the identity, experience, character and values of a racial grey area. Because whether coloureds like it or not, as a group, we must serve some function in the country we inhabit.</p>

<h4>Identity In No Man’s Land</h4>
<p>Apartheid basically attempted to physically separate people on the basis of genotypical (genetic) and phenotypical (observable) features. As offensive as that may be for liberal sensibilities, anthropologists do the same thing intellectually when they observe the natural distinctions between human beings. The fact is that humanity is characterized by biological diversity.</p>
<p>Humans do not form a single genetic population. Racial groups or sub-species (only an offensive word if you are corrupted by political valuations) have their own gene pools. Which determine the various observable physical features. This means that it’s very easy to indicate the different regions of the world various races can trace their origin to. Despite ubiquitous hybridization.</p>
<p>For instance, Mongoloids are phenotypically identifiable by short to medium body length, brown eyes, broad faces and low to medium nose bridges. They can be found mainly in Asia and the Americas. People with Negroid features mainly in Africa, Capoid in Southern Africa and Caucasoid, in Europe, and Western Asia.</p>
<p>Hybrids (mixed genetic ancestry) blur the lines. We exist in a physical and intellectual No Man’s Land. The manifestation of disorder, we are difficult to pinpoint in the world. So without this <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30502963/#.WWTetISGPIU">connection to a primary group identity and location</a> we lack a homemade internal system of moral appraisal. We are indeed the “Other” my South African ID refers to – appraised only by inconsistent external standards.</p>
<h4>Our Historical Experience</h4>
<p>There can be <a href="http://blog.swaliafrica.com/not-black-not-white-meet-the-coloured-people-of-south-africa/">no cohesive history in No Man’s Land</a> so invariably we are left judging all history by whatever modern standard we’ve been educated into giving importance to. Consequently our individual and collective historical experiences are self-centered and negative.</p>
<p>Most of us have the standard self-depreciating personal tale that we hope contributes enough to the liberal narrative to achieve some pitiful payoff. As children we were chased off whites-only public beaches and our parents weren’t served in restaurants. Such apartheid experiences validate the <a href="https://mg.co.za/article/2010-10-13-the-cape-regions-foetal-flaw">poverty, malnutrition and alcoholism</a> prevalent in our low income communities that are oddly well serviced by informal liquor stores and abortion clinics.</p>
<div id="attachment_125682" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-125682" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/FAS.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280"><p class="wp-caption-text">We’ve become forerunners in fetal alcohol syndrome rates. “Women included in the research acknowledged that they were aware that alcohol could detrimentally affect their babies, but they did not care”.</p>
</div>
<p>The No Man’s Land experience is that we will always be exposed to attack from both sides. We were and will never be a group whose interests are prioritized by whichever sub-species achieves power. This, however, does not mean we should be the perpetual victims of a racial hierarchy, always looking to assimilate into the apex group.</p>
<p>It means that without ties to a core group identity, location and history we have the opportunity to develop a truly unique and interesting character. Completely outside the boxes that politics and science has placed everyone else in.</p>

</div>
<h4>The Coloured Character</h4>
<p>No Man’s Land is characterized by tribalism. We are prone to extreme violence, especially in the form of gangsterism. This characteristic is prominent because gangs, much like tribes, appeal to our specific psychology — they guarantee membership and territory.</p>
<div id="attachment_125684" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-125684" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Americans-gang.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Americans-gang.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Americans-gang-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Americans-gang-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">When hungry we become corpses.</p>
</div>
<p>There is however, another often overlooked but fundamental characteristic. A distinct vanity, as you would have noticed by now, embedded in coloured identity and character. It’s that particularly strong vanity, the type that provides refuge throughout years of wounded pride. It’s the thread tying all coloureds together in a common culture. We are unjustifiably vain.</p>
<p>We’ve always been in the middle of the racial hierarchy. Never the good guys or the bad guys. So we have never carried any of the burdens associated with the wealth and power at the top. We’ve also never had to overcome the personal challenges associated with life on the bottom. We’ve never needed to accomplish anything, we haven’t, and we know it.</p>
<p>No goal, no achievement, and no pride. So we collectively remind ourselves about our balanced good looks, lower middle class education and physical capabilities. As if these were important for the collective rather than the individual.</p>
<div id="attachment_125685" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-125685" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Wade-Van-Niekerk.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"><p class="wp-caption-text">When full, we rival Hermes.</p>
</div>
<h4>Core Coloured Values</h4>
<p>Through identity, experience, and character, coloureds seem to have independently developed a Nietzschean philosophy which motivates all our actions and creates our communal circumstance. Anything that increases an individual’s power is deemed good. Anything that decreases it is bad.</p>
<div id="attachment_125686" style="width: 437px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-125686" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Jousting.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="320"><p class="wp-caption-text">An after school power struggle.</p>
</div>
<p>Any action that this fundamental idea motivates is an action to increase individual power. Regardless of whether that action endangers one’s own life. The values are therefore very simple, in any engagement, it would be good to win and bad to have your personal vanity checked. Hence the lack of sympathy a victim of violent crime receives in No Man’s Land.</p>

</div>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>So why, since finding ROK, have I done as much as I can to red pill my brothers? Because the impulse to assimilate is preventing us from changing our circumstance and experience. We are not all going to be effeminate liberal clowns or international sports entertainers. But that doesn’t mean our social activities should be limited to alcohol abuse and savage sword play.</p>
<p>Our out-the-box identity, un-burdened experience, vain cultural character and Nietzschean values are merely lacking an internal moral system. One that can provide a sense of connection to a core group code. This is where social pride comes from—internal motivation, not politics. We need to turn grey filth into gold and I believe ROK has the formula for this type of alchemy.</p>
<p>What we do not need is liberal charity that aims to turn us into socially agreeable, politically valuable, but permanently static pet projects.</p>
