<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>I just spent a month in a second tier Ukrainian city, to determine whether this country would suit me for a long term stay. I passed through there <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/promotion/7-game-principles-i-personally-verified-during-my-trip-to-the-ukraine">last summer</a> and here are my additions on Ukrainian girls for short or long term relationships.</p>
<h3>1. Find the normal girls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-131548" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/street.jpg" alt="" width="401" height="443"></p>
<p>It will take effort to find students and regular women. Try the river banks, campuses, or open markets (rynok/рынок). Leave the centre. The difference between two streets can be huge.</p>
<p>High-end “western” shopping centres exist but are almost empty. Normal people can hang out there but rarely buy.</p>
<p>The girls we are after don’t go to high-end clubs. Avoid the slightly older <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/57571/tag-the-sponsor-exposes-the-depravity-of-modern-women">“sponsor”</a> girls (summoned by rich men) there, who display <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/16837/24-signs-shes-a-slut">universal slut signs</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Be careful not to be played</h3>
<p>Two stories stuck with me. First, a nineteen year-old nine from day game tried to blackmail me into sending her flowers in the mail, even before considering a coffee date.</p>
<div id="attachment_131546" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-131546" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/flower-girl.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="502" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/flower-girl.jpg 457w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/flower-girl-179x300.jpg 179w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Nineteen and already aware of her value. Details follow.</p>
</div>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-131552" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chat-lateral-1.jpg" alt="" width="651" height="473"> <img class="alignnone wp-image-131551" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chat-2-lateral.jpg" alt="" width="649" height="437"></p>
<p>Second, my wingman set up a double date with his attractive target and a grenade for me. They were late arriving and attraction was absent. He set up a second date despite my disagreement. A different grenade with a snapback hat (which I detest) showed up for me with his girl. It was painfully obvious that they feigned interest. Once they ordered cocktails, hookah and sushi, they pretended to go for a smoke and disappeared, leaving us with the bill. My friend managed to bullshit the manager into not making us pay the bill but we learnt our lesson.</p>
<h3>3. Focus on effective game</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-93943" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ukrainian_women_1_23.09.14.jpg-1200x907.jpg" alt="" width="505" height="422"></p>
<p>Online game has average quality and is lower than day game, which yields better results and is less time consuming.</p>
<p>Night game (high-end) has girls that are rarely under their mid-twenties, including hot Dubai girls, career girls, or moms with “ex-husbands.” Dancing with girls without prior interaction is ineffective. Booking a table without a circle is counter-productive. Evgeny, an oligarch we met, said: “Among the girls present, 70% are actual whores. 30% do not do it full time.</p>
<p>For day game, observe the street. There are just more women to approach. Ukraine is day game country.</p>
<h3>4. Appearances matter more</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-131554" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mens-black-suit-watch.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="276"></p>
<p>Looks must be on point, be it clothes, watches, shoes or apartments. My approaches rarely worked when I was heading off to the gym, in short and trainers, regardless of confidence.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>I left the so-so flat I booked upon arrival and upgraded immediately. I knew that girls would have ran away if they had seen it.</p>
<p>The feminine potential is also taken to the max. Even uglier girls could fool you (from far) with toned bodies and impeccable style.</p>
<h3>5. Attraction is obvious if present</h3>
<div id="attachment_131547" style="width: 275px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-131547 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/linge.jpg" alt="" width="265" height="407" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/linge.jpg 843w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/linge-195x300.jpg 195w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/linge-768x1180.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 265px) 100vw, 265px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Post-bang laundry folding</p>
</div>
<p>The girls I slept with took care of me unprompted, preparing food, or doing the washing up. One even mopped the floor. Those are signs of attraction.</p>
<p>My wingman brilliantly redeemed himself with another double date. His girl’s friend, a small brunette with nice curves, and I hit it off right away. Eventually, we called a cab, paid our tab, and respectively took our girls home to be intimate with them them. By combining attraction and paying the bills, an implicit agreement for intimacy took place.</p>
<div id="attachment_131539" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-131539" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brune-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="432" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brune-1.jpg 703w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brune-1-208x300.jpg 208w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Mini brunette</p>
</div>
<p>I later met a beautiful, innocent eighteen year old with braids (my kryptonite). A shame that the attraction was strong but I never managed to set up a second date as I flew home the next morning.</p>
<div id="attachment_131541" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-131541" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cafe-2.png" alt="" width="300" height="500" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cafe-2.png 480w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cafe-2-180x300.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">I had only wheat fields and Viking babies on my mind during that date</p>
</div>
<h3 class="mceTemp">6. Concurrence is rare but fierce</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-131553" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/oloigarch.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="417"></p>
<p>Few high-value males for many high-value females make women compete harder. My Russian coach once said: “JB, we’re Soviet Union, because alcohol, because war, because prison: men little, women a lot.”</p>
<p>The oligarchs, well connected middle-aged men sitting on millions from shady deals, are only a handful so there is enough for everyone.</p>
<p>Foreigners are rare outside of Kiev. Mainly groups of Turks and middle-eastern students, spending their day smoking hookahs in cafes. I only saw them bringing prostitutes (sub-par and in the thirties bracket) up the brand new tower where all the foreigners had short term apartments.</p>
<h4>Ce qu’on en retient</h4>
<p>Forget online game. The street gives varied and numerous options. Do not be afraid to be bold. Display dominance in a non-verbal way. Local girls are into men that lead though aggressive game does not work as well in the FSU as in South America or Asia. Good hunt, brothers.</p>
