<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Earlier this week, the Anti-Defamation League published an article titled “<a href="https://www.adl.org/education/resources/backgrounders/from-alt-right-to-alt-lite-naming-the-hate">From Alt Right to Alt Lite: Naming the Hate</a>,” singling out 36 purported members of each movement—including myself—as “white supremacist” and “neo-Nazi.” The intent of this article isn’t merely to ruin the reputations of those on the list (though given the lack of credence most people give to fake news media outlets these days, that isn’t likely to happen), but to encourage violence against us by left-wing lunatics.</p>
<p>Leftist organizations such as the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center (the latter of which targeted ROK publisher Roosh several years ago) have been using this tactic for years. With the rise of political violence in the U.S. since Donald Trump’s election as president—including an attempted assassination of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise by a Bernie Sanders supporter—the ADL’s libels against me and others in the article represent a real threat to our safety and that of our loved ones.</p>
<h3>Sex, Lies, And Jewish Media Control</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-126300" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abe-foxman.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="282" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abe-foxman.jpg 609w, wp-content/uploads/2017/07/abe-foxman-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Among the most well-known personalities on the ADL’s list are <em>Daily Stormer</em> publisher Andrew Anglin, (((<em>Daily Shoah</em>))) host <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/113075/anti-jewish-owner-of-the-daily-shoah-podcast-mike-enoch-outed-as-having-a-jewish-wife">Mike Enoch</a>, NPI president Richard Spencer, Arktos CEO Daniel Friberg, and Counter.Fund founder Pax Dickinson on the alt right. The alt lite portion of the list includes author and First Amendment attorney Mike Cernovich, “Based Stick Man” Kyle Chapman, radio host and <em>Vice</em> magazine founder Gavin McInnes, and former <em>Breitbart</em> columnist Milo Yiannopoulos, among others.</p>
<p>The piece appears to have been assembled by a poorly-paid intern, because many of its claims are flat-out wrong. For example, <a href="http://mattforney.com/adl-falsely-accusing-holocaust-denier/">the blurb about me falsely claims that I work for alt right media outlet <em>Red Ice</em></a> and attributes one of that site’s videos—an interview with Holocaust revisionist Eric Hunt, which they describe as a “Holocaust denial screed”—to me. The ADL also ignores the fact that <a href="http://mattforney.com/statement-greg-johnson/">I dissociated from the alt right a month ago</a> due to disagreements with the direction of the movement.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, several of the figures accused of being “white supremacist” are not white. For example, <a href="http://voxday.blogspot.hu/2017/07/name-defamatory-jewish-organization.html">Vox Day</a> is part American Indian, Jason Reza Jorjani (editor-in-chief of Arktos) is part Persian, and <a href="https://youtu.be/GT15ZrGJvSA">Tara McCarthy</a> (co-host of the podcast <em>Virtue of the West</em>) is part Indian. This sloppy research underscores how little thought the ADL put into their hit piece.</p>
<h3>Assassination By Proxy</h3>

<p>The ADL published their list with the intent of dividing and conquering the alternative media—<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/124394/alt-lite-and-alt-right-hold-dueling-free-speech-rallies-alt-right-wins">which is already wracked with divisions</a>—as well as singling us out for harassment and violence from left-wingers.</p>

<p>Organizations like the ADL and the SPLC are not news outlets, but exist for the purpose of providing unstable leftists with targets to go after. Assassins have already used dossiers and lists of “hate groups” and “white supremacists” to enact violence against right-wingers; in 2013, <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2013/04/24/frc-shooter-i-targeted-them-because-splc-list-said-they-were-anti-gay/">a mass shooter attacked the Family Research Council</a> after seeing them on an SPLC list of “anti-gay” groups.</p>
<p>Political violence in the U.S. has reached a level not seen since the 1970’s, with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/119602/the-battle-of-berkeley-signals-the-arrival-of-a-true-right-wing-movement">antifas and right-wingers duking it out on the streets of Berkeley</a> and other cities and rhetoric from both sides becoming increasingly violent. Last month, James Hodgkinson, a far-left activist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/14/virginia-shooting-suspect-james-t-hodgkinson-leftwing-activist">attempted to assassinate House Majority Whip Steve Scalise</a> and other House Republicans at a basketball game. He was egged on by the fake news media drumming up hysteria against President Trump and the GOP.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the individuals on the ADL’s hit list have already been the victims of left-wing intimidation and violence. For example, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/113272/man-who-sucker-punched-alt-right-leader-richard-spencer-may-literally-be-a-shit-eating-cuckhold">Richard Spencer was famously punched in the face by an antifa</a> when he attended Trump’s inauguration in January, while <a href="https://youtu.be/x7ue4lSgyHs">journalist Jason Kessler has been harassed and stalked by leftists</a> in his hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>
<p>I myself have been threatened and attacked by antifas in the streets and they’ve also targeted my family in the past. Additionally, since I now live in Europe—where Holocaust denial is a crime in many countries—the ADL’s defamation of me as a Holocaust denier could have legal ramifications for me.</p>
<p>In response to the list, Mike Cernovich and several other alt lite/alt right figures have launched the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADLTerror">#ADLTerror</a> hashtag on Twitter, attempting to bring attention to the ADL’s passive-aggressive attempt to get its enemies harassed or killed.</p>

<p>While some members of the alt right (such as <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardBSpencer/status/887445612312047619">Richard Spencer</a>) have ridiculed the #ADLTerror campaign, the reality of what the ADL is trying to do is no joke. While groups such as the ADL and SPLC have lost much of their credibility as instruments of social shaming, the rising tide of violence against right-wingers cannot be ignored. The ADL’s attempts to attack the alt right and alt lite should be vigorously combated.</p>
