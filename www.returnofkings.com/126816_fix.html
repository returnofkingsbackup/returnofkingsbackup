<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Here at Return of Kings, we aren’t exactly the biggest fans of the <a href="http://www.worldtinderwomen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great flood of women</a> entering the workforce. Every female who takes a relatively well-paid full-time job is accordingly denying another man a reliable income in an era where “jobs for all” is long gone, and yet undeniable truths of the sexual marketplace have not (and will not) ever change.</p>
<p>A man is always going to be willing to date, marry, and have a family with a reasonably attractive woman who is by every definition “unemployed” and almost penniless, but a reasonably attractive woman (and therefore a woman with options) <strong>will not</strong> date, marry, and have a family with an unemployed or broke man.</p>

<img class="wp-image-126859" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9dab0f664e837cecc9d3e98c0f0e8971.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="440" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9dab0f664e837cecc9d3e98c0f0e8971.jpg 400w, wp-content/uploads/2017/07/9dab0f664e837cecc9d3e98c0f0e8971-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Oh she’s so “empowered” and “badass”!</p>
</div>
<p>Nonetheless, if women must be in the workforce for the sake of requiring dual incomes, the least they can do is enter a profession where they are just as fully capable as men in performance standards, and where they are close to guaranteed to be <strong>coming home safely</strong> to their boyfriend, husband, and/or children every night.</p>
<p>Being a police officer is <strong>not</strong> one of those professions. Now for the sake of on-the-job competency, the safety of the public, and offering a greater number of men a (pun intended) shot at employment, this article will elaborate on five reasons why women all over the world should be banned from being cops.</p>
<h3>1. They Are Weak And Go Down Too Easily</h3>
<p>I have touched upon this topic (which in an intelligent world should be relegated to just basic observational and factual science)<b> </b>in several previous articles like “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/33987/anything-women-can-do-men-can-do-better" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anything Women Can Do, Men Can Do Better</a>” and “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/92416/it-doesnt-matter-if-women-win-gold-medals-at-the-rio-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Doesn’t Matter If Women Win Gold Medals At The Rio Olympics</a>“. Women are, without any Marxist drivel or ‘girl power’ rebuttal, <strong>substantially weaker than men</strong> and cannot absorb nearly as much physical punishment or brute force.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/YJs-M5Y4wQM.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In the preceding video, we can see why society is dependent upon capable officers who are the total opposite of this “badass” lady cop. That is, those who can physically hold their own (or for at least <strong>awhile</strong> until a taser or something can be brandished!) against the most commonly encountered wastes of oxygen and taxpayer dimes in any given country.</p>
<p>In the mean urban streets of the United States of America, that waste of oxygen is most likely going to be black, male, young, 6 feet tall, at least 180 pounds, brimming with testosterone and “the ‘tude” (attitude), and packing a big pounds-per-square-inch (P.S.I.) punch or shove. 99% of women in the United States <strong>just can’t handle that</strong>.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/WJeu7-7vUIY.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Meanwhile, while the comparatively far more peaceful New Zealand <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/126317/rok-writer-threatened-with-violence-after-expressing-his-opinion-about-new-zealand-women" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t particularly well known for having the most sensible women</a>, they at least have the sense to send out a police officer who has the strength and physique to get the job done for the task at hand. Well done Kiwis, I guess that rugby culture comes in handy sometimes (for the men).</p>
<h3>2. They Are Lazy, Slow, And Incompetent</h3>
<p>There is a reason why you don’t see many women in comparatively highly paid professions like petroleum engineering, Alaskan crab fishing, or mining. It’s because most women, those who are even just slightly in touch with their natural feminine imperative, are not at all attracted to outdoorsy and physically intensive jobs with no guarantee of perfect weather.</p>
<p>They are naturally inclined to seek out temperature-regulated and comfortable-seating office jobs where gossip, Instagram, and Facebook can occupy half of the “work day” in their mostly vanity (ie. non-essential) employment industry. Accordingly, this natural inclination for inherently lazy and slow-paced work means that being a police officer is not a suitable working environment for women either.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/20SrfEtLDZY.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In an absolutely embarrassing video which was captured in New York City, not one but <strong>two</strong> female police officers are utterly incapable of bringing down a lone black male suspect, all while appearing to be putting in a snails effort to keep pace or chase. The man capturing the video finds this gross incompetence absolutely hysterical. Meanwhile (after we are done laughing too), all we can do is make the face palm gesture.</p>
<h3>3. They Are Too Soft And Easily Scared</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/xRWAsxG4De0.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><em>(1:18) “Obviously he’s a violent hooligan. He’s not that tough though. This refugee, a normal Joe in terms of strength, overpowered the female cops. And it goes to show you just how low the Swedish feminist standards are when they hire police officers.”</em></p>
<p>A video of not one, not two, but <strong>three</strong> female Swedish police officers, failing to subdue a single medium-build hooligan, made the rounds around the world and (for awhile) turned the leftist fantasy land into a laughingstock. While seemingly implausible, it actually makes perfect sense.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Women by nature are far more easily frightened and repulsed in the face of danger (hence you see all three quote-on-quote “police officers” backing away from the suspect after he lands a hard punch or two) and they are often too soft to put up any sustained resistance.</p>
<p>Raising young children is a profession which best utilizes a woman’s softer, delicate, and more nurturing strengths. The OPPOSITE is trying to subdue hostile adult men from an equally hostile culture.</p>
<h3>4. They Are Too Dependent On Male Officers</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/gH70DZKMHuQ.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>A female cops radio dispatcher might as well just be called their “white knight” call box. They are by and large, for any length of time, utterly incapable of doing their job properly without male assistance.</p>
<p>Smaller, weaker, slower, and often just plain lazy, they have to phone in an instant dose of testosterone (competent male cops) in order to see to the end even the most asinine of iffy situations. Like a defiant urban “dindu nuffin” who is not going to put up with getting a citation for riding his bike on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>By proxy, this makes female police officers a huge waste on police resources and their overall efficiency. For every far more capable male officer who has to assist an affirmative-action (female) hire, that is one more male officer who is temporarily taken out of availability in case a <strong>far more serious crime</strong> actually needs attention.</p>
<h3>5. Lives Depend Upon Fully Capable Police Officers – Which Women Are Not</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/PdysW4Pw_SE.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The preceding clip from the 1976 film “The Enforcer” (part of the ‘Dirty Harry’ canon) accurately portrays just what can go wrong when feminist and affirmative action hiring practices infect police departments. An unimposing female law enforcement officer with <strong>no field experience</strong> is being considered for the role of an Inspector, while male officers with 10 or 15 years of real experience are clearly being passed up on the opportunity.</p>
<p>When completely unsuitable women (due to physical weakness, softness, incompetency, too easily scared, lack of experience, etc) are considered for selection for all the wrong reasons (gender quotas &amp; feminist fapping), they will inevitably put the <strong>lives</strong> of the public and their colleagues at risk.</p>
<div id="attachment_126893" style="width: 333px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-126893 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Judge-rejects-delay-appeal-in-Nichols-case.jpg" alt="" width="323" height="450" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Judge-rejects-delay-appeal-in-Nichols-case.jpg 323w, wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Judge-rejects-delay-appeal-in-Nichols-case-215x300.jpg 215w" sizes="(max-width: 323px) 100vw, 323px"><p class="wp-caption-text">The sheriffs deputy who was easily overpowered and beaten into a coma by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Nichols" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Nichols</a> in the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta, Georgia in 2005. The convict then took her gun and escaped custody, leading to four murders / innocent deaths before his eventual recapture. All of those deaths could have been avoided if a larger, stronger, and more capable MALE officer was assigned to watch over the large and imposing suspect.</p>
</div>
<p>Being a beat cop is <strong>serious business. </strong>It is not just some profession where you go <em>“durrrrrpppp, I need a job!”</em> just because you happened to be unemployed and you heard the department was looking for some new street meat.</p>
<p>If you are a heterosexual white male (the most browbeaten and hated creature in the modern United States), you need to be prepared to have everything you do completely filmed, scrutinized, and dissected by the “minorities” (who make up <a href="https://priceonomics.com/the-most-and-least-diverse-cities-in-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50% or more of the population</a> in many large cities) you will be dealing with everyday.</p>
<p>As for women, I’m sorry. 99% of you just don’t have what it takes to deal with the hyper-masculine dregs of society. The <strong>closest societies</strong> in which being a female cop could actually work are places like <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/125492/5-ways-northeast-asian-countries-benefit-from-having-no-diversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Japan, Korea, Taiwan</a>, or Iceland. Even then, women are still second-rate choices.</p>
<h3>Conclusion – Female Cops Should Be Bedroom Sex Fantasies For Men Or Lesbians ONLY</h3>
<div id="attachment_126827" style="width: 276px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-126827" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/missy-peregrym-police-uniform-4.jpg" alt="sexy female cop" width="266" height="427"><p class="wp-caption-text">She can arrest me, strip me down, and “brutalize” me anytime</p>
</div>
<p>Considering how much weaker, slower, softer, lazier, incompetent, scared, and dependent female police officers are compared to men in the same profession, it is a living joke as to why they are even hired in the first place. Since female police officers are living jokes, then the mere idea of female police officers must also be treated as a joke.</p>
<p>Most men’s idea of a fun and joke filled night would include a joyful lovemaking session, which was preceded by our ladies wearing a sexy female “cop” outfit for a bit of whimsical spice. <strong>NOT</strong> receiving a phone call from the intensive-care unit informing us that our never-should-have-been-a-real-cop significant other is bleeding to death through her bullet-riddled police uniform.</p>
<p>Again I will reiterate. For the sake of on-the-job competency in an essential service, and offering far more capable men a chance at steady employment (and therefore a new potential suitor in an era of record low birth rates), women must be banned from becoming police officers. A complete and permanent hiring freeze on women should go into effect in all countries starting immediately.</p>
