<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Tennis bad boy John McEnroe <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/01/serena-williams-john-mcenroe-tennis-gender-championship-equality-sexist">told NPR during an interview</a> that number one female player Serena Williams is the greatest female player of tennis history, but that wasn’t good enough for the feminists. The lady responded by asking why McEnroe said the word female, and not just say she’s the greatest tennis player of all time. John then told them that would be a whole different topic and responded,  “…if she played on the men’s circuit she’d be like 700 in the world.”</p>
<p>The media went ballistic, hammering John during a CBS interview demanding an apology, but he didn’t give them what they want. Instead he gave common sense logic which the goons couldn’t accept.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/hDPK8ds1D-o.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Professional tennis has two divisions, ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) and the WTA (Women’s Tennis Association). So when talking about players, of course you have to mention gender, because there are multiple divisions. You can’t just make general claims.</p>
<p>To end the controversy, John suggested what I and many other tennis fans, have always wanted for years: let men and woman play on the same tour. Then all female players will have to prove themselves.</p>
<p>Serena evaded with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear John I respect you but please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based. I’ve never played anyone ranked ‘there’ nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I’m trying to have a baby. Good day sir.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked how he would be ranked on the men’s tour, John made it clear at 58 years of age and to play 5 setters instead of 3 like on the women’s side, he’d be about 1200<sup>th</sup> in the world. He admitted that at his tennis academy in Long Island, he has lost many times to teen high school players, and older pros.</p>
<h3>John Previously Said He Could Take Her<img class="alignnone wp-image-127011 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/jonny.jpeg" alt="" width="504" height="346">
</h3>
<p>John even said on Jimmy Kimmel that he felt he could still take her out in a match. He mentioned Donald Trump made an offer to see it happen, but it wasn’t enough to get it going so he wasn’t sure if he was joking or if it could actually be scheduled.</p>

<p>McEnroe also asked why this is only an issue in tennis, not basketball or other sports? Nobody thinks any female baller compares to Michael Jordan so is tennis the only sport crucified?</p>
<h3>What The Men’s Tour Is Like</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/whesnCQ-ye8.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Tennis is very demanding sport, at least on the men’s side. You’ve got to be fit, fast like hell, and strong to generate power in tight spots. It’s not like other sports where you can just power your way, run your way, or pay off your way to the championships. It truly is the independent man’s sport.</p>
<p>You’ve also got to be smart with quick reflexes to think on your feet within seconds or less. Forget the skinny guy stereotype. On the pro tour, and even at colleges and clubs, you see a lot of tall wiry but ripped players. Single digit body fat percentages are not uncommon, and fitness is usually the big thing that separates the players from amateurs. Control is another, but this is not a tennis lesson.</p>
<p>What about the WTA?</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/h2G-Uiz6PxQ.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The game is much slower and to be frank, boring. Just listening to awkward screams and yelling. As you can see, the men’s game is much faster compared to the WTA. The ball is struck harder, and a much higher fitness level is required. Too many poor guys ranked higher than 30th in the world are struggling to make bread while the WTA pays millions to women with average skill compared to the men.</p>
<h3>What Would Happen If The ATP Played WTA?</h3>
<p>It would go like this (keep in mind these are not even high ranking male players):</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/UcprxDdAdeE.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>If the men were playing seriously in a real match, not charity, 90% of the serves will go unreturned. The WTA won’t be able to handle it; they’ll be blown off the court in an hour or less and that’s only because the men have to win best of five sets.</p>
<p class="watch-title-container"><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title" dir="ltr" title="[HD] Martina Navratilova vs Jimmy Connors - Highlights">Martina Navratilova vs Jimmy Connors drew in big crowds back in the day, but Connors ended it in straight sets. All players in the WTA would suffer the same fate against the ATP.<br>
</span></p>
<p>Serena likes to think she can beat the top 200th player, but to be honest, I could probably beat her even though I’m not pro as are MANY other college players. I could give her a run for her money simply because I know I’m quicker, stronger, and can pace the ball much faster than what she’s used to.</p>
<p>For the men’s circuit, that’s another story. Let’s just say I need more training, but Serena, or anybody else from the female tour, no problem.</p>
<p>If I were a betting man, I’d put my money on any top college or state ranked high school player against her any day, or even elite club players for that matter. Those guys are good, they’ll smack the ball at 120mph right in your face.</p>
<p>McEnroe said it best: abolish the WTA, make it one pro unit, then will see just how well the women do. I applaud his tell-it-like-it-is statements. Even at his age, he’s still got more guts and testosterone than 95% of the “yes ma’am” knuckleheads in the the media.</p>
