<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Every civilization is judge on what it produces for the world. One way of doing this is by listening to the kind of music a nation creates. The Western world used to produce some fine music over the past couple decades whether it being from America, England, or other modern nations. However, today it has declined to a shameful level.</p>
<h3>50’s Music</h3>
<p><strong>Dave Brubeck – Take Five</strong></p>
<p>A man’s skill in wielding an instrument was the true measure of his musical genius back the. Listen to the drum solo in this song…</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/vmDDOFXSgAs%3Flist=PLRE7VDjvMjyrTf9uHFITc9Ho3QE1Q8Mm5.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><b>Bill Haley &amp; His Comets – Rock Around The Clock (1955)</b></p>
<p>A well-loved classic. The standard was very simple in those times: if you were not truly exceptional at playing an instrument and had great a voice, you were out.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/ZgdufzXvjqw.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Frankie Avalon – Venus (1959)</strong></p>
<p>Might not want to try this on girls, don’t think you’ll get the same response today. Get some tattoos and gold plated teeth and try rapping while “making it rain.”</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/fakpqLDEQAo.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>The 60’s</h3>
<p><strong>Glen Campbell – Wichita Lineman (1968)</strong></p>
<p>I know this may come as a shock for you millennial viewers, but yes there actually were classy descent looking well-groomed men who sang in proper English. This is the kind of music that helped soldiers get through hard times while touching people’s hearts.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/4qoymGCDYzU.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Andy Williams and Marcos Valle – The Andy Williams Show (1967)</strong></p>
<p>Brazil was becoming famous back then in the States mainly because of its young musicians creating music like this.</p>
<p>Feminists you need to watch this. Your hatred for men is very misguided. Such passionate music is created from the fire that burns in a man for the love of women, not because they want to suppress you.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/HgKS8uO_qHs.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="watch-title-container"><span class="watch-title" dir="ltr" title="Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66 - Wichita Lineman (1969)"><strong>Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil ’66 – </strong></span><strong><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title" dir="ltr" title="SERGIO MENDES - YE ME LE">YE ME LE </span></strong><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title" dir="ltr" title="Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66 - Wichita Lineman (1969)"><strong>(1969)</strong></span></p>
<p>Bossa Nova really took off and it’s not surprising when you listen to it. One of my favorite genres.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/1GQ8YfYyFwM.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>70’s Music, Let The Party Begin</h3>
<p>Oh come on Mr. Luthra, we need something we can dance to. Sure thing – enter the 70’s. Disco took off with songs like this…</p>
<p class="watch-title-container"><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title" dir="ltr" title="Machine . . . There But for the Grace of God, There Go I"><strong>Machine – There But for the Grace of God (1977)</strong></span></p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/o_lPHjn0Aqk%3Flist=PLRE7VDjvMjyocDd4j-u9Eq3EqpWrTItdC.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<div id="content" class=" content-alignment" role="main">
<p>A common expression used to describe music was “it has soul”. This was not just in old school Cuban and Salsa music, but all genres seemed to have that heart, that extra kick that today’s music is severely lacking.</p>
<p><strong>Bee Gees – Night Fever (1977)</strong></p>
<p>This song was popularized in the film Saturday Night Fever with John Travolta. Yes, I know it’s hard to believe, but there was time when Americans were slim. They also didn’t need to drench themselves in alcohol either to have a good time.</p>

<h3>Music From The 80’s</h3>
<p><strong>Living in a Box – Living in a Box (1987)<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Manly guys dressed in suits with manly voices. There’s passion, energy, and that extra spunk that gives it that magic like quality to it even though the song is about something not very pleasant. You don’t see handsome musicians with such talent nowadays who know how to work the stage.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/guBsPkUkPQg.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Pep Boys -West End Girls (1987)</strong></p>
<p>This is what was considered classic pop back then, about as close to Justin Bieber as you could ever get. Good English music, shame that they produce stuff like this anymore.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/p3j2NYZ8FKs.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Paul Hardcastle – Rain Forest (1985)</strong></p>
<p>Smooth jazz was also popular then. They didn’t need to smoke pot or do drugs, at least not at the epidemic level that it is today. Instead that had this kind of music.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/qRXFHmsVn78.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p class="watch-title-container"><strong><span id="eow-title" class="watch-title" dir="ltr" title="Was (Not Was) - Walk The Dinosaur (HD 16:9)">Was (Not Was) – Walk The Dinosaur </span>(1988)</strong></p>
<p>Yea you had dancing with girls, but it good clean fun, no one is twerking or doing any other degrading behavior. You had blacks having a good time with whites, with better relations than what we have today. Black music wasn’t all just bling, rappers, and twerking bikinis.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/83nFiPoSuzU.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>What Love Songs Were Like</h3>
<p>For starters, they were actually about love and had emotion, the kind that every real man is seeking in a woman. Say what you want about it, but it’s still better that the free love promiscuous message that is promoted in today’s music.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/9zajb74cGWQ.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Or you could dance to it like they did in the 90’s.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/zQX2q6WCrbE.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3>Music Today (if that’s what you call it)</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-16644" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Miley-Cyrus-performance-at-MTV-VMA-2013-2223059.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="750"></p>
<p>Feminized garbage sung by emasculated men that are so talent-less they need big butt babes, million dollar mansions, and other various props desperately trying to hold your attention.</p>
<p>Just go on the YouTube homepage and scroll through the first couple of promoted videos for trash that has no meaning or rhythm. This is why the Muslim Brotherhood is so hell bent on destroying Western civilization. They don’t want their daughters ended up like this, and with the continued feminization of Western society, they might succeed if people don’t man up.</p>
<p>Fortunately some of the greats are still alive and are still during music tours like Marcos Valle who performed in Moscow. Russians are known for being calm reserved people who don’t easily show emotion, but even they went wild after hearing such great music as art is universal.</p>

<p>You can also check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC466w_gu_aWLbJtR3r5IiQg">my playlists on YouTube,</a> it’s work in progress. Thank God for the internet, anyone can instantly access great music from the past. There are some good musicians out there today, but they are not promoted nor given the attention they deserve due to the music/industrial complex.</p>
