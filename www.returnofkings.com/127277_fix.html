<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>With the year coming to an end, many are trying to make sense of all that happened in 2017. Questions like “Where is God?” circled through people’s heads as many wondered how could a benevolent force allow such horrors on earth. Political parties still continue to sell their pitch and point fingers out each other. Greed dominates with corruption, reeking from White House all the way down, and many have lost their way by being brainwashed with feminism, PC, and passiveness.</p>
<p>While there isn’t a one sentence rational explanation for all this, the Vedas has a different answer…</p>
<h3><strong>We’re Living In An Age Of Darkness</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-109560 " src="wp-content/uploads/2016/12/dark-city-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="277"></p>
<p>In Hinduism, there are cycles of spiritual evolution that earth goes through. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Satya Yuga</strong> –  Golden Age, basically utopia where there’s no old age or starvation</li>
<li>
<strong>Treta Yuga</strong> – Third Age, virtue diminishes slightly, birth of emperors and war</li>
<li>
<strong>Dvapara Yuga</strong>– Siseases rampant, and loss of ancestral knowledge creates hysteria</li>
<li>
<strong>Kali Yuga</strong> – Dark Age, ignorance, filth, lies, very low life spans</li>
</ul>
<p>Guess which one we’re currently in according to the Vedas? That’s right, Kali Yuga! Now it all makes sense doesn’t it? The Bible and other religious texts say the same: we are living in an era where everything is upside down, where the materialistic culture reigns supreme.</p>
<h3><strong>What Is Kali Yuga?<br>
</strong></h3>
<p>It is the Dark Age, where man degenerates and moves far away from God. Dharma (morality) becomes nonexistent, and civilization loses itself in indulgence. The ancient world describes it as the age where the moral character of man is low and that lies, cheating, deceit, and corruption take over the earth. Those whom you would think are supposed to be good are now evil.</p>
<p>Scholars calculated that this era began about 3000 BCE. The good news is that after Kali Yuga, Satya Yuga follows, The Golden Age. The bad news is that it’s not going to come for several thousands of years. Predictions of Kali Yuga in Vedas were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dangerous rulers who raise taxes and see themselves as superior rather than protectors of society</li>
<li>Mass migration to other lands where food is available</li>
<li>No sense of God or spirituality will exist with fake saints, all ancestral knowledge is gone</li>
<li>Lust, ignorance, animosity towards people, and murder without reason</li>
<li>People will laugh, criticize, and attack those who are spiritual</li>
<li>Krishna, the Hindu God, foretells extreme hardship of those with ideals and higher ambitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Now it is easy to blow this off as nonsense, but the prophecies have found their modern equivalents…</p>
<h3>A World With No Reason Or Logic</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-144696 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/cellphone-addiction-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="365" height="322"></p>
<p>More and more people are completely lost in consumer addiction, constantly on their phones searching for answers. Materialistic comforts have become a means to an end, and people no longer judge you on who you are, but rather what you are, your profession.</p>
<h5><strong>Higher Divorce Rates</strong></h5>
<p>Women are no longer interested in being supportive wives, but want global attention. Men are not judged for their faithfulness and character, but for only what’s in their bank account. Marriage rates and down and men in Western nations are sexually frustrated thanks to the anti-sexual harassment movement and the push on women to be career minded.</p>
<h5><strong>False Idols</strong></h5>
<p>Silicon Men commonly found in <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/127762/the-silicone-men-of-silicon-valley">Silicon Valley</a> have followers converting to trans-humanism, the unspoken religion that forces technology on you even if you live on the ranch and don’t need it. God has been replaced by superheroes, celebrities, politicians, and tech giant. Trans-humanism is spreading like a virus, secretly implanting the belief you are not worthy and that only technology can save you from your “sin”—being normal.</p>
<p>Additionally, you have anointed “holy men” who lecture America to take care of immigrants while they themselves put walls on their borders.</p>

<h5><strong>Attacks against those with solutions</strong></h5>
<p>Individuals and groups who speak out against the corrupt establishment are viciously attacked by the media and rogue agents online. ROK itself has faced violent aggression from those who pretend to be peaceful and for social justice. People have been <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/142757/theresa-may-officially-bans-roosh-from-the-uk-while-terrorist-sympathizers-are-let-in">banned from nations</a> for simply expressing their views while terrorists are welcomed.</p>

<h5><strong>Lies</strong></h5>
<p>It doesn’t stop at the media. There’s fake news and fake science, fake politicians, and even fake people. And the illusions don’t necessarily come from words, but from life itself. People go to school expecting education, but get indoctrination and political correctness. People vote for candidates who promise change, but they end up being more of the same. People go to doctors to be cured, but only get drugs. People go to the grocery to buy food, but get heavily processed synthetics.</p>
<h5><strong>Globalism</strong></h5>
<p>There’s nowhere to escape from the one universal religion of the world where everyone believes the false preaching of the globalists. While they may not openly announce their intentions directly, they want to micromanage everyone’s lives. The government issues higher taxes on the middle class trapping them in a prison, yet they use loopholes to dodge them. They want you to believe that they know what is best for you, and that you’re inferior, because you are not a billionaire tycoon.</p>
<h3>How To Protect Yourself From Kali Yuga</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-26062" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Shiva.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="441"></p>
<p>When Shiva’s wife asked what can people do in this era, Shiva said he will reappear and create a new space, a new center of religion and a new state of mind where man can find God. Japa (prayer), meditation, and yoga are recommended, but be careful as yoga has been turned into a pop culture of the downward dog pose.</p>
<p>Shiva can also mean the masculine energy, and with more alternative online spaces like ROK appearing, perhaps his invisible presence is on earth.</p>
<h3><strong>How The Gods Dealt With Evil In The Past<br>
</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-127928 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Shivas-Rudra-Roop.jpg" alt="" width="534" height="315" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Shivas-Rudra-Roop.jpg 534w, wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Shivas-Rudra-Roop-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px"></p>
<p>Many westerners falsely believe that the gods of Hinduism were passive. Nothing could be further from the truth. Demons were destroyed by their swords, not balloons like in England.</p>
<p>Vishnu, The Preserver, incarnated on earth nearly ten times in multiple forms to destroy many kinds of evil. According to the Vedas, it is his job to preserve the earth during times of extreme suffering. He beheaded demon kings and defeated their armies.</p>

<p>As the world continues to devolve, the system many once believed in is now falling apart. If <a href="http://donaldtrumpvstheglobalists.com/">Donald Trump wants to save America and Western civilization</a>, he must begin by turning the tide and stopping the evil before it gains control of every aspect of our lives.</p>
