<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I grew up in the Church of England (aka Anglicanism), a church that, among other heresies, permits female ordination and <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/canadian-anglicans-approval-of-same-sex-marriage-far-from-unanimous">gay marriage</a>. This is perhaps unsurprising given the Church’s speckled past; King Henry VIII’s sinful polygamy caused England’s 1534 split with the Church of Rome.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_127385" style="width: 486px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-127385" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Proud-Anglicans.jpg" alt="" width="476" height="294" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Proud-Anglicans.jpg 810w, wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Proud-Anglicans-300x185.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Proud-Anglicans-768x474.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Because it’s [insert current year]! God will understand.</p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The creeping influence of secular leftism has not only penetrated the Anglican Church. In response to Donald Trump’s moderate immigration stance, Pope Francis condemned Christians who turn away refugees, and <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3397429/pope-francis-refugee-concentration-camps/">likened</a> refugee-holding centres to ‘concentration camps.’ This, of course, is a straw man: no moral person, Christian or otherwise, argues for turning away <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/819670/Migrant-crisis-EU-admits-hardly-any-people-arriving-Italy-refugees-deportations"><i>legitimate</i></a> asylum seekers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While these developments are troubling, they occur because, at their core, Christian parents produce <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/9782/why-christian-men-dont-deserve-virgins">beta boys </a>and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/11/03/red-sex-blue-sex">slutty girls</a> who do <i>not</i> mimic Christ’s image. Until I swallowed the red pill, I was very much in the former category. I have, thankfully, renounced the Church of England, while maintaining my Christian faith. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before I enumerate the reasons that Christian families create such poisonous qualities in their offspring, I start with a disclaimer for men: in no way should this prevent you from marrying a proper Christian girl. However, you need to know how to sort the sheep from the wolves – a skill that only game bestows. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Biblical monogamy is misinterpreted</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In St. Paul’s letter to the Ephesians, verse 5:35, it is written,</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Husbands love your wives, as Christ also loved the church.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This verse has frequently been interpreted to mean that, in effect, husbands should bend over backwards to please their nagging wives – Jesus, after all, died for us ungrateful sinners! Thus many a Christian man becomes slave to his spouse, licking the ground she treads upon. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, St. Paul’s advice to women, in Ephesians 5:22, is conveniently ignored: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div id="attachment_9414" style="width: 328px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-9414 " src="wp-content/uploads/2013/04/vintage_housewife_cook.jpg" alt="" width="318" height="362"><p class="wp-caption-text">Harken to a better time.</p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In other words, women are not natural leaders in the household, and should always be subservient to their husbands. They should always strive to respect, adore, and obey their men. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Husbands should, of course, love their wives, but the Biblical meaning of ‘love’ has been diluted by cheap romantic literature and Hollywood fairytales. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pO8iYfS6JGY">Christian theology</a>, to ‘love’ is to ‘will the good of the other.’ Thus, loving someone means sometimes exerting a strong guiding hand, steering that person away from harm, even if that person does not appreciate it at the time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For instance, I know of a Christian guy who allowed his wife to go clubbing with her girlfriends. As any red pilled man knows, this means she is getting bored of her marriage, and is seeking outside excitement (i.e. sex with an alpha). Clearly, both wife and husband were not living according to St. Paul’s Biblical dictates. Allowing your wife to walk around unguided is tantamount to Adam’s original sin: allowing Eve to wander around the Garden of Eden, stumbling upon the luring Serpent. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Forgiveness excuses promiscuity</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Young women, like men, have high sex drives. The difference is that sex, for women, is easy to procure, especially if a girl lives in a city. </span></p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Many conservative girls, brought up in a religious household, have a job or schooling that takes her into the big city from which she derives sex, drugs, and SJW brainwashing. That old joke about Catholic schoolgirls – that their repressed sex drive finds abundant outlets after high school – rings true. My supremely devout Catholic friend raised a daughter who now has feminist tattoos defiling her otherwise beautiful body.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_72735" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-72735" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Schoolgirl-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="337" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Schoolgirl-300x211.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Schoolgirl-262x184.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Schoolgirl.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"><p class="wp-caption-text">A typical Catholic schoolgirl</p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The girls always excuse their behaviour by saying something to the effect of, “Oh, it’s alright, God will forgive me later!” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While Christ’s forgiveness is supreme, and we often stumble in our Christian journey, such forgiveness does not imply permissiveness. St. Paul repeatedly asks us to turn away from sin, so that we might strengthen our relationship with Jesus. As his letter to the Romans reminds us, </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sin is not to be sought, and while I myself have been guilty of falling back into a pattern of sin, I have recognized and taken steps to remedy my path. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Christians praise beta behavior</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If sex is easy for women to procure, it is hard for men. We have to hunt; in other words, to <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/day-bang">learn game</a>. I know Christian men who claim that they are ‘waiting until marriage,’ but it really is not their choice – no quality girl would voluntarily sleep with them. They excuse their lazy behaviour by claiming that they are leaving it in God’s hands. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And they are enabled in this attitude by bad Christian pastors, many of whom are beta boys themselves. Take, for instance, this video from LifeTeen, a Catholic youth ministry: </span></p>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/08qvr3JexQA%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I cringed, to say the least. The advice is: be intentional, become her friend, don’t text her, get to know her, etc. Although some of this advice is good (“Be okay with rejection”), the rest is laughable. Once we understand girls’ true nature: they prefer ambiguity to intention, will never have sex with friend-zoned guys, and favour text-messaging to other modes of communication.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sadly, this advice, and worse, is representative across Christian denominations. Such repressing of a male’s core sexual instincts is detrimental to Christian men, who often find themselves marrying a slut who has tired of the cock carousel.<br>
</span></p>

</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Is it any wonder, then, that our churches have become so cuckolded? We, as Christians, are raising beta boys and loose women. Such creatures are natural prey to SJWs and liberals, who only seek to defile and destroy Christianity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While I do not subscribe to all of alt-Christianity’s tenets, ROK contributor Damian Michael is correct: <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/121341/the-myth-that-jesus-christ-was-not-masculine">Jesus Christ was a masculine man</a>. He was fully God, but also fully human, and therefore 100% man. We, as a Church, should seek to reflect Christ’s godliness and humanity in our lives. To do otherwise is the Devil’s influence, and contrary to natural and godly law. </span></p>
