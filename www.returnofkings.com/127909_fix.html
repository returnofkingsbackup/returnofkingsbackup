<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A Google engineer has been fired after circulating a 10-page ‘Anti-Diversity’ memo. James Damore, a published <a href="http://sysbiophd.harvard.edu/people/alumni/james-damore">Ivy League biologist</a>, wrote the tract, <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf"><i>Google’s Ideological Echo Chamber</i></a>, which challenges the organization’s gender equity policies and political correctness. He currently plans to sue Google for wrongful termination.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This story’s frightening aspect is that Damore’s views are centrist, and hardly controversial. While acknowledging that ‘discrimination’ can cause gender disparities, Damore argues that biology also plays a role. Among other empirical findings, women display more agreeableness, and higher neuroticism, than men, and are thus better suited to certain careers. He then goes on, in his memo, to suggest methods to create gender parity, with these biologically-based traits in mind. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For this ignominy, he was chastised by Google’s senior brass. Vice President of Diversity, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/faf746c0-7abb-11e7-9108-edda0bcbc928">Danielle Brown</a>, crafted an emotional diatribe against Damore, and Chief Executive (white knight) <a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/memo-on-women-crossed-line-offensive-google-ceo-sundar-pichai/articleshow/59974544.cms">Sundar Pichai</a> told employees that Damore had perpetrated ‘harmful gender stereotypes.’ If anything, Google’s actions only confirm Damore’s worst fears, that “Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture,” in which free expression is punished. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Never mind that Google does not practice what it preaches – <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/6/29/15896690/google-diversity-report-2017-for-2016-more-latinos-more-women-leadership">20 percent of its technical workers are women, and 35 percent are Asian</a>. This, of course, makes sense for a profit-maximizing company, but the SJW mantra must be ceaselessly chanted from the rooftops nonetheless. What is worrying is that a moderate and scientifically based memo can instigate a witch-hunt. Yet there is a silver lining to this: we, in the right, can cultivate centrist allies, as the left increasingly alienates people. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Biological Evidence</b></span></h4>
<div id="attachment_100530" style="width: 470px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-100530" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/11/soldier-girl-ar15-600x338-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="259" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/11/soldier-girl-ar15-600x338-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/soldier-girl-ar15-600x338-262x148.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/soldier-girl-ar15-600x338-574x323.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/11/soldier-girl-ar15-600x338.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Of course Instagram whores should fight in wars!</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Testosterone is a fundamental male hormone, which is why ROK readers are encouraged to get blood flowing through their testicles: lifting weights, cold approaching girls, and training martial arts. Testosterone determines behaviour and choices. <a href="https://www.returnofkings.com/126196/6-stages-a-man-goes-through-when-his-testosterone-level-declines">Low-T men turn into beta losers</a>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is therefore unsurprising that testosterone determines career choices. For instance, in research published in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/106/36/15268.full"><i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i></a>, scientists found that “individuals high in testosterone… were more likely to choose risky careers in finance.” It is easy to surmise, from this alone, that high-T men will easily out-earn women. Indeed, women born with abnormally high testosterone levels are <a href="https://www.livescience.com/16086-sex-hormones-influence-career-choices.html">more likely to choose traditionally male careers</a>, like pilot or computer scientist. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Men are attracted to careers which require working with objects and ideas, while women want jobs which involve social interaction (wasting half their day on social media). The former, which involves hard skills like computer programming or woodworking, earns more than the latter. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When four psychologists were asked to respond to Damore’s assertions, <a href="http://quillette.com/2017/08/07/google-memo-four-scientists-respond/">they all agreed with him</a>. Indeed, Debra W. Soh said:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a woman who’s worked in academia and within STEM, I didn’t find the memo offensive or sexist in the least…</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Within the field of neuroscience, sex differences between women and men—when it comes to brain structure and function and associated differences in personality and occupational preferences—are understood to be true, because the evidence for them (thousands of studies) is strong. This is not information that’s considered controversial or up for debate; if you tried to argue otherwise, or for purely social influences, you’d be laughed at.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That sexual differences cause differences in career choices should therefore come as no surprise. This is simply science. What is shocking is Google’s reaction. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>The Narrative and Its Adherents</b></span></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-111688" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/01/globalism-604x270-300x134.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="271"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Women’s comparative advantage is to be mothers and homemakers. For 99% of women, their time is better spent raising healthy, balanced children, than engaging in cubicle-slavery, alcoholism, and promiscuity. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Yet the dominant globalist narrative is that women are equivalent to men, in every facet of their being. The purpose of this is threefold:</span></p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">To destroy the family. Doing so dissolves individuals’ support structures, and makes them depend on the government and corporations. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">To ensure that women compete against men, hence lowering everyone’s wages. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">To destroy Western culture, which is premised on appropriate gender roles. Destroying the culture encourages hedonism and rampant consumerism. </span></li>
</ol>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whether or not the globalists actually believe these tenets is irrelevant, since it serves their purpose. The point is they have thus far been successful. Damore’s sin was to question the idea that we are separate from our genes. </span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Silver Lining</b></span></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-124391" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/06/fight-club-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="474" height="359"></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">James Damore is not the only centrist to have suffered for his opinions. Homosexual liberal Dave Rubin’s views on Islam caused his YouTube revenues to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4D0TBPd3JU">drop by 60%</a>. Other controversial YouTubers, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQVMnW6LGfM">PewDiePie </a>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nngC2C8Zus4">Entrepreneurs in Cars</a>, have suffered similar fates from YouTube’s demonetization. Jordan Peterson, the acclaimed Canadian psychologist, whose views are centre-right at most, <a href="http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/an-opportunity-to-make-their-displeasure-known-government-pulls-funding-of-pronoun-professor/wcm/bec80705-ae5b-41c2-8260-1aa0e90e5a7f">was denied government research money</a>. Popular UCLA law professor Keith Fink was <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/06/29/conservative-ucla-lecturer-i-was-let-go-for-purely-political-reasons/">fired for his supposedly conservative opinions</a>. I could go on. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is a silver lining: the left is persecuting moderates. We, as right-wing men, should therefore seek strategic alliances with useful centrists, especially those who have a large audience and/or are in positions of authority. Roosh <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-dissident-right-cant-win-without-parallel-institutions">wisely warned</a> that we cannot win without parallel institutions; a possible tactic is to cautiously ally with moderates in creating separate universities, media, and think tanks. </span></p>
