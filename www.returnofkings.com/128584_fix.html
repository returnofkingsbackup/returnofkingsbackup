<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>As the fallout from <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/128371/charlottesville-was-a-disaster-for-the-dissident-right">the failed Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia</a> last weekend continues, leftist-controlled tech and social media outlets have started mass censoring right-wingers and banning them from their platforms. While sites such as Twitter have been hostile to the right for a long time, the events in Charlottesville—<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/us/james-alex-fields-charlottesville-driver-.html">where alt-left agitator Heather Heyer was killed by rally attendee James Alex Fields, Jr.</a>—have given leftist-run sites the excuse they need to ideologically cleanse their websites.</p>
<p>As of this writing, numerous right-wing websites and personalities have been banned from PayPal, Twitter, Paypal, Stripe, Facebook, Instagram, Mailchimp, Soundcloud, Uber, and countless other platforms. To make matters worse, domain registrars and website maintenance companies such as CloudFlare and GoDaddy have no-platformed <em>The Daily Stormer,</em> keeping the site offline since Sunday. It’s clear that ideological dissidents are going to have to change their tactics in order to keep their websites and other platforms online.</p>
<h3>Dozens have been purged</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/128275/unite-the-right-rally-in-charlottesville-shut-down-by-city-government-and-their-violent-leftist-allies">Even before the Charlottesville rally</a>, right-wingers had been targeted for no-platforming by leftist-converged social media and financial platforms. Since Donald Trump’s election, we’ve witnessed a flurry of attacks from Silicon Valley, from the mass demonetization of politically dissident YouTube videos to the banning of individuals such as <a href="http://www.occidentaldissent.com/2017/05/01/paypal-censors-occidental-dissent/">Hunter Wallace</a>, <a href="http://www.staresattheworld.com/2016/09/paypal-joining-google-twitter-censorship-war/">Davis Aurini</a>, and ROK publisher Roosh Valizadeh <a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-62540.html">from PayPal</a>.</p>
<p>In the lead up to Unite the Right, <a href="http://www.dailywire.com/news/19508/airbnb-deletes-accounts-cancels-bookings-far-right-james-barrett">Airbnb began cancelling the accounts of right-wingers</a> that it suspected were renting apartments in Charlottesville to attend the rally. On the day of the rally itself, <a href="https://youtu.be/uWF5i0qvf3Q">alt-right media outlet <em>Red Ice</em> was hacked by antifas</a>, along with the personal Twitter accounts of hosts Henrik Palmgren and Lana Lokteff; the site is still offline. <a href="https://archive.fo/eQKdq">Baked Alaska and James Allsup were also banned from Uber</a> after they were kicked out by their driver for supposedly being “racist.” This was all a prelude to what came next.</p>
<p>The first wave of the assault on right-wingers came on Sunday, when several of the major rally attendees, including Pax Dickinson, Mike Enoch, and <a href="https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2017/08/twitter-selective-censorship-continues-with-pol-news-forever/37267/">Levi Smith</a>, were banned from Twitter. Dickinson’s ban came not long after <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/14/heres-how-the-virginia-state-police-provoked-violence-at-charlottesville/">he revealed how local police had deliberately set up the rally attendees to be overwhelmed and attacked by antifas</a>.</p>

<p>Over the next few days, PayPal and Facebook <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paypal-charlottesville-hate-groups_us_59949563e4b0acc593e4ac94">announced a major crackdown on right-wingers</a>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16147782/facebook-mark-zuckerberg-charlottesville-neo-nazis-violent-threats">Facebook has banned the pages and personal accounts of numerous right-wing personalities and sites</a>, including <em>American Renaissance, </em>Christopher Cantwell, Pax Dickinson, and the Traditionalist Worker Party. PayPal has also banned Cantwell, Richard Spencer, Jason Kessler, <em>American Renaissance, VDARE, </em>and countless others from using their services, cutting them off from a vital source of funds. In the latter two cases, AmRen and VDARE were banned even though <a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/vdare-com-editor-peter-brimelow-on-the-cancellation-of-our-colorado-conference">neither they nor their leadership had any involvement with Unite the Right</a>.</p>

<p><script async src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Additionally, Mailchimp has purged numerous right-wingers from using its mailing list services, including Christopher Cantwell and Pax Dickinson’s Counter.Fund. Cantwell was also banned from YouTube permanently and <a href="https://christophercantwell.com/2017/08/17/charlottesville-aftermath/">may be completely ruined due to his involvement in Unite the Right</a>. Discord has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/technology/discord-chat-app-alt-right.html">banned alt-right servers</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>To make matters worse, leftists have begun attacking web hosts, domain registrars, and other infrastructural services that right-wingers rely on to keep their sites online. <a href="https://twitter.com/RootbocksDotCom/status/897508534493085697">Rootbocks</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hatreon/status/897942524056092672">Hatreon</a>, two free-speech alternatives to GoFundMe and Patreon, respectively, have been forced to switch domains and webhosts after being banned due to their unwillingness to ban right-wingers. Free speech Twitter replacement Gab has been subjected to several DDoS attacks for the same reasons, and the <em><a href="https://alternative-right.blogspot.com/">Alternative Right</a></em> blog was deleted from Blogger last night.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the largest DDoS attack against Gab in our existence. <br>Happening on our one year anniversary. <br>Only propelling our message.</p>

<p><script async src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>But no site has suffered as much as <em>The Daily Stormer.</em> After they published an article on Sunday mocking Heather Heyer, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/godaddy-ceo-we-booted-the-neo-nazi-daily-stormer-website-for-inciting-violence.html">they were forced off their domain registrar GoDaddy after alt-leftists complained</a>. They switched to Google Domains, only to have their domain seized in violation of Google’s terms of service. <em>The Daily Stormer</em> is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150668/daily-stormer-alt-right-dark-web-site-godaddy-google-ban">currently only available on the deep web</a> and may not be able to return to normal operations.</p>
<p>What’s astounding is that alt-left-controlled tech organizations aren’t even hiding their desire to purge right-wing organizations. For example, anti-DDoS service CloudFlare banned <em>The Daily Stormer</em> solely because their CEO woke up in a “bad mood,” <a href="https://archive.fo/WOEZZ">which he admitted in a company-wide email</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me be clear: this was an arbitrary decision. It was different than what I’d talked talked with our senior team about yesterday. I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet. I called our legal team and told them what we were going to do. I called our Trust &amp; Safety team and had them stop the service. It was a decision I could make because I’m the CEO of a major Internet infrastructure company.</p></blockquote>
<p>The purge has swelled to the point that Lauren Southern—who is completely unaffiliated with the alt-right and was not present at Charlottesville—<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/4254509/instagram-apologises-for-suspending-alt-right-figurehead-lauren-southern-for-posting-pictures-of-a-tubby-hedgehog/">was nearly banned from Instagram</a>, despite her account there being completely apolitical. As Hamish’s Tweet above shows, these are far from the only examples of right-wingers being purged, no-platformed, censored, or merely harassed. Others, such as <em>Social Matter’s</em> <a href="http://www.socialmatter.net/2017/08/15/weimerica-weekly-episode-83-charlottesville/">Ryan Landry</a> and <em>AltRight.com/</em>Arktos’ <a href="https://jasonrezajorjani.com/blog/2017/8/15/my-resignation-from-the-alt-right">Jason Reza Jorjani</a>, have chosen to leave the alt-right altogether.</p>
<h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>

<p><script async src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>While the purge of right-wingers from mainstream financial and social media platforms appears to be slowing down somewhat, it is clear that the right can no longer rely on these services to promote or finance their operations. The fact that previously neutral platforms such as domain registrars and DDoS protection systems such as CloudFlare are also booting right-wingers is a chilling development, because it means that alt-tech platforms such as Gab, Rootbocks, and Hatreon are at risk of being no-platformed as well.</p>
<p>While I believe that nationalism will ultimately triumph over globalism, it is clear that right-wingers will need to take drastic measures in order to safeguard their First Amendment rights. In addition to minimizing or eliminating their dependence on mainstream platforms, right-wingers will also need to eliminate their use of Nazi imagery—even as a joke—and tone down their criticism of Jews. Much like how Roosh was able to maintain his relevance despite no longer being able to talk about rape, the dissident right can maintain its relevance without turning into Hollywood Nazis.</p>
<p>Additionally, the dissident right cannot look to President Trump for protection from the alt-left. While Trump has made his displeasure at the alt-left publicly known, his lack of action against them—and against the no-platforming of his right-wing supporters—indicates that he either doesn’t understand the problem or doesn’t care. For the moment at least, we are on our own.</p>
