<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Peace and grace to you all from the Lord Jesus Christ. I hope that, in these trying times, you are able to find some semblance of optimism and joy.</p>
<p>This past week was particularly difficult for those of us in the United States who hold the First Amendment in high esteem, and it can be very difficult to maintain hope when it seems like our nation is crashing down around us. And yet, the spring of living water does not ever stop flowing, and in Him we may find the security for which we seek and strive.</p>
<p>As most of the audience is probably aware, part of the New World Order’s plan for global government also calls for global religion. This one-world religion, with its foundation in such books as Alice Bailey’s <a href="http://amzn.to/2fWQeAA">Externalization Of The Hierarchy</a>, can sound appealing at first glance. After all, the idea of everyone living together in harmony—worshiping God and treating our neighbors well regardless of our upbringing—is certainly a pleasant thought to entertain.</p>
<p>However, there is more going on than meets the eye, and in today’s article, I’d like to address the topic of spiritual warfare and expose a bit of the enemy’s playbook. It is important (and often difficult) to remember that in our dealing with political enemies, we are not actually competing against human beings.</p>
<p>Paul writes in Ephesians 6:12, “<em>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.”</em></p>

<img class="wp-image-128622" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jesusvssatan.jpg" alt="" width="492" height="303"><p class="wp-caption-text">This is the only war that matters.</p>
</div>
<p>It’s as true today as it was 2,000 years ago that spirits use human beings as vessels by which to carry out their will. In the case of the demonic spirits which animate the enemies of God and truth, there is a relatively small number of ways by which they can enter a human being and subvert that human’s will in order to carry out their own agenda.</p>
<p>I’m only going to discuss one of those ways today, but first I must define what the enemy’s agenda actually <em>is</em>. Keeping in mind that all demonic spirits are simply minions of the enemy, their goal is to manifest Hell on Earth. They desire power and control, and they feed on chaos and pain. The more chaos and pain they can cause in human affairs, the stronger they become and the worse things get for us in the physical realm.</p>
<p>The one and only thing in their way of complete dominion of the physical realm is the group of human beings who are “<em>spiritually sealed”</em> against their influence by the blood of Christ. This being the case, demonic spirits know that their best chance for becoming manifest on Earth is to draw the minds and hearts of human beings away from Jesus Christ. With that accomplished, it is a very easy task for them to subtly take control.</p>
<p>Therefore, they disguise themselves in a number of ways in order to achieve this end. They do not simply show up as demons and tell you to let them in, as this would “<em>give away the game</em>.” Instead, they promise <em>equality, liberty, fraternity</em> and other lies which sound inspiring but lead to destruction. As Paul writes in 2 Corinthians 11:14, “<em>Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.”</em></p>

<p>In a sense, the enemy tells the same lie today as he did in the beginning: “<em>I’m here to make you powerful and free!” </em>He told Eve she would “<em>become like God</em>,” and that’s not so different from some of his many forms even today. Remember that these spirits have been around far longer than human beings. As such, they know all of our weaknesses and temptations both as a species and individually.</p>
<p>Therefore, you may be sure that Satan will take the form most personally appealing to <em>you</em> when he’s trying to pull you away from Christ. For many people in the modern world, they want to believe in “<em>diversity, inclusivity,</em> <em>and tolerance</em>.” One of his favorite tricks in today’s culture is trying to put all religions on “equal footing.” People inspired by the enemy’s minions will tell you “<em>it’s all the same</em>,” “<em>it all leads to the same place</em>,” or perhaps the classic “<em>one Light, many paths</em>.”</p>
<p>I was deceived by this for a long time myself, so I know quite well how seductive these ideas can sound. But in the end, they are lies. The people spreading them don’t consciously realize they’re lying—and very likely believe they are on the right side of history—but that’s because their minds have been twisted and tricked by the spirits possessing and using them.</p>
<p>If demons can get people to believe that all religions lead to the same place, all it does is weaken belief in Christ as the only means by which to be sealed against them. It’s not a complicated trick, it’s just a very subtle one. As to whether there’s any truth to the “equality” of all these different belief systems, Christ Himself already answered that question. He tells us in John 14:6, “<em>I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</em>” All who have been Born-Again know the absolute truth and power of this statement. Those not sealed against demonic influence are easy targets, and it is against these easy targets that we are currently fighting.</p>
<p>If you want to win this war, realize it will not be won on the ground. As you <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/128584/night-of-the-digital-knives-silicon-valley-launches-biggest-internet-censorship-purge-in-history">have seen this week</a>, the enemy has all the money and temporal power. Instead, realize that the spirits animating our political enemies are powerless against the blood of Christ and His spiritual soldiers. By believing in the Gospel and sealing yourself against demonic influence, you become one less puppet of the enemy and one more point of power by which the angels may operate. Remember that the Enemy does not need worship to win; he only needs you <em>not</em> to worship God.</p>
<p>Outside of the New Testament, my highest book recommendation for making yourself into a soldier of God is the Jack Sparks translation of <a href="http://amzn.to/2vPNj26">Victory In The Unseen Warfare</a>. It is simple, straightforward, powerful and transformative.</p>
<p>The more people across Planet Earth are sealed by the blood of Christ, the fewer portals wicked spirits can use to enter our realm. That is why the Enemy’s single greatest fear is a united global Christian Church, by which I mean no more than a united body of believers in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>So to wrap up today’s essay, allow me to answer the original question of “<em>What’s so bad about a global religion?” </em>The answer is “<em>nothing.</em>” So long as it’s the one that Jesus Christ preached.</p>
