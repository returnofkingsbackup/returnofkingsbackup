<p>One of my favorite movies is the Matrix.  That comes as no surprise as it is widely known as a great movie and a pioneer in the concept of how people perceive their worlds.  And as we all know, its concept of blue pill/red pill is arguably the backbone of this website and other mansophere based sites.  But there is one particular scene that I absolutely love in that movie, and try to remind myself of it often:</p>
<h4>“There Is No Spoon”</h4>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/YXKFTzlBziI.html" height="225" width="400" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Spoon boy</b>: Do not try and bend the spoon. That’s impossible. Instead… only try to realize the truth.</p>
<p><b>Neo</b>: What truth?</p>
<p><b>Spoon boy</b>: There is no spoon.</p>
<p><b>Neo</b>: There is no spoon?</p>
<p><b>Spoon boy</b>: Then you’ll see, that it is not the spoon that bends, it is only yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the basic premise of the entire movie.  Once you realize that the limitations you believe exist are only in your mind, then you can do anything because those limitations actually do not exist.  Now obviously you cannot defy the laws of physics by flying or have 100% success by pulling threesomes cold on a nightly basis (or in this case, actually bending a spoon with your mind).  But its amazing what you can actually do if you take yourself out of the mindset that “x” is not possible.</p>
<h4>Application To Women</h4>
<p>I am hardly pioneering any new thoughts or creating any new ideas.  I can just relate my own experience as I had many limiting beliefs before.  Lots of them have been shattered in the past few years alone, as I spent more time in the red pill world.  Such as that one night stands are pure luck.  Wrong.  They are a result of some luck, but also developing a systematic approach to reach this goal involving <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/11991/what-effort-looks-like" target="_blank">hours</a> of practice, logistics, screening and so forth.</p>

<p>I’ve also had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with some fellow ROK writers.  For example, McQueen was met with hesitation about his 4 bangs in 30 hours <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/11698/4-bangs-in-30-hours" target="_blank">article</a>.  Some thought it was bullshit.  Three years ago I would not think that was possible absent celebrity status.  But if you meet the guy, he operates in a totally different reality.  I can never sustain that type of energy and being a lawyer does not surround you with hot drunk women like his job does.  When you actually see his attitude in play in that kind of setting, you quickly go from skeptical to impressed.</p>
<p>I can definitively credit my last Vegas <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8157/the-easiest-city-in-the-world-to-get-laid" target="_blank">success</a> partly to Emmanuel’s unrivaled <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8777/real-men-dont-wait-for-a-yes" target="_blank">aggressiveness</a> in kissing a girl quickly upon meeting.  Having seen him do it many times before, at that moment in Vegas I went for it within seconds of meeting the girl.  It worked.  Again, something I did not previously think was possible, much less successful.  Now I do it a lot more often.</p>
<p>One cool thing you can try at home — next time you are on a date with a girl just don’t answer some of her questions.  Literally don’t respond to a question you don’t want to, be silent and then start a new conversational thread.  You’ll be amazed that more than half the time she won’t even inquire as to why you never answered her.</p>
<h4><strong> Application To Life</strong></h4>
<p>I am still being exposed to these applications of the no spoon reality.  I have a friend who went from unable to keeping any job to being on the verge of becoming a multimillionaire.  In college I saw a tiny thin guy rendering a massive man immobile with a self-defense move.  Basically things you see in movies and do not think is possible.  But it happens everyday.</p>
<p>A very educated guess would be that most of you reading this site have had several realities shattered in the past.  Every time I see something with my own eyes that I previously thought was “impossible” I get a huge rush.  I’m very excited to have my realities continue to be shattered in the future.</p>
