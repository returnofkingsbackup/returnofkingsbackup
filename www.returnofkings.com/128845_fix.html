<p>Found on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1gesjp/how_many_women_does_it_take_to_screw_in_a/?st=j6k3c75i&amp;sh=cdd2ebc8">Q: How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?</a></p>
<p>A: It’s actually 12: One to screw it in, one to excoriate men for creating the need for illumination, one to blame men for inventing such a faulty means of illumination, one to suggest the whole “screwing” bit to be too “rape-like”, one to deconstruct the lightbulb itself as being phallic, one to blame men for not changing the bulb, one to blame men for trying to change the bulb instead of letting a woman do it, one to blame men for creating a society that discourages women from changing light bulbs, one to blame men for creating a society where women change too many light bulbs, one to advocate that lightbulb changers should have wage parity with electricians, one to alert the media that women are now “out-light bulbing” men, and one to just sit there taking pictures for her blog for photo-evidence that men are unnecessary.</p>

<p>A number of years ago I read a small book what is similar to the title of this article. The exact title of the book is, <a href="http://amzn.to/2wkbaYA">If You’re Riding a Horse and It Dies, Get Off</a>, by Jim Grant and Char Forsten.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-128846" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Cutest-Beating-Dead-Horse-GIF.gif" alt="" width="412" height="372"></p>
<h4>Proposed solutions to ride a dead horse successfully</h4>
<p>Grant and Forsten give some proposed solutions to the problem of a dead horse not going anywhere. All of the proposed solutions simply deny the horse is dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe a bigger whip will help.</li>
<li>Use an electric prod.</li>
<li>Visit some schools that are successfully riding dead horses.</li>
<li>Try a more experienced rider.</li>
<li>Assemble a committee to study dead horses.</li>
<li>Testing the horse.</li>
<li>More federal assistance.</li>
<li>Give the rider a competency test.</li>
<li>Try team riding.</li>
<li>Categorically denying there is anything wrong with a dead horse.</li>
<li>Evaluate the horse’s reputation.</li>
<li>The horse is lazy.</li>
<li>Raise the standard for riding dead horses.</li>
<li>Adding an additional saddle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the idea of the dead horse can be compared to many things, for the purposes of this article the dead horse is progressive ideology. Western civilization has been sick for many decades and is becoming sicker. The diseases of multiculturalism, feminism, diversity pandering, and emasculation of men are killing the horse of Western civilization.</p>
<p>Compare the list of proposed solutions of riding a dead horse to the problems and proposed solutions in Western civilization. Most business leaders, politicians, and most academics advocate that the societal diseases in Western civilization are good and preferable. I have yet to encounter a progressive snowflake that does not believe in the supposed virtues of the previously mentioned societal diseases. Progressives are telling people that cancer is a good thing.</p>
<p>Any ideas contrary or people opposed to these societal diseases are treated as a problem. These diseases create illusioned societal hysteria. Those that believe in these societal diseases see sexism, racism, homophobia, weightism, and about every other ism they can conjure out of their butt holes. <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/10/fat-studies-is-now-a-social-justice-issue-according-to-oregon-state-university-professor/">Oregon State University</a> is offering “<a href="http://clashdaily.com/2017/08/fresh-bs-fat-studies-class-deems-weightism-social-justice-issue/">Fat Studies</a>”. We are seeing colleges offering courses on <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/08/11/stanford-students-to-examine-abolishing-whiteness/">problems with being white</a>. Additional examples are the ideas of <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2014/12/22/what-is-manspreading-and-why-are-people-angry-about-it/">manspreading</a> or <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/11/16/sweden-launches-mansplaining-hotline-tackle-workplace-oppression/">mansplaining</a>.</p>

<h4>Catering to the weak-minded</h4>
<p>Our businesses, political leaders, and academic institutions are catering to the weak-minded, the progressive snowflakes (which melt under the slightest pressure or heat) in our culture. The weak-minded are easily influenced by emotion and the straw-man arguments pushed by progressives and the global establishment. Progressive snowflakes will not acknowledge their own shortcomings, failures, and weak-mindedness. Instead they look for problems that are minimal in scope, do not exist at all, or were never problems in the first place (such as the “wage gap”).</p>
<p>The weak-minded are easily controlled by those seeking for power. Obama and Clinton both pandered to the weak-minded. They offered “solutions” similar to what is advocated by those in the book. Instead of acknowledging the horse is dead (the problem does not exist or individual shortcomings), they push a narrative that appeals to those that desire no responsibility and want to externalize their personal issues, stupidity, and laziness on other people, typically men.</p>

<p>Peter Theil, one of the founders of PayPal, discusses in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6cxRYgqfHY">a video on YouTube</a> how people begin to see things that do not exist or blow things out of proportion. Feminists begin to see lamp poles, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-07/female-traffic-light-signals-melbourne-pedestrian-crossing/8330560">traffic signals</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bic-charges-more-for-pens-targeted-at-women-2012-8">pens</a> and <a href="https://www.someecards.com/news/women/for-her-pencils-sexist/">pencils</a>, <a href="https://www.theodysseyonline.com/how-many-feminists-does-take-change-light-bulb">light bulbs</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNH0bmYT7os">air conditioning</a>, <a href="https://www.thelocal.se/20161112/stockholm-transport-heads-defends-gender-equal-snow-clearing">snow plowed streets</a>, and hockey sticks as “symbols” and “signs” of female “oppression”.

<p>The divisions will be continually and deliberately exploited by the global establishment to destroy the remaining foundation and framework of Western civilization. There are <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/02/10/venezuelans-killing-flamingos-and-anteaters-to-stave-off-hunger-amid-mounting-food-crisis.html">people in Venezuela eating dogs</a> and going through the garbage while here there are people more concerned about having sex changes.</p>
<h4>Actions</h4>
<p>The horse of Western civilization is not dead yet, but we must work to save its framework and foundation. First, pick your battles. A lot of energy and resources are spent on fighting and arguments. When progressive snowflakes engage others that disagree with them about their disastrous ideology, they have a sense of accomplishment. Constantly engaging such people is a waste of time and energy. Progressives will be further divided and we are seeing them begin to fight among themselves. Be aware of where your time, money, and other resources go.</p>
<p>When engaged by progressive snowflakes, turn the tables or ask for details and control your emotions. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm">Be as sly as serpents and innocent as doves.</a> When someone brings up “issues” turn the tables against them. One way is to ask for specifics, the more details the better. People will try to give general examples that lack substance. One of the best things you can do is get a progressive snowflake to question progressive ideologies.</p>
<p>An example would be the “scientific” research quoted by many people about sexual assault. What they don’t tell people, and people do not think to ask, is how sexual assault is defined. Sexual assault is typically defined as any unwanted touching. This can mean a woman visits a concert and has people who brush against her or accidentally touch her, which would be common at a crowded place. This would be classified by feminists and progressives as sexual assault.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-128859 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/807.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="347"></p>
<p>Be aware of the activities and learn the tactics and strategies of your enemies, but do not spend a lot focused on the enemy directly. Tactics and strategies of war are good to learn, but we must take care not to become the <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/you-become-what-you-fight">same as our enemy</a>. God uses the wicked to punish and destroy the wicked. In the words of C.S. Lewis.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two equal and opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by both errors and hail a materialist or a magician with the same delight.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1964, James Clavell, wrote <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheChildrensStory-ButNotJustForChildren_224">The Children’s Story… But Not Just for Children</a>. The story was made into a <a href="https://archive.org/details/TheChildrensStory">short film in 1982</a>. Watch the clever tactics used on children and compare them to modern progressives. Watch the methodology used to get the children to cut up the U.S. flag, destroy a belief in prayer and God, and even go against their parents.</p>

<p>Progressive can fight over a dead horse all they want; and whomever wants to fight with them about the dead horse is certainly welcome to engage them. How do you fix over 80 years of progressive ideological disease? Protect and rebuild the foundational framework.</p>
