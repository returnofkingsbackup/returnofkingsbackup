<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>As I’ve watched the US and European nations destroy themselves through idiotic policies, I’ve often wondered how we got into this predicament. After much thought, I am convinced that most of our ills are attributable the drive to be “nice.” Here are some examples of how niceness is destroying us.</p>
<h3>Being nice poisons our relations with women</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-128921 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/overcoming-nice-guy-syndrome.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="250" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/overcoming-nice-guy-syndrome.jpg 450w, wp-content/uploads/2017/08/overcoming-nice-guy-syndrome-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></p>
<p>Being a nice guy is the kiss of death if you want to get and keep a woman. This may sound odd because every woman, when asked, says that she wants a nice guy. In truth, women despise nice guys. What they really want is a strong man—a man who will lead them. But it is impossible to lead while always being nice.</p>
<p>Niceness is what leads men to beta orbit women on social media and in real life. The manosphere has been out here for years but I still see men posting comments like, “You look really beautiful,” to mediocre-looking women on Instagram. What do these men gain from commenting on an attention-whoring photo? What do you think the chances are that the woman who posts these pics will choose to date one of the 50 thirsty men who commented on her photo?</p>
<p>Being nice is even more of a liability in marriage and long-term relationships. It may be nice to ignore your mission to please your spouse, but it will repel her over the long haul. This is because niceness is inherently beta and women do not want beta males. I know two cases of men who had their wives cheat on them. In each case, there was nothing that the man did wrong. Neither man cheated on his wife, gambled away the family fortune, or developed a heroin addiction. They were both outstanding providers and fathers.</p>
<p>Their only fault was they were <em>too nice</em>. Their marriages could’ve have been saved if they had been more willing to unapologetically take the lead in the relationship.</p>
<h3>Niceness in religion</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-128923" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/webRNS-JAMES-MARTIN2-040617-690x450-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="326" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/webRNS-JAMES-MARTIN2-040617-690x450-300x196.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/08/webRNS-JAMES-MARTIN2-040617-690x450-100x65.jpg 100w, wp-content/uploads/2017/08/webRNS-JAMES-MARTIN2-040617-690x450-260x170.jpg 260w, wp-content/uploads/2017/08/webRNS-JAMES-MARTIN2-040617-690x450.jpg 690w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Christian teaching has been deeply affected by the “will to niceness.” I recently read a discussion on Twitter between three theology students, one male and two females, at the Dallas Theological Seminary. DTS was once a conservative Evangelical seminary. Now it seems it has succumbed to therapy culture. The discussion consisted of the man challenging feminist talking points, but then conceding the argument to the women because he was told that he ultimately “could never understand being a woman.”</p>
<p>Sacrificing truth at the altar of niceness is not just something done by Protestants. In the past 50 years the Catholic Church has also de-emphasized its more difficult moral doctrines in the hope that it would become more welcoming. It has gotten so bad that some are teaching that having nice manners <a href="https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2017/08/fr-manners">necessitates that the Church drop certain moral teachings altogether</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, niceness in religion has the exact opposite of its intended effect. Rather than removing impediments to faith, it waters down that faith to the point where it is so insipid that there is no reason to even bother.</p>

<h3>Being nice is destroying the West</h3>

<p>Pretty much everything that ails Western countries is the result of someone’s stupid attempt to be nice to one group or another. Girl power was built on the premise that girls might feel bad about themselves and that is why they chose not to go into disciplines that are dominated by men. Gay marriage is the law of the land because we bought into idea that the homosexual men were sad that they could not enter into lifetime monogamous commitments.</p>
<p>When a few Social Justice Warriors complain about Confederate statues (<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lots-of-americans-arent-sure-if-we-should-take-down-confederate-statues/">most blacks don’t seem to care</a>), <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/450470/charlottesville-virignia-robert-e-lee-statue-remove-right-decision-confederate-monuments-museums">conservatives quickly agree to take them down</a> because they value being popular more than sticking to their principles. Europe and the US’s immigration policy is similarly driven by niceness. These nations are willing to sacrifice the lives of their citizens rather that make people who live in Islamic countries feel bad.</p>
<p>In reality, it is not possible to govern a country without offending someone. Trying to do so can only lead to foolish decisions.</p>
<h3>Being good is not the same as being nice</h3>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don’t be afraid to embrace your inner asshole.</p>
<p>You can’t go through life being nice to everyone. Sometimes you gotta say fuck it.</p>

One of the most common misconceptions of being nice is that it is the same as being good. This misconception even affects many otherwise red-pilled men. The truth is that being nice is often the exact opposite of being good.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the compulsion to be nice springs from an inordinate desire to be popular and loved. The conservatives at National Review capitulate on every major cultural issue because they want to remain members of progressive society. Christian leaders who water down doctrine do it because they have a greater desire for the acclaim of the crowd than they do the salvation of souls. And beta orbiters on social media prefer to get a “like” from an internet thot to improving themselves.</p>
<p>By contrast, being good means you will sometimes have to assume unpopular positions. This is especially true on modern society where good and evil have been completed inverted. If you share the same political opinions your grandfather held, you will be branded as a fire breathing racist. You may lose your job because of it. If you want to restore the patriarchy, you will be shunned as a troglodyte.</p>
<p>Although there is a cost to being good, it is important to remember that history is never made by “nice” men, but by those who dare to hold lofty ideals even when it goes against popular opinion.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We must wage a holy war against “being nice.” But this holy war is not targeted at any external enemy but at the “nice guy” who lives inside each of us. You must oppose him every time he wants to beta orbit a girl online or in real life. Slay him when he urges you to put your woman before your mission. Crush him if he suggests that you should tone down your political or moral views to avoid offending others. At all times choose to do what is right and good, not what is nice.</p>
<p>This is a battle that lasts a lifetime. We were all programmed to be nice guys. Getting over that programming is not easy, but the rewards are worth it: you’ll will experience true freedom when you end the tyranny of nice.</p>
