<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Hurricane Irma captured the world’s attention in the beginning of September. By the end of September’s first week, Irma reached its peak intensity with 185 mph (295 km/h) winds, and a minimum pressure of 914 hPa (27.0 inHg). I checked the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Irma#Records">Wikipedia page</a> and it seems that it is considered the seventh most intense landfall hurricane in the US.</p>
<p>As we know, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/34134/fact-checking-emotional-propaganda">“never let a good crisis go to waste”</a>. This was the sign for all “Climate enthusiasts” and “Global Warming” people to push their agenda. The mainstream media is there to help. For example, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21727898-if-global-warming-were-not-enough-threat-poor-planning-and-unwise-subsidies-make-floods">this article</a> in The Economist said:</p>
<blockquote><p>One cause is <strong>global warming</strong>. The frequency and severity of hurricanes <strong>vary naturally</strong>—America has seen unusually few in the past decade. Yet the underlying global trend is what you would expect from climate change.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-64018" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/highly-illogical.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="418"></p>
<p>So at the same time you blame global warming, even though there is literally no evidence, you have the usual double speak of “It’s because of global warming” while at the same time “There is no actual proof”. Oh, and we forgot the scapegoat, or the devil himself, Trump. The Guardian <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/10/hurricane-irma-harvey-climate-change-trump">blamed</a> Trump. No, he did not cause the storms, but it is because of him that there will be more death:</p>
<blockquote><p>But the merciless assault on the US mainland by Harvey and Irma should be forcing the president to recognise the consequences of his arrogance and complacency in dismissing the research and analysis carried out by scientists.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article keeps on going. It states that climate change is not responsible for a specific storm or number of storms, but then it flips back to saying that there are three reasons for climate change to make hurricanes worse: warmer water makes harsher storms, hotter atmosphere makes heavier rain, and higher sea levels make storms more deadly as they have more water to push. So we should understand that global warming is bad, and do everything in our power to reduce CO2 emissions, whatever the cost may be.</p>
<h3>Have you heard about the “Hurricane Drought”?</h3>
<p>CNS news had an <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/susan-jones/major-us-hurricane-drought-ends-after-record-4323-days">interesting article</a>. Its title was “U.S. Major Hurricane Drought Ends at Record 4,323 Days”. It seems that for twelve years no major hurricane (Category 3 and above) has hit the US. There were nine minor ones (Class 2 and below) and one 2012 superstorm (Sandy), which was not considered a hurricane (post-tropical cyclone). The last “Drought” was 1860-1869.</p>
<div style="width: 528px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img src="../www.thegwpf.com/content/uploads/2017/08/Pielke-Article-2017.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="384"><p class="wp-caption-text">“The world is presently in an era of unusually low weather disasters. This holds for the weather phenomena that have historically caused the most damage: tropical cyclones, floods, tornadoes and drought.”                             Roger Pielke Jr 2017</p>
</div>
<p>I’m a little confused. How can it be that we see less hurricanes, which cause less harm, and at the same time have global warming and more storms? Well, the <a href="http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/">NOAA clearly states</a> (or less clearly in this case):</p>
<blockquote><p>It is <strong>premature to conclude that human activities</strong>–and particularly greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming–have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. That said, human activities may have already caused changes that are not yet detectable due to the small magnitude of the changes or observational limitations.</p></blockquote>
<p>After 200 years of carbon emissions, which grow more in magnitude, there is no concrete evidence that it actually impacts tropical storms in terms of their creation, magnitude or frequency. We keep hearing that global warming will make it worse, but it does not seem like it.</p>
<p>How about those three reasons mentioned before? Well, here is a funny thing: there is no correlation reported or observed. First, there is no evidence of storms becoming worse. Second, some researchers claim that CO2 emissions and pollution actually <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/11/11/142218650/air-pollution-bad-for-health-but-good-for-planet">balance global warming</a>. Third, sea level rise was just 1-3 mm annually. Claiming that this has a major effect on storms is a new level of absurd, unless you’re SJW. In this case, anything goes.</p>

<h3>More progress, less casualties</h3>
<p>If global warming harms more people, we should actually consider changing the policy, but here is the “craziest” thing: there are less casualties.</p>
<p>In 1900, the “<strong>Great Galveston Hurricane”</strong>, which was “only” a category 4 storm, killed 6000-12000 people. That was the deadliest hurricane recorded. Hurricane Katrina (2005) was the fourth deadliest, killing 1500 persons. You might claim that the difference may not be that big, until one recalls that in 1900 there were about 3 million people in Texas, while Louisiana in 2005 was the home of 4.5 million. So we have less people dying from hurricane over the year – both absolute and relative numbers.</p>

</div>
<p>Those dreaded fossil fuels are the same ones that <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/09/06/hurricane-irma-may-bring-significant-storm-surge-to-florida-governor-says.html">evacuated</a> millions of people. Shelters, medicine, and the ability to provide care for the people all rely on fuel. Yep, those same carbon emitting substances that should be reduced.</p>
<p>It seems that deadliest disasters, recorded since 1900, were almost all in under-developed nations. Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_by_death_toll#Ten_deadliest_natural_disasters_since_1900">Wikipedia</a> on that. Oh, and only one of them was after the year 2000 (the famous Tsunami of 2004). Europe has last witnessed a natural catastrophe of death toll over 100,000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_natural_disasters_by_death_toll#Ten_deadliest_floods_.2F_landslides">people in the <em>16<sup>th</sup> century</em></a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands">Netherlands</a> – flood).  Check out that page, and you will see that there is now rarely a big natural catastrophe of historical scale. Progress, that which have brought us the carbon emissions, has been the major factor in human casualties’ reduction.</p>
<h3>Global Warming activists – this is your wakeup call</h3>
<p>This article paints a clear picture: progress has a positive effect on catastrophe casualties’ reduction, while it has an unclear effect on the climate. When it comes to hurricanes it is actually clear that there is no effect. If one wishes to reduce carbon emissions, there is a price, and that price may include human lives.</p>
<p>This web site has dealt before with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/76745/the-end-goal-of-western-progressivism-is-depopulation">population reduction</a>. In this case I want to use Hanlon razor – “Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity”. I myself, don’t believe that there is an actual intent to have more people die in natural catastrophe, but that is my opinion.</p>

<p>Hurricane Irma is not a wakeup call for president Trump. It is a wakeup call for climatologists and “global warming” activists. Show some humility and admit that the situation is a complex one. Stop trying to engineer the climate. Stop messing with the economy; you are only playing into the hands of the elite. Look at the data, sea levels <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/5067351/Rise-of-sea-levels-is-the-greatest-lie-ever-told.html">may not even be rising</a>. I’m not saying that pollution is good, but I am saying that a binary state of mind (we are good, anyone else is evil) is wrong.</p>
