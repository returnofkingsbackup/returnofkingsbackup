<p>America is a society that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0393307387">drenched in narcissism</a>. As such, American sexuality is very much influenced by this self-absorption. However, it is also a society that caters to women – it is society that is centered around female interests &amp; desires. What often gets confused as male privilege is the fact that women are supremely interested in alpha males. Feminists would characterize this interest of women in alphas as male privilege, but what really is going on is that women are sexually attracted to alphas, so, clearly, those males will get great levels of exposure in society and media.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images-17.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13853" alt="images (17)" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/07/images-17.jpg"></a></p>
<p>You see this in feminist circles with bitter fights over beauty standards, careers and relationships between men and women. Lesbian feminists could care less about heterosexual women getting the men they desire – they don’t want to be judged for being ugly and unfeminine. They try to pretend they care about gendered oppression of beauty standards, but they really just want to change those standards for their own homosexual benefit. The fight between these camps is narcissistic and grounded in their own sexuality. Lesbians get the benefit of ignoring male sexuality; heterosexual women cannot ignore male sexuality if they wish to have an actual sex life outside the confines of their own imagination.</p>
<p>The sexual hierarchy in America is this:</p>
<p><strong>Alphas</strong> &gt; <strong>Women</strong> &gt; <strong>Betas</strong> &gt; <strong>Omegas</strong></p>
<p>For the purposes of this expose,  alphas refer to men women find sexually attractive, betas are men women consider settling material and omegas are men that never get laid.</p>
<p>Alphas don’t have to be narcissists, but they do have some of those qualities because of being so privileged by female sexual adoration. When a person is subject to so much positive attention, it stands to reason narcissism can develop. Often times, though, narcissism doesn’t develop. What often develops is an abundance mentality that results in a more indifferent approach to women. The narcissism of women, however, radically alters the sexual hierarchy.</p>
<p>Women seek equality with alphas by trying to become alphas themselves. They want to have their money turn men on, they want their snark and independence make alphas salivate to for them. They want to work beside them in high status professions – think Boston Legal and Grey’s Anatomy. They want crowds of fans rocking out to their live music. They want adoring alphas wearing their sports jerseys and come to their games and cheer when hit the trey.</p>
<p>A problem of the first order is the  approval they get from beta/omega males and females. Women appreciate female approval on a superficial level, but they know it is often fake and is so ubiquitous that it is boring and expected. As for betas, let’s set them aside as they are post-carousel material. Omegas are repulsive not just sexually but are a reflection of dark days for women. Most modern women has thrown herself at some retreating alpha, offering up her body as a salve to a failing relationship. Deep down, they know they spend way too many resources – emotional, financial &amp; temporal – trying to keep said man around.</p>
<p>This is applicable to omegas because the rank desperation reminds them how unattainable alphas often are for them – omegas sometimes are a reflection of a woman’s position vis-a-vis alphas. Further, they remind women of the lengths they would go for alpha approval by the lengths omegas will go to secure female approval.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4_hot_club_girls1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13143" alt="4_hot_club_girls" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/06/4_hot_club_girls1.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The other problem is the fact that alphas are not sexually turned on by provisioning ability, confidence or social status. Women are often bitter and disappointed because alphas don’t care about that. Women have been falsely told that everything they have gained since second-wave feminism have made them more attractive to men. It hasn’t. The realization often makes women justifiably bitter.  Women haven’t become alphas, they have become the betas they settle for.</p>

</div>
<p>The other issue is that if women get what they claim to want and get this approval from alphas, they often lose attraction to the alpha. Imagine some alpha husband wearing WNBA player’s jersey to her games regularly– where do you think the arc of that relationship is headed? Sure, it is possible he has that much hand, but it isn’t probable.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about sexual marketplace value as it relates age and weight. The pool of alphas is fairly steady. The marriageable ones and the one’s that will marry will dwindle quickly. Women at 35 are likely to find a 50 year old divorced alpha with no desire to father more children. Which brings in age; women are often forced to consider beta males as mates as they age. Which brings in betas.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/06/201002-omag-book-gottlieb-220x312.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13146" alt="201002-omag-book-gottlieb-220x312" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/06/201002-omag-book-gottlieb-220x312.jpg"></a></p>
<p>When confronted with the reality that they have the mentality of a beta male or an omega coupled with their increasing inability to have sex with lesser alphas, a woman has a serious identity crisis. You get later in life lesbians, single mothers, women flying to Haiti for sexual adventurism. Think a “Stella Got Her Groove” back situation. The carousel riding ends here. What begins is long process of female self-delusion that very much tracks a female compensatory narcissist/male codependent relationship.</p>
<p>Women need serious levels of social support and self delusion to make a beta palatable. Some women are direct about their lack of love for their man, however that is usually after the valuation period. Facebook, Instagram and other forms of social media seriously aid women as she can publicly claim her beta is different and is a real man because he cuddles with her and confesses his deepest fears to the her. What he doesn’t know is he is setting up a codependent/compensatory narcissist relationship with the woman. As such, the storm clouds gather.</p>
<p>The woman will sleep with the beta, romance him and make him feel loved. She acting out the beginning of relationships with alphas. The marriage engagement is a huge candy bar for her hamster to gnaw on while the her blood is starting to boil. It starts to come out during the engagement with anger about the wedding plans, with the beta comforting her and reassuring her that he loves her. She knows that that’s why she is marrying you – she can control you knowing you need her more than she needs you – she knows you will always be there to assuage her ego. The wedding will be a calm before the storm once the honeymoon ends. The beta will think the wedding stress was the cause of the relationship issues.</p>
<p>The marriage will go downhill quickly. Sex will dry up and she will become increasingly critical. She will demand declarations of love and worship. She will begin to only treat him well in public and being to treat him poorly in private. She will often use sex as a weapon and sometimes physically abuse him. Unable to comprehend the problem is his lack of alpha, he will blame himself, beating himself up for not being supportive enough, not listening to her, etc. The gap between her own perception of her attractiveness to alphas and her attractiveness to alphas in reality will fuel how badly she will treat her beta.</p>
<p>Look at that the website <a href="http://www.askmen.com/">Askmen.com</a> – it is one massive beta indoctrination program. Women need to know men are reading that, in the vain hope alphas will become more beta and betas stay beta so they have a class of men to settle for.</p>
<p>This utilitarian approach women take to men have biological roots, but understand it is exacerbated by American psychology. Alphas have serious privilege and women resent it. The sexual revolution for them has been a large negative. A huge plus in college and right after, but women quickly realize it is bad that society does not force alphas and greater betas into marriage. Notice the constant preening rhetoric of how important the social gains are for women.</p>
<p><em>Yay careers! Yay not having to get married! My fancy degree means more than a man! Men are scared of my accomplishments! Ugh, I am so AWESOME! </em></p>
<p><em>So, uh, where are the hot boys?</em></p>
<p>This is little more than the self-absorbed preening in order  to convince themselves that this whole scheme has been a net positive for them. It hasn’t. As usual, alphas benefit supremely.</p>
