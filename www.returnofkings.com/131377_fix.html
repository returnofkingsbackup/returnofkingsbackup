<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Along with blue pill and global governance comes the <a href="https://archive.is/F9hXd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollow Empire</a>. We live in the golden age of marketing, public relationships, and propaganda. Many people are good at crafting appearances and virtue-signaling by the standards of the degenerate mainstream. The cities are littered with awesome, hip images, but this world is full of it.</p>
<p>Cities are full of useless bureaucrats, con artists, effeminate men, and man-jawed women. People are fake. Interests and excessive desires are either veiled under passive-aggressive forms or openly communicated through sheer assholery. No mystery why <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/64452/the-principal-tenets-of-stoicism-by-seneca">stoicism</a> came back into fashion among conscious men: when your day is full of fake smiles, you’re better off working on your inner fortress. (And when you’re stoic <em>and</em> poor, <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/clean-bulking-diet-plan-cheap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bulking on a budget</a> makes you better off as well.)</p>
<p>In such a world, some human qualities are sorely lacking. They are often perceived as signs of weakness, naivete, or as antics. Or some start counterfeiting and misdirecting them.</p>
<h3>1. Loyalty</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141322" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Sheep dogs are amongst the most loyal breeds out there. Have you seen a lot of them in metropolises? Bourgeois bohemians prefer small, frail dwarf dogs that cost a small fortune. Or <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/35965/why-women-are-like-cats-and-men-are-like-dogs">cats</a>, whose displays of egoism and moodiness are always overlooked because they’re sooo cute.</p>
<p>Loyalty is a noble trait. It supposes courage, constancy, straightforwardness. A loyal parent cares. A loyal citizen does his duty and tends to become a pillar of his community. A loyal friend is someone you know you can count on. Unfortunately, loyalty has been both abused and derided. Since the 60s, the media started associating it with purportedly “oppressive” and narrow-minded people while encouraging sheepish behavior towards the latest craze.</p>
<p>Being loyal to a girl who would only remain if you treat her badly would be foolish. Beyond this, it is hard to be a loyal patriot once you know how much nation-states sent Europeans kill each other for nothing but neoconnish interests. As French writer Louis-Ferdinand Céline said, “you think you’ll die for your country but what you’ll really lose your life for is bank vaults.”</p>
<h3>2. Kindness</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141324" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/3-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>According to the dictionaries, being kind means having a benevolent, friendly, helpful disposition. In a normal society, kindness would be the sign of a good nature and it would be rewarded. In The Current Year, kindness towards women or strangers will have you exploited then called a loser or hypocrite. Men with low self-esteem started to serve women in exchange for absolutely nothing: this warped beta niceness has become a patron for kindness in general.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘I’ve tried speed dating and all the dating Apps, but every time I put my real age, all I get are idiots and losers,’ she told the New York Post. ‘I figured, why not make them useful and have them help me around the house?’</p>
<p>She found a match with a man wearing overalls and wielding a hammer in his profile photo and invited him over to install her air conditioning… After he successfully carried out the installation, Bloom asked him to leave and didn’t answer his messages asking her to go on a proper date. (<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3683646/Finding-man-chores-Growing-numbers-women-using-Tinder-chaps-household-tasks-DIY.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Mail</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Displaying kindness towards freewheeling <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/female-hypergamy-advantage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">female hypergamy</a> is the same than being loyal to a brand that makes millions out of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-fans-merriam-webster-sheeple-definition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sheeple</a>. A sane mind doesn’t do it.</p>
<h3>3. Politeness and courtesy</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/dh7yaNvSjRI.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Both words refer to a kind of high culture: refined interests, a genuine concern for arts and <em>belles lettres</em>, a tactful and gallant temperament. Polite, courteous manners thrived during the eighteenth and nineteenth century. They were derided as bourgeois by Bolshevists and promiscuous bohemians. Today, loud-mouthed girls know nothing of it, and both have been turned into either mild-mannered spinelessness or pure snobbery.</p>
<p>The arts associated with politeness, such as theatre or classical music, were appropriated by old money whereas the masses are fed with pop garbage. Actually, you can be polite and courteous if you hop in the right context, then use it as a folding screen for game, Sandor Szavost-style. Otherwise you will come across as formal or distant or snobbish. Indeed, neither do boyish immaturity nor grrly aggressive narcissism provide good grounds for taking a woman’s hand and leading her through an impeccable tango.</p>
<h3>4. Forgiveness</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-141327" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/4-1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/4-1.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/4-1-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/4-1-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Jesus Christ extolled forgiveness beyond revenge. Clear the slate, turn the other cheek. Just like toleration, forgiveness works best when it is reciprocated: I’ll forgive your misdeeds because you will forgive mine, I’ll tolerate your antics because you will accept my eccentricities. When the reciprocal aspect wanes, these qualities turn into sheer weakness. Forgiving a BLM activist who sent your brother into a coma only means giving him a pass so he’ll do the same to you.</p>
<p>The Golden Rule, just as any of its derivatives, only works within a context of reciprocation and mutual trust. German jurist <a href="http://guerrillaontologies.com/2014/09/hostis-vs-inimicus-an-etymological-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carl Schmitt</a> noticed the Latin Bible told about forgiving the <em>inimicus</em>, the disagreeable guy you’re squabbling with, not the <em>hostis</em> or foreign enemy who will take your head as soon as he can. There is no point being forgiving towards an enemy you have nothing in common.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the chaotic Current Year destroyed most boundaries. It is sometimes hard to say who’s an <em>inimicus</em> or occasional yet brotherly rival you can forgive, and who’s a <em>hostis</em> you should always be vigilant of.</p>
<h3>5. Patience</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-141328 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/6.jpg" alt="Arno Brecker did nothing wrong" width="600" height="400" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/6.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/6-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/6-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>As the saying goes, the early bird catches the worm. Being patient, planning, delaying gratification, is part of achieving great things. (Unless you’re picking up a Western whore whom you should bed early). The occult elite does not want you to be like that. Rather, those on the top want you to look for instant gratification.</p>
<p>The social media crack pipe, junk food, porn, and video games are designed so you get a massive rush of dopamine early on and get back there for more. If you go down this road you’ll become impatient, addicted, unable to work long hours without some unnatural gratification.</p>
<p>Of course this mindset makes you dependent, frail, unable to provide for yourself over the long term. Impatience is often associated with neuroticism, immaturity, and seeking external validation.</p>
<p>Being patient—without being passive—is required to tread the long path towards the top of the mountain.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Patience can be exercised alone on a purely Stoic fashion. Being patient only requires mastery of oneself, not of others. The four other qualities are essentially social but hard to exert in an anomous, low-trust society. Our natural propensities, from loyalty to the desire to provide, were misdirected and exploited. This made us wary of society in general and of other individuals in particular. When people are foreign to each other they are bound to screw and get screwed.</p>
<p>The better angels of our nature, yet, are still there. In spite of constant bickering and backstabbing the dissenters are closer to each other than to degenerate normies. Some girls can become reliable housewives. Hipsters who snark at old-fashioned qualities are the kind of people who build nothing. If we manage to build thick relationships again, we will effectively foster a civilization renewal.</p>
