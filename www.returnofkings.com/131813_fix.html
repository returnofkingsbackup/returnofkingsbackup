<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>A lot of men I talk to think the best way to find a good girl is to visit a small town or village. The girls will be more pristine, they figure, and they’re generally right about that, but there’s just one big problem: those girls have not been tempted enough for us to know what their true character is.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of “good” in a girl. The first is situational, where she appears good only because the devil has yet to tempt her. The second is tested, where he made his offering but she resisted. When a man identifies a girl who has upstanding character or morals, what he actually found is a girl who has yet to be tossed into a world of sex, drugs, money, or attention (fame). Once that temptation occurs, or she is removed from a bubble that has kept her good, it’s nearly certain that she will dive head-first into the ocean of <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/women-have-reduced-themselves-to-sexual-commodities">human depravity</a>.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, I noticed that a girl is most kind and sweet in the six-month period starting with her freshman college year after moving from the village to the city. She’s also the easiest to get into bed. Her sexuality and raging hormones have been bottled up in the village, watched carefully by her family, but now that she’s in the city, she can finally do what she wanted to do all along. It wasn’t that she was a good girl in her village, but that she lacked the opportunity. As much as I would like to think I’m a casanova for sleeping with such a girl, the reality is that I was her gateway into a promiscuous lifestyle, soon to be forgotten after her 20th or so sexual encounter.</p>
<p>If I go to a village today, and meet a 22-year-old girl who didn’t have the chance to attend college and who has a notch count of less than five, is that confirmation of her goodness? It’s not, because she has yet to be put in a sinful environment. I think we already know what she would do if she had the opportunity to move to a cosmopolitan city like New York, London, or Toronto.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-131815 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nyc-girl.jpg" alt="" width="371" height="409"></p>
<p>The saying “all women are like that” implies that if you tempt a woman with a city lifestyle where she can have anonymous casual sex with men who turn her on, <em>she will do it</em>. Some may just experiment, a notch here or there, but a girl won’t say no unless she happens to be part of a tight-knit community that constantly watches her. The number of women who are capable of resisting are in fact so few that they are statistically insignificant. We should therefore assume that <em>no woman</em> can pass the test of temptation, and perhaps no man as well.</p>
<p>Every single female you meet has succumbed or will succumb to temptation, and it may be unfair to expect anything otherwise. This is why, as women have <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/women-are-abusive-when-not-socially-constrained">degraded sharply</a> in the past century, the only way to keep men interested in marriage is through sustained cultural programming that makes them accept obesity (as beauty), vulgarity (as strength), promiscuity (as experience), bisexuality (as sexy), and equality (as just). Constant offerings of temptation are causing female value to plummet to such an extent that men have to <span style="font-size: 14.4px;">be</span><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"> </span><span style="font-size: 14.4px;"><em>literally brainwashed</em> to believe that women are still beautiful princesses who must be cherished and beholden to.</span></p>

</div>
<p>Upon realizing that no woman can truly resist temptation when tested, we encounter a simple solution: don’t test them with temptation. Create a better society with built-in safe spaces where the sweet and kind teenage girl stays locked into situational goodness thanks to male efforts shielding her from the temptation she has no innate immunity against. If Eve could not resist from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, today’s modern woman cannot resist even the smallest bread crumb.</p>
<p>The challenge for men wanting to create a family is therefore not trying to find a good girl who can resist temptation but one who, through good parenting or sheer luck, has not yet been excessively tempted, and keep her there by building a firewall which prevents the devil from knocking on her door when you momentarily step away. The only way I can see this reasonably happening today is to find a girl who has economically poor parents that are religious <em>and</em> where she eagerly accepted their religious teachings. You will maintain her faith and give her a slightly upgraded standard of living that is valuable to her and her parents but not so valuable that you tempt her with status and riches. Go to the village to find the good girl, but you’ll have to keep her there, or you’ll find out for sure that she has no innate goodness like you may have thought.</p>

<p>Understand that the problem of goodness is not exclusive to women. When I had the opportunity to experience carnal and worldly pleasures, I took it… for over a decade. The fact that I realized it was a dead-end does not make me a moral man, and the only credit I can accept is eventually understanding <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-novelty-wheel">what hedonism really stands for</a>. I’m not impressed by men who preach to me their moral goodness because it’s almost certain they haven’t been tempted around the world by beautiful women, but if they have indeed rejected Brazilian, Colombian, Ukrainian, Polish, and Croatian women who wanted to sleep with them, something that I found impossible to do, I will personally commission golden crowns of morality for them to wear.</p>
<p>There’s no need to despair upon realizing <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-true-nature-of-women">the flawed nature of women</a>, because it’s really the flaw of humans. When presented with options of excitement, sex, and sin, we almost always take the low road. Instead of asking women to possess moral strength that they simply don’t have, we should simply identify women who haven’t yet been tempted or who have made tiny mistakes when tempted strongly. If a woman moved to a big city, refrained from drinking, and maintained a religious social circle, it may be prudent to accept her if she made one or two mistakes.</p>
<p>There aren’t many girls out there like that, but if you find and marry her, do your part in helping create a home, a neighborhood, a society where temptation is moved to the background of life like it was in the past, instead of being thrown directly in our faces like it is today.</p>
