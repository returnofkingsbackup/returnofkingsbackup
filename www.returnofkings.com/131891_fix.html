Despite their wealth and fame, movie stars are essentially disposable, given the vast number of hopefuls who would sell their souls for a shot at stardom. However, Hollywood’s problems don’t end with them.</p>
<h3>Harvey Weinstein</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/fWA5ffftBAs.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Quite unusually, the spotlight has focused further up the food chain on <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/131513/liberal-hollywood-had-decades-to-expose-harvey-weinsteins-sexual-predation-but-did-nothing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvey Weinstein</a>, a 65 year old producer involved in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005544/?ref_=nv_sr_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 300 movies and TV shows</a> since 1981. Some of his more famous films were <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/108355/why-quentin-tarantino-is-one-of-hollywoods-biggest-cucks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the <em>Kill Bill</em> series, <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, <em>Inglorious </em></a><span style="color: #0000ee;"><i><u>Basterds</u></i></span>, and <em><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/122037/nelson-mandela-has-left-a-legacy-of-utter-failure-in-south-africa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mandela</a>: Long Walk to Freedom</em>. If recent allegations are true, could this be symptomatic of a larger problem?</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>New York Times</em> article</a> begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two decades ago, the Hollywood producer <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/us/statement-from-harvey-weinstein.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvey Weinstein</a> invited Ashley Judd to the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel for what the young actress expected to be a business breakfast meeting. Instead, he had her sent up to his room, where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower, she recalled in an interview.</p>
<p>“How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?” Ms. Judd said she remembers thinking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn’t just a single “he said / she said” incident; it describes several other very similar encounters. Another item mentions an alleged groping of an Italian model. The article stated that frequently these resulted in cash settlements, often with a confidentiality agreement. Journalists have failed to report on these incidents. It’s no accident that the Big Six MSM megaconglomerates own Hollywood’s Big Ten movie studios. Despite <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/101487/hollywood-has-forgiven-mel-gibson-but-at-what-cost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some exceptions</a>, the great moguls seldom get thrown under the bus.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-131572" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NMhWe0p.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NMhWe0p.jpg 675w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NMhWe0p-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/NMhWe0p-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Despite anything that may or may not have happened, Weinstein does have serious feminist street cred. The <em>NYT</em> article states that his company distributed a feature concerning the subject of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/88551/its-becoming-too-dangerous-for-college-males-to-date-girls-on-campus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campus sexual assault</a>. He raised money for <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/99001/7-wikileaks-revelations-about-hillary-clinton-that-the-media-is-completely-ignoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hillary’s campaign</a>, gave Malia Obama an internship, “recently helped endow a faculty chair at Rutgers University in Gloria Steinem’s name”, and participated in a women’s march during the Sundance Film Festival.</p>
<p>His attorney states <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/harvey-weinstein-lawsuit-new-york-times-is-being-prepared-says-his-attorney-1046170" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these allegations are false</a>, and legal action may result against the <em>Times</em>. According to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/us/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up <em>NYT</em> article</a>, a third of his company’s board quit. Further, Weinstein made an apology, recognizing that all this “caused a lot of pain”, and will be taking some time off indefinitely.</p>
<p>Still, perhaps the public hasn’t seen the last of these disputes, as several <a href="http://pagesix.com/tag/harvey-weinstein/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new stories</a> recently surfaced elsewhere. Some allegations are <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvey-weinstein-accused-of-raping-women-new-yorker/?ftag=MSF0951a18" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considerably worse</a>. Even <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/93777/hillary-and-bill-clinton-are-criminal-masterminds-wielding-incredible-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hillary</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/112995/the-shame-of-president-obamas-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lightworker</a> had to <a href="http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/obama-speaks-out-on-harvey-weinstein-allegations/ar-AAth59i?li=BBmkt5R&amp;ocid=ientp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take notice</a>.</p>
<p>Even if most turns out to be true, it would merely be the tip of Tinseltown’s very dirty iceberg.</p>
<h3>Hollywood’s sordid history</h3>

<p>Sexual harassment is particularly <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/94402/what-to-do-if-youre-accused-of-sexual-harassment-at-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thorny subject</a>. On the one hand, being a sleazebag is obviously reprehensible. <em>Nobody should be asked to trade sexual favors for employment.</em> On the other hand, legal developments have created a climate of fear, and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/11619/the-anatomy-of-a-false-sexual-harassment-accusation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfounded charges</a> can be very damaging. Further, the rich and famous should be <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/96005/the-elites-have-one-rule-for-themselves-and-one-rule-for-the-rest-of-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answerable to the same rules</a> applying to everyone else.</p>
<p>The motion picture industry long has been a staple of American culture. Thomas Edison and D.W. Griffith created its early beginnings. Soon after, Hollywood was established by Central and Eastern European immigrants. All of the chiefs ended up ditching their starter wives for nubile movie stars. Despite that, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_couch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">casting couch</a>” gambit has been legendary for a century.</p>
<p>Simply put, where there’s smoke, there’s fire. Although remarried to America’s most beautiful women, <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/202526/Hollywood-s-dirty-little-secret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trading sexual favors</a> for starring roles was something expected of many other actresses to open doors. Marilyn Monroe’s 1955 statement (after she got a major contract) is rather telling:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll never have to suck another [nationality adjective] cock again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Julia Phillips even wrote a bestseller about the industry’s moral turpitude during the 1970s-1980s called <em>You’ll Never Eat Lunch In This Town Again</em>. How deep does the dirt go?</p>
<p>The sleaze continues and is international in scope, noted in the European cinematic scene, and even the outwardly puritanical institution of Bollywood. It’s so bad that the film industry is the one place where feminists would actually have a point about “institutionalized this” and “structural that”. However, like with most <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/57090/the-newfound-alliance-between-feminism-marxism-and-radical-islam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real ongoing problems</a>, feminists usually take relatively little notice.</p>
<h3>It gets worse yet</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/IoRkFTYtbuU.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Typical “casting couch” incidents involved young adult women, and were <em>quid pro quo</em> offers which they could accept or decline. Once again, let it be clear that being a sleazebag is wrong. Unfortunately, it doesn’t end there.</p>
<p>Teenagers—and even younger—of both sexes have been subjected to inappropriate conduct. Shirley Temple wrote about a producer exposing himself when she was <em>twelve.</em> As disgusting as that is, outright coercion has happened too amidst a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/86217/does-the-hollywood-elite-use-rituals-and-sexual-blackmail-to-keep-its-stars-in-line" target="_blank" rel="noopener">culture of secrecy</a>. Sometimes that includes minors being <a href="http://nypost.com/2013/10/19/the-childhood-hell-of-the-lost-boys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plied with drugs</a>. Hollywood’s response to the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/57465/why-do-hollywood-sjws-still-defend-this-pedophile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roman Polanski matter</a> is basically, “That happened a long time ago; besides, <em>he’s cool!</em>”</p>
<p>Conventional law enforcement typically has had notorious difficulty handling high-profile cases. Then what can be done about <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/12/05/recent-charges-sexual-abuse-children-in-hollywood-just-tip-iceberg-experts-say.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these problems</a>?</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>

</div>
<p>So Hollywood has tolerated grotesquely immoral behavior since day one. Other than that, they’ve been using their position to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75991/why-star-wars-the-force-awakens-is-a-social-justice-propaganda-film" target="_blank" rel="noopener">push cultural Marxism</a>. Lately, their propaganda is so bad that it affects the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/91699/feminist-ghostbusters-bombs-despite-hysterical-attacks-against-its-critics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quality of their product</a>. Then they have the nerve to lecture us rubes in “Flyover Country” about politics at their <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/115828/trump-derangement-syndrome-hits-the-oscars" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oscars ceremonies</a>, making what was once an entertaining event seem like a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/81815/the-2016-oscars-showed-us-which-lies-the-hollywood-elite-wants-us-to-believe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sociology professor’s sermon</a>. When the subject turns to women’s rights and the welfare of children, they’re bigger hypocrites than televangelists.</p>
<p>There’s one thing the Hollywood types listen to: <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/76356/star-wars-lost-4-2-million-because-of-our-reporting-that-identified-it-as-sjw-propaganda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the bottom line</a>. After reading all of the above, how motivated are you to buy an overpriced ticket for the latest shlockbuster? How willing are you to keep your cable TV subscription which sends royalty checks to them? Their virtue-signaling can buy off the feminists, but it’s time for the public to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98177/how-to-wage-economic-warfare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tune them out</a>.</p>
