<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Globe &amp; Mail author Tama Ward has recently shared an article revealing how her five-year-old Canadian daughter Abigail <a href="https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/life/facts-and-arguments/how-can-i-raise-an-enlightened-child-without-depriving-my-daughter-of-her-culturalroots/article36484338/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&amp;utm_medium=Referrer:+Social+Network+/+Media&amp;utm_campaign=Shared+Web+Article+Links">feels guilt and shame for being white</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At breakfast, in the glass-towered city of Vancouver, five-year-old Abigail looks glumly at her half-eaten bowl of cereal.</p>
<p>“What is it, honey?” I brush the bangs back from her face.</p>
<p>She lets out a big sigh. “I wish I wasn’t white.”</p>
<p>I start. Nothing in the parenting manuals has prepared me for that.</p>
<p>“All we’ve ever done is hurt people,” she continues. “I wish my skin was dark and that I had a culture.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How could a young child have such an acute awareness of her race? It’s not hard when she has a social justice mother who has brainwashed her into loving anything and anyone non-white.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We live in a part of the city where immigrant families abound. Our neighbours are homesick, first-generation Mexicans, which means that salsas and pinatas and Aztec legends feature prominently at shared social gatherings. Our family regularly eats in Little India where we gush over the flavours of curry and dhal, and every February, we attend the <strong>Chinese</strong> New Year parade in the <strong>slanting</strong> rain. Plus, my husband and I are children of missionaries and harbour an acute guilt for the cultural imperialism of our forebears. To compensate, we’ve raised our children with a deep appreciation of non-Western cultures.</p>
<p>So when Abigail laments the colour of her white skin, part of me is programmed to protest. Is it not my moral obligation to tell her that her feelings of poor self-worth are nothing compared with the psychological ruin of real racism? Girl, everything about Canadian culture weighs in your advantage and you have no right to snivel!</p>
<p>Instead, I feel a sadness settle over me. We thought we were raising the enlightened child of the 21st century. We thought we were doing our part in setting the history record straight. Yet, in doing so, it seems we have robbed our oldest child of something primal to psychological health, something elemental to her well-being as a human being: cultural roots.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to say.</p>

<p>Do you really believe her “sadness”? If she truly was sad, she would attempt to right the wrong and teach her daughter to be proud of who she is, but she does nothing of the sort. Instead, she continues to program her with revisionist history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I consider the you-are-Canadian spiel: “part of a new society made up of the vibrancy of many cultures, etc.” Yet, “Canadian” is precisely the problem. What is Canadian? Her best friend is Canadian and Mexican. Her cousin, Canadian and Bengali. Even our Indigenous neighbours have a First Nation before they have Canada. To play the Canadian card will further neuter her culturally when what she’s looking for are deep roots that ground her to a people and place.</p>

<p>The truth is that her article is a way to compete with other liberal moms: “See how much my daughter hates whitey? Your daughter is more likely to be a racist than mine!” This is nothing short of emotional abuse for the child, and I’m sure Canadian psychologists are salivating at the prospect of dealing with the intense identity issues that Abigail and her peers will certainly have when they get older, as Leonard D Neubache <a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-65233-post-1664077.html#pid1664077">from the forum</a> points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s actually pretty sad imagining what it’s like for this kid.</p>
<p>Mum hates white people.<br>
I’m white.<br>
Mum hates me.</p>
<p>“I wish I wasn’t white”, is the kid saying, “I wish I was someone you could actually love.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way that self-hating mothers are harming their children is by taking them <strong>directly</strong> to transsexuals for <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/news/2017/10/17/drag-queen-with-demon-like-horns-reads-to-children-at-michelle-obama-neighborhood-library/">disturbing reading events</a> called Drag Queen Story Hour. One event featured a tranny dressed up as Baphomet, a popular symbol among Satanic worshippers.</p>

<p>If you’re a tranny child molester who happens to be reading this article right now, Drag Queen Story Hour is a great program for you to be in direct contact with potential victims. I have no doubt that we will soon see cases where parents turn a blind eye to their children’s molestation to “destigmatize” pedophilia, which is <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/124824/homosexuality-acceptance-is-leading-to-the-normalization-of-pedophilia">actively being normalized</a>. We also can’t forget to mention mothers subjecting their children, usually sons, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2017/09/07/camille-paglia-transgender-propagandists-committing-child-abuse/">to hormone therapy to change their sex</a>, sharply increasing <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/13173/the-forced-transsexuality-of-david-reimer">their risk of suicide</a>.</p>
<p>With single motherhood on the rise, we may see no limit to what liberal mothers subject their children to in order to announce to the world that they are the most virtuous social justice warrior on the block. It’s too bad that they have ruin the lives of defenseless human lives in the process.</p>
