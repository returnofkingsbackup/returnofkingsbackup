<p>What I’m about to reveal to you will seem counter-intuitive. If you’re the typical nice guy, this might even shock your reality so much that you block it out of your mind because of cognitive dissonance. But just stay with me for a bit, because I’m about to tell you what no one else will: “The Cheat Codes to Tinder”.</p>
<p>This has worked really well for me ever since 2015, when I was living in Manhattan. But I promise you this still works as of now, as I have refined this method a lot ever since I came up with it.</p>
<p>Now keep in mind that you still need to do the usual stuff: swiping right on every girl and then weeding out the fugly ones, maxing out your sexual market value (SMV), and writing a bio that draws the girl in to actually message you first, etc. But in this article I’m gonna discuss the subtle stuff that doesn’t get mentioned a lot. Basically, all I do is use a few unusual tactics that most other people would tell you they’re dumb.</p>
<p>BUT THEY WORK.</p>
<h4><img class="alignnone wp-image-133029" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tinder1.jpg" alt="" width="357" height="654"></h4>
<h4>What you’ve been told about Tinder is wrong</h4>
<p>Before I go into detail, let me explain what the mainstream media (MSM) tells you to do in order to be successful with dating apps and why it is wrong. You’ve seen the noise all over Google:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy-Paste pick-up lines to send girls</li>
<li>Include a pic of a cute dog in your first pic</li>
<li>Make sure to add your height in the bio guys!</li>
<li>Add a Tinder logo to your first pic so it looks like Tinder officially approved you (WTF?)</li>
<li>And on and on with these dumb gimmicks (god I hate MSM)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let me blow you away with one simple question: How many other guys just like you have read those exact same articles and are doing the exact same thing?</p>
<p>If you’ve ever heard of the Pareto Principle, which I go over extensively <a href="http://hookupsonautopilot.com/blog/how-to-start-a-tinder-conversation/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=TinderOnGodMode" rel="nofollow">in my article on how to start a Tinder conversation</a>, you know that 10% of your actions will result in 90% of your major results. This is not just some bullshit some guy in bumblefuck Europe made up. This is real and can be seen in all aspects of life. The ratio can vary (80/20, 90/10, 99/1) but the core concept is the same.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>10% of men sleep with 90% of women (this could be a bit of a generalization but take a look at social media and you’ll notice the majority of men crying about women putting them in the “friend-zone”</li>
<li>10% of people in the world hold 90% of the wealth (again, I’m generalizing but we already know what’s going on these days… just look at the gap between the lower and upper class… there isn’t even going to be a middle class soon in the United States)</li>
</ul>
<p>When 99% of people are doing one thing, you MUST do the 1% everyone else is not doing. This results in ridiculous results and you start experiencing “tail-end phenomena” such as girls messaging you first for sex.</p>

<img class="wp-image-133028 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tinder2.png" alt="" width="272" height="485" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tinder2.png 326w, wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tinder2-168x300.png 168w" sizes="(max-width: 272px) 100vw, 272px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Alexis from Tinder messaged me first because I wrote a dirty sexual fantasy in my bio</p>
</div>
<p>Alright so how does the Pareto principle apply to Tinder and dating apps? Like this: 90% of your biggest results will come from 10% of the tactics you can do. Instead of being Scrooge McDuck and keeping this content from you, I’ve decided to release it (I’m a strong believer in the abundance mentality). Here is the exact 10% that will give you 90% of results:</p>
<h4>Dating App 90-10 Rule Set</h4>
<p><strong>Rule #1:</strong> The number of matches you get doesn’t matter, your conversion rate does.</p>
<p><strong>Rule #2:</strong> Your match quality depends entirely on YOUR PICTURES’ perceived SMV (not yours).</p>
<p><strong>Rule #3:</strong> When it comes to closing, you should have your closing skills on point (the better they are, the fewer matches you need to slay on Tinder)</p>
<p>While everyone else focuses on minutiae, you focus on these three things and perfect them to a T.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Let’s go into detail on this ruleset that has basically revolutionized my dating app game and allowed me to pretty much order girls to my front door like a Grubhub order.</p>
<h4>Rule #1: The number of matches you get doesn’t matter, your conversion rate does</h4>
<p>Have you seen these dumb Tinder blogs that tell you to put a cute dog in your first pic or some kind of outdoors pic? Look, every other guy is doing the exact same thing. While others zig, you zag.</p>
<p>Your goal is not to get 2000 matches that all swiped right on your pic because they thought the dog was cute. Your goal is to get 10 matches with girls who are SEXUALLY INTERESTED in YOU. How do you do that? You use an entirely sexualized Tinder profile. Yes, sexualized pictures (preferably taken by a professional photographer). Oh and contrary to what MSM tells you, shirtless pics DO work. They might not get you 2000 matches, but they will get you 10 matches that will actually show up at your front door and fuck you.<br>
And yes, you will also need a sexual bio.</p>
<p>If you want in-depth info on how to do this, I wrote a <a href="http://hookupsonautopilot.com/blog/how-to-get-tinder-matches-that-dont-flake/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=TinderOnGodMode" rel="nofollow">blog post on How to get Tinder matches that don’t flake.</a></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-53541" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/01/talk-girls-tinder-4.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="411"></p>
<h4>Rule #2: Your match quality depends entirely on YOUR PIC’s perceived SMV (not yours)</h4>
<p>Stop attaching emotions to the way you look and how girls respond to your pics.Look at it as a marketer. In online marketing, there is something called a split test, where you test multiple variables against one another to find the best performing one. From here on, you will be “split-testing” your pics in order to find the best performing one (and no, do not rely on Tinder’s smart photo to do this for you… you need to test various combinations and then start refining further). <a href="http://hookupsonautopilot.com/blog/how-to-be-100-sure-that-your-tinder-pics-will-get-matches/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=TinderOnGodMode" rel="nofollow">Here is a blog post</a> I wrote on how to test your Tinder pics like a marketing wiz.</p>
<h4>Rule #3: When it comes to closing, you should have your closing skills on point (the better they are, the fewer matches you need to slay on Tinder)</h4>
<p>I went out 4 nights a week and took girls home within minutes of meeting them. I approached girls on the street and had my car nearby and just pulled them by telling them there’s a “gay party in Hell’s Kitchen” (I was living in Hell’s Kitchen at the time). This allowed me to escalate in the car and within about three red lights I would kick her out if she wasn’t down.</p>
<p>More importantly, over the years, this made me a fierce closer with escalation skills and gave me a solid understanding of the subtle nuances in body language enabling me to close girls within minutes once I did actually start using Tinder.</p>
<p>DO NOT BE A COUCH POTATO and think you’ll be a “closer” when it comes to Tinder game (you won’t). <a href="http://hookupsonautopilot.com/blog/how-to-escalate-on-girls-without-being-afraid/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_medium=Blog&amp;utm_campaign=TinderOnGodMode" rel="nofollow">Here are some of my infield videos</a> of “street game”.</p>
<p>Once again, your mind is going to tell you to run away after reading this post, and that is basically the instinct the mainstream media and years of social conditioning from a feminism ridden society has instilled upon you.<br>
But don’t give in. Fight that instinct and promise me that you will try ALL THREE of these things for at least two months before you go back to your regular routine.</p>
<p>Again, if you want to be among the top 1% of men who slay from Tinder, you kinda have to do things differently.<br>
So get out there and implement!</p>
<p>P.S. I promise you that 99% of men who read this post will go on about their day trying to get 2000 matches using a cute puppy in their pic. LET THEM DO IT. This strategy is for a unique type of man, the type of man who wants “Hookups On Autopilot.”</p>
