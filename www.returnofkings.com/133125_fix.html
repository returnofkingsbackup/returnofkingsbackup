<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Every year, thousands of people leave their Third World countries in hopes of living in the First World. Some do it illegally, crossing borders without the consent of the nations they’re migrating to. Others do it through proper legal channels, intending one day to become citizens. Much has been said about the negative effects of either kind of immigration for the local population. What doesn’t get said much, however, is how immigration ends up hurting immigrants as well.</p>
<h3>First batch: skilled, hard-working immigrants</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75657 " src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/man-working.jpg" alt="" width="551" height="398"></p>
<p>Wikipedia defines the Third World as “the developing countries of Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa”. These countries have consistently lower life expectancy, higher crime rates, higher infant mortality and a host of other problems. Not wishing to deal with such problems, many leave for more developed nations. While the reasons for leaving are understandable, many fail to see they’ll just be trading one problem for another.</p>
<p>The first waves of Third World immigrants are usually middle class or higher, who can afford private schools back home and have the resources to afford college and residence for their children in the First World. Being among the first to leave their country, they also have more risk tolerance and ambition than most of their fellow countrymen. These are people you’d expect back in their home country to start up companies, drive research, or even run for office. All the potential that could be spent developing their home countries gets shipped abroad instead.</p>
<p>People with the resources, drive, and talent to succeed in their fields leave the homeland that most needs them. So instead of getting entrepreneurs, researchers, and drivers of change in the Third World, you get more people competing for ever decreasing jobs in the First World. Developing countries miss out on their chance to properly develop, making them poorer in the long run. And because these countries continue to worsen, more people keep leaving them, leading to a national death spiral.</p>
<h3>Second batch: not-so-skilled immigrants</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-73618 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/welfare-state.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="427" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/welfare-state.jpg 480w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/welfare-state-300x267.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/welfare-state-262x233.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"></p>
<p>Skilled, competent immigrants can be successful in their new countries and benefit the economy. Their arrival, however, is usually followed by additional waves of immigrants who aren’t quite as valuable. We’re talking about the new arrivals who become leeches on the welfare state. So all the hard work the first batch of migrants are doing becomes nullified by their less productive countrymen who follow in the second batch.</p>
<p>But harm to the economy isn’t the only export of low-skilled migrants. As has been said many times already, they also bring with them a host of cultural problems: increased crime rates, lowered social cohesion, etc. The same problems that made skilled immigrants leave their nations are brought to their new countries.</p>

<h3>Cultural dilution</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89461 " src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Blender.jpg" alt="" width="518" height="362"></p>
<p>Nearly every single time, an immigrant who’s over a certain age will struggle to fully fit in. Even those who come with the intention of embracing their new culture never quite do so. A culture’s customs and traditions become a part of their people. This is specially true outside of the West, as these countries are allowed to feel pride in their homelands.</p>
<p>The elites use this cultural pride as a weapon against the local majority, making minorities into an almost protected class. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/89441/there-is-little-difference-between-immigrants-and-invaders">Again, this has been well covered on this site already</a>. A point that doesn’t get made, however, is that this protected status will only last as long as the elites need them. Once the local majority becomes a minority, the new majority will become targeted.</p>
<p>Third World cultures, for the most part, value the traditional family. The father provides, mother cares for the home, children are raised in values of their parents. If progressives truly means to erase the family and reduce population, these cultures can’t be left alone, lest they reinstate the natural order.</p>
<p>One by one, all cultures will be eroded into mainstream Western culture, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/125697/3-reasons-why-the-corporate-elites-support-mass-immigration">so that everyone can become a mindless consumer</a>. This is already being done to the Third World through American media by encouraging careerism in women, normalizing abortion, and attacking religion. You’d be surprised at how many people in Latin America, for example, already buy into leftist propaganda.</p>
<h3>Everyone is happier at home</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76115 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Home-is-a-castle.jpg" alt="" width="535" height="426" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Home-is-a-castle.jpg 535w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Home-is-a-castle-300x239.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Home-is-a-castle-262x209.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 535px) 100vw, 535px"></p>
<p>Most people would be happier to keep living in their home cultures. Adaption and integration into different societies is a hard process that’s never completed. No matter how ”protected” or ”special” minorities are deemed to be by the elites, they’ll never be fully integrated. Instead, they’ll just get used until deemed an obstacle.</p>
<p>Of course, staying in one’s home country is often easier said than done. For folks in failed states like Venezuela or warring countries like Syria, being asked to stay might sound silly. Why should they not seek to improve their station? Why should they care for what happens to their countries? Leaving home for greener pastures is a personal choice, and you can’t really force someone to stay. While I don’t claim to have an easy solution, the alternative doesn’t seem that great either.</p>
