<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>A harmonious and well-run society relies on the general acceptance of several social norms, a few of which I’ll describe. These were once uncontroversial; fairly instinctively, everyone understood them and considered deviance repugnant. However, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/118398/why-sjws-will-never-get-the-world-they-want" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cultural Marxism</a> now seeks to “deconstruct” them, using recently-created buzzwords to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/104505/western-society-has-become-completely-inverted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reframe normality</a> as something bad. Fair is foul and foul is fair.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, biology disagrees. Typically they’ll use lofty rhetoric about individualism and even human rights. However, breaking out the fife and drums doesn’t change the fact that personal whims aren’t always good for society, or <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/people-should-not-be-allowed-unlimited-personal-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even the individual</a>. Laws of nature don’t go away by wishing reality was different, and social engineering that disregards them brings consequences.</p>
<h3>Gender essentialism</h3>
<div id="attachment_74223" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-74223" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Slutwalk.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="334" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Slutwalk.jpg 640w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Slutwalk-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Slutwalk-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Slutwalk-574x383.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Just some average ladies elegantly showing grace and charm</p>
</div>
<p><strong>What this buzzword means:</strong> There are meaningful differences between the sexes.</p>
<p>When I was three years old, I could observe from among my peers that boys and girls acted differently and had different interests. Later, I understood that these differences complement each other and result from evolutionary biology. Leftist sociologists (less clever than a three year old) claim these differences don’t exist. They argue that everyone is programmed by society—or “<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/its-the-patriarchys-fault" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Patriarchy</a>“, for their new buzzword—into sex-specific roles and behaviors. They cling to this viewpoint, despite extensive research contradicting it.</p>
<p>The “gender is a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95887/the-fantastical-myth-of-gender-and-race-being-social-constructs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social construct</a>” line basically argues that humans are an exception to the biological rule that advanced species have sexual dimorphism. To believe that all differences (beyond a few unimportant anatomical characteristics) result from social conditioning, one also would have to believe that all societies worldwide came up with the idea during prehistoric times—independently, arbitrarily, and with basically the same particulars. Further, one would have to believe that these supposedly irrational customs were maintained everywhere for thousands of years, until the feminists came along and told everyone that we’re doing it all wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences of rejecting normality:</strong> <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/240037/marxist-feminisms-ruined-lives-mallory-millett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Too</a> many <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/111266/five-results-of-50-years-of-feminism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">problems</a> have <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/48312/the-deregulation-of-the-sexual-marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener">resulted</a> from <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/101494/an-open-letter-to-women-who-still-believe-in-feminism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feminism</a> to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/122371/just-another-day-in-the-life-of-an-aging-modern-woman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">describe</a> in <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/women-are-abusive-when-not-socially-constrained" target="_blank" rel="noopener">merely</a> one <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/18/the-end-game-of-feminism-and-cultural-marxism-is-to-eliminate-sex-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a>. I’ll focus on the most relevant item here. Men don’t like <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/117494/4-ways-that-western-women-are-ruining-themselves" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unladylike women</a>, and women don’t like guys who act like <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/3593/7-traits-of-the-male-feminist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spineless emo wimps</a>. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what’s been promoted lately, and it’s making both men and women unhappy.</p>
<h3>Heteronormativity</h3>

</div>
<p><strong>What this buzzword means:</strong> Heterosexuality is normal.</p>
<p>About 96-98% of the public (depending on the survey) is straight. Heterosexuality is default because evolution promotes fertility to ensure species survival. As for the rest, there’s a decent libertarian-style argument for tolerating differences and accepting their right to privacy. That, however, isn’t a good reason to make society bend over backwards (or forwards) to accommodate them in other ways. <em>The tail does not wag the dog.</em></p>
<p>With <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/132151/the-homosexual-movement-began-as-a-communist-bathhouse-front-before-infecting-the-entire-west" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tolerance and acceptance</a> handled, the next step was mandatory celebration; virtue-signaling by politicians and corporations has gone pretty far toward that. The media has been <a href="http://theroadtoemmaus.org/RdLb/22SxSo/PnSx/HSx/SocrdsHowAmerGay.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially instrumental</a>. The public <a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/183383/americans-greatly-overestimate-percent-gay-lesbian.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believes that over 20%</a> of the population is gay; quite a testament to their power to alter perception of reality. The next steps, naturally, are forced participation and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3464222/Gay-couple-feel-dehumanized-Christian-baker-refuses-make-wedding-cake.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">punishing those who disagree</a>. They’ve gone far, but it’s doubtful we’ve seen the end of that.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>If the gay agenda was merely about the right to do private things behind closed doors, it wouldn’t be too controversial. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/65920/pride-parades-a-pathetic-and-detrimental-attempt-at-promoting-gay-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gay parades</a> and social venues aren’t <em>too</em> big a deal either; it’s understandable that they want institutions of their own, and the rest of us aren’t required to participate. However, their agenda has been allowed to go too far: forcing their way into explicitly straight organizations, expecting society to change long-standing customs to cater to them, and even <a href="http://www.missionamerica.com/article/nea-teachers-help-fund-pro-homosexual-groups-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bringing this into schools</a>. This is what happens when heterosexuality isn’t regarded as particularly normal and advantageous.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences of rejecting normality:</strong> In the early 2000s, extremist positions suddenly became incessant demands, things that not even average liberals advocated or wanted previously.</p>
<p>These included <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75203/why-homosexual-marriage-matters-for-straight-men" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gay marriage</a> (an unprecedented alteration), <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/huckabee-denounces-pentagons-focus-on-lgbt-rights-instead-of-isis/article/2565950" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gays in the military</a> (a distraction at best and serious morale problem at worst), and even the <a href="http://www.defendthefamily.com/pfrc/newsarchives.php?id=5310985" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boy Scouts</a> (what <em>possibly</em> could go wrong?) There could’ve been reasonable compromises: civil unions as a parallel institution, all-gay military units (perhaps even a Navy “Love Boat”), and gay camping clubs (18+ please). However, the activists have been telling the public “my way or the highway” and using the courts as a societal battering ram.</p>
<p>There are further consequences too; for a couple of examples, erosion of public morality, and the drain on the public health system from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treating STDs</a> endemic in their <a href="https://carm.org/statistics-homosexual-promiscuity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prolific hookup culture</a>.</p>
<h3>Cisnormativity</h3>
<div id="attachment_121025" style="width: 377px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-121025 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triggered-transdoodle.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="365" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triggered-transdoodle.jpg 483w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triggered-transdoodle-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triggered-transdoodle-300x298.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triggered-transdoodle-262x260.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2017/05/triggered-transdoodle-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Just an average… I’m not sure what this is.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>What this buzzword means:</strong> <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/120993/there-are-only-two-sexes-male-and-female" target="_blank" rel="noopener">There are two sexes</a>, male and female.</p>
<p>Transsexuals are three tenths of the general population, a small fraction of the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/88795/youre-homophobic-if-you-dont-accept-the-new-gay-abbreviation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GLBTQQIAOMGWTF fruit salad</a>. Just as with homosexuals, this is reproductively maladaptive. Of this 0.3% of the public, a far smaller number actually have something biologically wrong with them. For the rare few with genetic disorders, it’s reasonable to be understanding, but that doesn’t necessitate rearranging society in their image.</p>
<p>As for the rest, transsexuals are delusional, considering themselves to be something they’re not. These confused people have been led to believe that their feelings are more real than biology. Enabling this <em>is not compassion</em>, and it certainly doesn’t make sense for society to indulge this neurosis.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences of rejecting normality:</strong> This group delusion has increased considerably, facilitated by the recent bombardment <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/102546/how-mainstream-tv-uses-emotional-triggers-to-sway-political-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from the media</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/111554/todays-youth-are-being-encouraged-to-become-transsexual" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even the schools</a>.</p>
<p>The worst part is what this is <a href="http://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-ideology-harms-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doing to children</a>. Usually kids with “gender dysphoria” <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231780" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow out of this phase</a>. However, lately some have been encouraged to ruin their bodies with puberty-blocking drugs, hormone “therapy”, and even surgery. It began as <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75405/a-modern-day-horror-story-on-the-origin-of-the-transgender-movement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">junk science</a> with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/13173/the-forced-transsexuality-of-david-reimer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disastrous consequences</a>, and remains a horrible form of child abuse. When they start growing up and realize <a href="http://www.sexchangeregret.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what’s been done to them</a>, there’ll be hell to pay.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>An ideology not grounded in reality will not produce good results. A major problem with cultural Marxism is that they don’t know when to stop pushing. It’s about time that we stand up as one and tell them to shut up and quit wrecking our society.</p>
