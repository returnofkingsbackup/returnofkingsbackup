<p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">As the coach of Dismal University’s football team, Coach Patterson is ambitious. Fresh off his stint at a bigger university as an assistant coach, Patterson is anxious to make a name for himself, and his new employer. Unfortunately for Coach Patterson, DU doesn’t have the money or the prestige to be a football powerhouse, so it doesn’t get many exceptional players.</span></span></p>
<p>But our coach can’t abide DU’s continued mediocrity on the field. He starts subjecting his players to an exacting training regime. He erects extraordinary athletic goals, and expects all of his players to meet them. The few extraordinary athletes on the team perform with aplomb, achieving the feats demanded by our coach. But the ordinary players are destined for failure. Unless, that is, they start to use forbidden performance enhancing drugs. Patterson sets his goals so high that most of his players have no hope of staying on the team, without the aid of steroids. Say goodbye to all those raucous football parties, and to those valuable scholarships, if you don’t start juicing.</p>
<p>Deep down, Patterson knows this. He knows the quandary he’s putting his players in. He pays lip service to ‘playing fair,’ and glibly tells his players to ‘seek help’ if they ever need it. But his constant thundering about the need for success at all costs shows where his heart truly lies.</p>
<p>Most would recognize Patterson’s actions as immoral and deserving of punishment. It might even be illegal. Even if the coach technically did not know about the drug use among his charges, he effectively forced his players into cheating. If these players would quit before ever cheating, he might simply replace them, until he had a team composed almost entirely of athletes on steroids. He might not even want to go after the men who are naturally talented any more; after all, if he can obtain the same effect with a less desirable athlete on the right stack of drugs, why compete against all those football powerhouses for the few great naturals?</p>

<p><em><strong> ‘I made a G today’, But you made it in a sleazy way –</strong> Tupac</em></p>
<p>Coach Patterson is not alone. In fact, this situation is probably far more common in the worlds of commerce and government than in sports. It’s practically executive standard operating procedure: make exacting demands of your employees, demands that can only reasonably be met through some cocktail of fraud and theft. Meanwhile, remain studiously ignorant of how they meet these impossible goals. If the fraud ever comes to light, loudly deny executive responsibility and publicly vow that “this does not represent the storied ideals of Americorp, Inc.” Make a show of firing the employees involved, pretend to implement oversight, and ready the next crop of employees to defraud your way to corporate profits.</p>
<p><em><strong>A woman simply is, but a man must become</strong> – Camille Paglia</em></p>
<p>With a <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2009/06/01/sexual-dystopia-a-glimpse-at-the-future/">confluence of factors</a>, women of the West are increasingly drawn to the most audacious men. Men of modest means are left to idle in celibacy. The modern woman finds it irrelevant if a man is monogamous, provided he’s appealing. She’s not interested in marriage “right now,” plus she is so amazing that he won’t want another woman once he has a taste of her – that’s what all those rom-coms promised, anyhow. So the top 1% of men will capture a bigger and bigger share of women. The competition among men to get in that echelon will be stiff. Roosh recently predicted that it will take fame or steroids to get laid in the future – that is our trajectory.</p>

<p>When it comes to selecting a partner, men value femininity, beauty and youth. For long term partners in particular, they look for women with a kind, sweet nature, for women who seem devoted and loyal. Except for a few strained hypotheticals, it’s hard to see how one could lead a woman to evil by rewarding such qualities. In fact, to cultivate these traits in a girl is to improve her character.</p>
<p>Women too respond to certain qualities among the opposite sex. Qualities that, in a sexually liberated era, lead them to quick, unattached sex with men. But these men are not quite the mirror image of the ideal woman. They are by turn narcissistic, Machiavellian, muscular, aggressive and successful. Some of these qualities can be expressed in a good or neutral way, as well as an evil one. Others, like Machiavellianism, are amoral at best, and evil at worst. Even for those traits that are neutral, it’s harder to show them off in a constructive way, so many men will simply opt for destructive bravado. By and large, women simply don’t care if these qualities are used for good or evil, only that they are there. If a man is rich, she will not question too closely how he got that way, only that he actually is rich. If it’s the fruit of a forbidden tree, Eve doesn’t want to know about it. She doesn’t want to risk losing it – she just wants to enjoy it.</p>

<p>After being repeatedly lied to about the true nature of women, some might conclude woman is vile for desiring evil men. But that is to punish her for her God-given nature, to castigate the hawk for preying on the dove. The true question comes in how we are to live with our base natures. In a society in deference to the paternal instinct, known as patriarchy, rewards flow to those with virtue, to men with strength and spine, and to women with beauty and devotion.</p>
<p>A society in deference to the female libido is a society where men are reduced to sociopaths and castrati, where the machiavel is the ultimate expression of man. Judging by the decline in crime, emasculation is the more well-trodden route among today’s men, with their cycle of video games, pornography and social withdrawal. But when men act out violently, it’s important to note the role of the fairer sex, just as our coach was not blameless. <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-03/sp-wdm031810.php">The mere presence of women incites men to danger and risk-taking.</a> Men do not act in a vacuum. If men fight merely for a woman’s favor, is the woman so innocent and blameless? Perhaps, I’m simply late to the party, and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/2090/how-black-america-has-predicted-our-future">black America has already predicted our future</a>.</p>
<p><em>“<strong>Since I cannot prove a lover… I am determined to prove a villain</strong>.” (Richard III)</em></p>
<p>This isn’t what most men want. Even among the most callous lotharios I have known, there is a distinct reluctance on their part. They want to treat women well, they want a woman who would reward them for acting admirably. But they have never known women to reward gentility with sex, only celibacy and emasculation. Notice this in the company of the modern West, and you’ll be branded a pervert and a loser: “Why do you think you deserve to get laid for doing what you’re <em>supposed</em> to do? Creep.” But why expect a man to behave when he gets rewarded for acting out? In an evolutionary sense, celibacy is death – and the machiavel chooses life.</p>

<p><small><sup>1 </sup>This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</small></p>
<p><sup>2 </sup>For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p><sup>3 </sup>Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p><sup>4 </sup>Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p><sup>5 </sup>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p><sup>6 </sup>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts. (2 Timothy 3, King James Version)</p>
