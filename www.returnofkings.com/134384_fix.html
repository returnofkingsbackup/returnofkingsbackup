<p>A New Jersey florist using the “Find My iPhone” app to track down a lost gadget stumbled into a prickly situation — his naked wife in bed with her boss.</p>
<p>And now, the cuckolded hubby is facing up to 15 years in prison for his snooping.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s unjust what they’re doing to me,” Sean Donis, 37, lamented to The Post. “It’s like I’m being punished twice.”</p>
<p>The Clifton man used his cellphone to record two brief videos of the hot-and-heavy session when he confronted his wife and her lover more than a year ago.</p>
<p>He broke down crying when he shared them with The Post.</p>
<p>The first, a seven-second clip, shows Nancy Donis going at it with Albert Lopez in the dimly lit master bedroom of his Rockland County, NY, home on April 15, 2016.</p>
<p>As Sean takes in the seamy spectacle, he exclaims, “Wow!” and Nancy hops off her lover before Sean drops his phone in shock.</p>
<p>The next video, 35 seconds long, shows Nancy and Lopez covering up as Sean berates his wife.</p>
<p>“All on video! All on video! . . . I can’t believe you, Nancy. I can’t believe you,” Sean says.</p>
<p>“Stop. Please, stop. Stop. OK, I get it. I get it. Stop,” she pleads.</p>
<p>Lopez angrily orders him out of the house and the phone gets jostled during an apparent struggle before Sean says, “Don’t worry, I’m leaving,” and the video ends.</p>

<p>Earlier that day, Nancy asked her husband to watch their son, now 5, so she could go to dinner with friends in Elizabeth, NJ, according to Sean.</p>

</div>
<p>At one point during the evening, he noticed the boy’s iPad was missing and activated the “Find My iPhone” app.</p>
<p>The software showed the device traveling toward Rockland, Sean said, stirring fears he had been harboring about Nancy, who at the time worked with Lopez in the billing department at an orthopedics office in Clifton.</p>
<p>“She would hide her phone. I’d touch the phone — she would get very nervous and say, ‘No, don’t touch my phone.’ She’d go to work looking extra pretty. And she lost a lot of weight also,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Sean had his mother watch the boy while he got in his car and followed the signal to Pomona. There, he found Nancy’s Ford Edge parked outside the sprawling home Lopez, 58, owns on a quiet, tree-lined cul-de-sac.</p>
<p>The front door was unlocked, Sean said, so he walked in and headed upstairs, where “I saw what I saw” and “screamed a little bit.”</p>
<p>Nancy, 38, subsequently filed for divorce and her six-year marriage to Sean was dissolved in February, court records show.</p>
<p>But Sean got a July 20 letter informing him a Rockland grand jury had indicted him on charges of felony burglary and unlawful surveillance.</p>
<p>He pleaded not guilty last month and is due back in court on Sept. 20.</p>
<p>Defense lawyer Howard Greenberg predicted Sean would be fully exonerated.</p>
<p>“He commits a trespass that in a sane jurisdiction is a violation and not a crime, and he uncovers the greater evil of his wife screwing some stranger,” Greenberg said. “No jury is going to convict this man of anything, let alone a felony.”</p>
