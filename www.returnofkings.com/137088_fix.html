<p>Fewer than one in five men who suffer a cardiac arrest during sex survive, according to new research.</p>
<p>This is because their partner does not know how to perform a simple, life saving technique, say scientists.</p>
<p>It underlines the importance of teaching CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to the general population, they warned.</p>
<p>Sex is known to trigger a sudden cardiac arrest and this causes the heart to suddenly stop beating. It usually occurs without warning.</p>
<p>The 13-year study of more than 4,500 sudden cardiac arrests (SCAs) in Portland, Oregon, found only a third of cases that occurred during intercourse received ‘bystander CPR’.</p>
<p>It was determined this accounted for the less than 20 per cent of patients who survived to hospital discharge.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-137092" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cpr-2.png" alt="" width="514" height="260" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cpr-2.png 514w, wp-content/uploads/2017/11/cpr-2-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"></p>
<p>Senior study author Dr Sumeet Chugh, associate director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, Los Angeles, said: ‘Even though SCA during sexual activity was witnessed by a partner, bystander CPR was performed in only one third of the cases.</p>
<p>‘These findings highlight the importance of continued efforts to educate the public on the importance of bystander CPR for SCA, irrespective of the circumstance.’</p>
<h4>Doubles chance of survival</h4>
<p>The British Heart Foundation says about 10,000 people die in the UK each year because bystanders do not know how to do CPR if they see someone having a cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>CPR involves giving regular chest compressions to make the heart pump blood around the body. It has been found to double the chance of survival.</p>
<p>Dr Chugh and colleagues showed although the overall risk of having a cardiac arrest during sex is low, death rates are high.</p>

<p>Only a small percentage of cases are related to sexual activity, but survival remains low.</p>
<p>The study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology said this was despite a partner being present.</p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">It results in around 350,000 deaths annually in the US, and about 100,000 in the UK. It is known sex may trigger cardiac arrests.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">So the researchers looked at the community-based Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon SUDS) database from 2002 to 2015 to discover their frequency during or within an hour after sex among over 18s.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">All reported cases were based on emergency medical service reports containing detailed information regarding their cause.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">In total, the researchers identified 4,557 during the study period, of which 34 (0.7%) were linked to sexual activity.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">On average these patients were more likely to be male, middle aged, African-American and have a history of cardiovascular disease, with a majority taking medication for it.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Overall, the researchers said they found a relatively low burden of cardiac arrest in relation to sex.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Most cases were men with a previous history of cardiovascular disease. The researchers also noted some cases after sex may also involve medications, stimulants and alcohol use.</p>
