<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5075981/Mother-nine-ditches-partner-23-years-toyboy.html">Via The Daily Mail</a>:</p>
<p>A mother-of-nine who ditched her children and partner of 23 years for a new life with her African toyboy has been slammed as ‘nasty’ and ‘delusional’.</p>
<p>Heidi Hepworth, 44, from East Boldon in South Tyneside, left husband Andy, also 44, for 30-year-old Mamadou Jallow from Gambia after she started talking to strangers online.</p>
<p>After getting tattoos, booking sunbeds and giving herself a makeover, she flew to Gambia last month – her first ever trip out of the UK.</p>
<p>Heidi has been criticised for her actions on Facebook, with many accusing her of being a bad mother.</p>

<p>One poster wrote: ‘You really are crazy leaving your family for fantasy island.</p>
<p>‘That’s exactly what it’s like. Nothing is real. But your children are. So sad.’</p>
<p>Another said: ‘Whatever you are going through has made you delusional.</p>
<p>‘It’s like a female mid life crisis, but you’ll end up like all the other women who have done the same, taken for a ride, humiliated, used and dumped. ‘</p>
<p>One poster fumed: ‘Oh my god, I can’t believe what I have just read. What kind of person would abandon all her children?</p>
<p>‘I feel sick for them, poor little things having you do this to them. They will be damaged for life.</p>
<p>‘Well done, hope you are happy with yourself.</p>
<p>Another woman said: ‘I understand it is your life… but leaving your babies?’</p>
<p>One woman said: ‘Your poor husband and kids! Fancy leaving them! You ain’t [sic] nothing special and no doubt he’ll be after a passport! Good luck when it all goes t*** up.’</p>
<p>One man wrote: ‘Leaving her husband, I have no issue with. But leaving nine kids? She deserves to be happy of course, but can’t the kids be considered. Best of luck to her and the kids.</p>

<p>One poster said: ‘You are mental… have you not read all the stories. See sense please lady. For you and your kids sake.’</p>
<p>Devastated Andy told The Sun: ‘The person she has become is horrible. She was a loving, caring mum. Now it’s like an alien has possessed her body.</p>
<p>‘He has brainwashed her. It’s one big fantasy for her and she is following it through step by step.’</p>
<p>The couple have six children together and Andy has raised three children Heidi had from a previous marriage as his own.</p>

<p>They were left in the North East while their mother started life with her new partner.</p>
<p>She told the paper her new squeeze was not after her to get a British passport, and insisted he was a nice man.</p>
<p>Heidi said: ‘I’ve met a young gentleman but it’s not an affair. The marriage had problems. We drifted apart. Can a woman not have a new relationship?’</p>
<p>Andy and his wife had been together 18 years when they eventually decided to tie the knot five years ago.</p>
<p>Now, the Navy veteran is convinced their marriage is over having noticed a change in Heidi in March after ‘Asian and African men’ started adding her on social media sites.</p>
<p>‘She was wearing more make up and dresses which she’d never done before. It just wasn’t her,’ he told The Sun.</p>
<p>‘She was going out all the time with friends and was always on her phone.</p>
<p>‘A caring mum wouldn’t go off gallivanting around Africa with her new boyfriend.’</p>
<p>Heidi said she saw her future with Mamadou and her children, despite being almost 3,000 miles away from them.</p>
