<p>I find myself one week into an alleged “LTR” (long term relationship).</p>
<p>After intermittently dating this girl for one month and having shot down a couple “boyfriend proposals”, I gave in – for the first time in years.</p>
<p>The sex is good, I like the girl, and I have been too busy to game of late. That <em>was</em> my rationale, at least.</p>
<p>But after just one week, I know this is not a commitment I can keep. Like many of you, I was born to game. And exclusivity is not an option.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a cute co-worker, the sexy waitress, or a hot body walking down the street – the burning desire to approach, flirt, and bang is ever-present. And this is as it should be.</p>
<h3>The Straw That Broke The Camel’s Back</h3>
<p>I sit at dinner with my new <em>girlfriend</em>. Our waitress approaches.</p>
<p>Sexy long nails, a small, tight body, and devilish eyes – <em>the straw</em>.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the meal basic flirting occurs – and loads of intense eye contact from across the room. As we conclude, I urge my companion to use the restroom – my opportunity to close.</p>
<p>I approach the waitress, ask where the men’s room is… and that is all. During the remainder of the night I run through this scenario in my head ten times. I feel like I did the first time I went out “gaming.” Overcome with regret. Yes, I was out with my girlfriend. But somehow that does not matter. <em>The need to game weighs heavy on my shoulders. </em>My decision is made.</p>

</div>
<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>After a couple hundred or so approaches, I believe we <em>cross the line</em>.</p>
<p>We no longer must use all the willpower we have to push through and approach. We develop the <em>need</em><em>.</em></p>
<p>Instead of feeling knots in your stomach and thinking of excuses – you smirk and begin your advance on the target.</p>
<p>Instead of looking for a way out of your interactions – you push forward for the close.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at your cell phone for hours typing and deleting potential text messages – you send out the same basic thread to arrange a meetup ASAP.</p>
<p>And once you have experienced a complete loop – approach, touch, kiss, bang – you are hooked. The need to game has sprung its root deep inside your core. <em>You have crossed the point of no return.</em></p>
<h3>When To Stop</h3>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Or possibly when you meet someone with whom you are convinced you can spend the rest of your life.</p>
<p>But I will be honest – I don’t know. I don’t have the answer to this question. I am still young.</p>
<p>This brief relapse has triggered something inside of me. A new energy emerges. Maybe we could all use a break here and there.</p>
<p>A break that still involves copious amount of sex, preferably.</p>
