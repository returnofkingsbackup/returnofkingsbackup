<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>The student newspaper of Texas State University <a href="https://www.amren.com/news/2017/11/texas-student-newspaper-blasted-anti-white-dna-abomination-column/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released an op-ed</a> by philosophy major Rudy Martinez on November 28 called “Your DNA is an abomination”. For anyone who doubts that the American university system has become a big leftist indoctrination mill, one needs look no further.</p>
<p>Since then, the article was quickly removed from the <em>University Star</em>‘s online edition. Before it got dropped into the memory hole, it was <a href="https://2kpcwh2r7phz1nq4jj237m22-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DNA_Abomination.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photographed</a>, easily readable with magnification. Here’s what it has to say.</p>
<h4>Rudy Martinez flips his lid</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-127143" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/07/918.png" alt="" width="418" height="435"></p>
<p>It begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now I am become white, destroyer of worlds.”</p>
<p>When I think of all the white people I have ever encountered — whether they’ve been professors, peers, lovers, friends, police officers, et cetera — there is perhaps only a dozen I would consider “decent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The opening sentence is a phrase modified from a quotation in the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>. Ripping off an ancient Aryan classic—gosh, isn’t that cultural appropriation? Anyway, what’s this “lovers” business? This Latino with a chip on his shoulder doesn’t think his own women are good enough? Well, I shouldn’t assume orientation; perhaps he practices the “love that dare not speak its name” with gringos. Either way, that’s pretty pathetic.</p>
<blockquote><p>You were not born white, you became white. You actively remain white. You are estranged from yourself and, in that absence, have been instilled with an allegiance to a country that was never great.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently college exposed him to “whiteness studies” theory. This weird politically correct academic discipline makes “whiteness” into the latest horror, yet strangely pretends it has nothing to do with European genetics. Why it’s named “whiteness studies”—rather than some other of the many “-ism” words leftists have—is an <a href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2015/06/jews-communists-and-genocidal-hate-in-whiteness-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unfathomable (((mystery)))</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In your whiteness, you are granted the luxury of not having to think about race daily. Your heartbeat does not speed up when you get pulled over and find yourself staring at the red-and-blue lights of the fascist foot soldiers we call the police. You don’t leave your home wondering if you will ever come back. You don’t give a damn.</p></blockquote>
<p>Point of fact, cops do make me nervous. Worst case scenario, they can shoot me—sure, it’s extra paperwork on their part, but it would be of little consolation if I’m on a slab in the morgue. Actually, I was “profiled” by a black police officer once, but I’m not mad about it; surely he drew some conclusions about my long hair. In any event, when leftists say that people like me can’t understand the experience of others, they should start taking their own advice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Through the current political climate, in which a white supremacist inhabits the White House and those of his ilk would try to prove otherwise I see white people as an aberration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently he can’t handle <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/100627/trump-presidency-creates-mountains-of-salt-from-butthurt-liberals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his candidate losing</a>. There are <a href="https://infogalactic.com/info/Haloperidol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pills for that</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whiteness will be over because we want it to be. And when it dies, there will be millions of cultural zombies aimlessly wandering across a vastly changed landscape.</p></blockquote>
<p>They already exist; they’re called <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-a-social-justice-warrior-sjw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Social Justice Warriors</a>. The American educational system churns out a new batch every year. Since he’s one of the guys who <a href="https://star.txstate.edu/2017/07/20/dane-powell-is-a-hero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got himself arrested</a> protesting the Trump inauguration, it looks like he’s already well on the way to becoming <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/95868/the-delusional-reality-of-social-justice-warriors-is-a-form-of-mental-illness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another zombie</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ontologically speaking, white death will mean liberation for all. To you <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/99971/friendly-guide-to-roks-world-view-for-recovering-liberals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goodhearted liberals</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/135567/the-black-pill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apathetic nihilists</a> and <a href="https://www.amren.com/tag/race-and-universities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing extremists</a>: accept this death as the first step toward defining yourself as something other than the oppressor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, if someone is dead, there’s not much to accept, now is there? However, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/99919/is-western-civilization-worth-saving" target="_blank" rel="noopener">I’m not interested in death</a>. It’s the leftists who are doomed—their narratives are crumbling, and these zombies won’t walk the earth forever.</p>
<h4>Who approved this?</h4>

<p>My <em>alma mater</em>‘s campus fishwrap was one of thousands of training grounds for future MSM flunkies. Back then, I thought it was the absolute pits. Apparently the record has been surpassed.</p>
<p>Although that article was deleted from the University Star website for preaching the Party Line too openly, one wonders why it was approved in the first place. Denise Cervantes, their editor in chief, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/racist-student-op-ed-pulled-after-condemnation-from-university-president/article/2642160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the following to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The original intent of the column was to comment on the idea of race and racial identities. We acknowledge that the column could have been clearer in its message and that it has caused hurt within our campus community. We apologize and hope that we can move forward to a place of productive dialogue on ways to bring our community together.</p></blockquote>
<p>This almost certainly crossed the desk of their opinions editor, May Oliveira. Her Twitter account is now locked, but contained items such as the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>…in 2017 i need more videos of WoC beating the shit out of disrespectful white ppl</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh, that’s not too inclusive, now is it? As for Martinez himself, he seems <a href="https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/39459/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none too repentant</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The article speaks for itself,” he told <em>The College Fix</em> via email. “… Though my language, especially when I claim to have only ever met ’12 decent white people,’ could be deemed as hyperbolic (just barely), it has accomplished its goal: starting a conversation and outing racists.”</p>
<p>“… Was the piece racist? Nope; racist attitudes come from a position of power,” Martinez added in his email. “The only group who have ever held true power in this nation are those who call themselves ‘white.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, the old “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/132040/4-concepts-sjws-invented-to-shame-white-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prejudice plus power</a>” shtick… Although he’s a philosophy major, it looks like he’s been taking some sociology too.</p>
<blockquote><p>In his email Wednesday to The College Fix, Martinez said that for those who find his column insulting, infuriating or racist, he has some reading recommendations. Namely, Frantz Fanon’s “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116006/the-dysfunction-of-modern-society-is-proof-that-cultural-marxism-works" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wretched of the Earth</a>,” Dr. Huey P. Newton’s “Revolutionary Suicide,” Valerie Solanas’ “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116161/3-feminists-who-caused-the-most-harm-to-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCUM Manifesto</a>” and “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/100706/the-sad-saga-of-john-walker-lindh-rebel-without-a-clue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Autobiography of Malcolm X</a>.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Alyssa Franks provided the cute illustration, “WHITE IS OVER! IF YOU WANT IT”. Oddly, these renegades who want to “eliminate whiteness” don’t practice what they preach. Talk is cheap; they can take the first step by playing with a toaster in the bathtub.</p>
<h4>Whites made the world a better place</h4>

<p>One could dismiss these as rookie journalists who haven’t yet mastered the subtlety they’ll need when they become <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/98243/confessions-of-a-former-journalist-in-the-corrupt-media-establishment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MSM propagandists</a>. (I have a notebook filled with clippings from my student newspaper which are nearly as snotty.) However, this episode points out some serious matters.</p>
<p>Quite likely, neither the writer, opinion editor, nor illustrator had attitudes quite like that before they attended college deep in the heart of Gringo-land. The university system was first developed in the Middle Ages to educate society’s best and brightest. (That was developed by the “dead White European males” that professors complain about today.) Unfortunately, it’s been turned against us, fashioned into a chain of propaganda factories. This is the end result of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/90815/how-the-cultural-marxists-of-the-frankfurt-school-subverted-education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight decades of corruption</a> in higher education.</p>
<p>I might add that around the time of the Columbus voyage, writing by Latin American natives was in its very early stages. The easy to learn Latin alphabet—which you’re seeing now, and which TSU’s students all use—was developed by white guys in Rome. About four decades before Columbus set sail, white guys in Germany invented movable-type printing. Later, more white people invented linotype, electrical generation, computer technology, and the Internet. I’ve barely scratched the surface; Watson and Crick—a couple of White guys—discovered the DNA that Mr. Martinez is complaining about too.</p>
<p>See—we’re not <em>all</em> bad! If whites didn’t exist, then the comfortable lifestyles these pampered college students enjoy wouldn’t exist either. Our technology also brings knowledge from all parts of the world <em>within reach of everyone</em>. Those achievements even enable countless ingrates to browbeat us. These ones in particular might consider transferring from TSU to STFU.</p>
