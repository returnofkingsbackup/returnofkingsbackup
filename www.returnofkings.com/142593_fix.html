<p>An ISIS-inspired would-be suicide bomber set off a homemade explosive device at the Port Authority Bus Terminal subway station Monday morning, seriously wounding himself and injuring three others, law enforcement sources said.</p>
<p>The man — a 27-year-old Brooklyn man identified by high ranking police sources as Akayed Ullah — had wires attached to him and a 5-inch metal pipe bomb and battery pack strapped to his midsection as he walked through the Manhattan transit hub.</p>

<p>The man partially detonated the device, which he was carrying under the right side of his jacket, prematurely inside the passageway to the A, C and E trains at Eighth Avenue and West 42nd Street around 7:40 a.m., sources said.</p>
<p>Police quickly took the man into custody.</p>
<p>Former NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that the man was inspired by ISIS and possibly born in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Bratton, who said the man had been living in the US for seven years, “was supposedly setting the device off in the name of ISIS.”</p>
<p>“So, definitely a terrorist attack, definitely intended,” Bratton said.</p>
<p>The man, who suffered the most serious injuries, was taken to Bellevue Hospital.</p>

<p>Three others suffered non-life-threatening injuries, police said. One person was taken to St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital, another to Mount Sinai and another person was treated at the scene, officials said.</p>

<p>Investigators briefly spoke to the alleged bomber, who told them he made the explosive device at the electrical company where he works.</p>
<p>Emergency personnel flooded the scene following the incident.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio has been briefed on the incident.</p>
<p>The incident sent commuters into a frenzy.</p>
<p>A 911 caller, who would only identify herself as Carmen, told The Post: “I didn’t see anything, I just heard an explosion and I ran out like everyone did to look for the nearest exit.”</p>

<p>“I had like a panic attack, I couldn’t breathe. My stomach started hurting,” the witness said. “I’m doing better — I’m just trying to catch a train to go back home to College Point.”</p>
<p>Designer Chelsea LaSalle tweeted: “holy f–k. just was stuck in a running stampede at port authority bus terminal due to bomb scare. cops EVERYWHERE.”</p>
<p>LaSalle followed up her tweet with another that read: “not a scare. actual explosion moments before i was about to get on the subway.”</p>
<p>Commuter Keith Woodfin tweeted: “I was exiting the Port Authority and the National Guard was running towards something shouting ‘Go, Go, Go.’”</p>
