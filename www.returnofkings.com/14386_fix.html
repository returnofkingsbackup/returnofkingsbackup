<p>I’ve been teaching boot camps in South Korea since 2007 and while there is no doubt that Korean girls are hard, there are a lot of factors at play in Seoul that determine how easy or difficult it will be for any individual guy in any particular situation.  And while you’ll have to hustle, consistently getting Korean girls is very doable.</p>
<h4>How Superficial Are Korean Girls?</h4>
<p>Looks (including fashion) and status carry you a lot further here than in Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. And when I say that, I mean that the bonus you get over the average guy for being attractive is so huge that an average guy will have to put in time and suffer flakes to pull a 7 (by Korean guy standards), while a good looking guy can have that girl call him up when she’s drunk to suggest they hit a love motel together.</p>
<p>Status is similar. I know two guys who had it super easy in Korea. Both were American guys in their mid/late 20s and one worked for Google and the other worked for Groupon. They loved to party and they rolled with Korean guys, and had status because of their work situation. A guy here could be in the midst of being blown out and then if he hands the girl a card that says Samsung on it, things will flip super hard and he’ll have an easy time to get the girl.</p>
<p>Among Korean “pickup artists”, it’s not uncommon to lie, about where they went to school (Seoul National University) or where they work (Samsung) and what car they drive (Mercedes) to get the lay. Since most Korean guys wouldn’t keep seeing a girl who bangs them on the first night, the lying doesn’t much matter. Also, the girl is so drunk she probably can’t remember anyway. That’s the other main tactic. Use status to pull her to your table, then get her so drunk that you can take her wherever.</p>
<h4>What Makes Korea So Hard Is…</h4>
<p>There is no doubt that Korean girls are the hardest in Asia for most guys who end up here. Guys seem to have the easiest time adjusting to China, while Japan gets amazingly easy if you’re shooting for 7s and below, and understand how Japan works.</p>
<p>It’s true that Korean guys are the worst cockblocks in Asia by a wide margin.  And even if a guy just gives a girl the evil eye, that can be enough to make her walk off on you even though he’s a total stranger.  If you’re a black guy, I think you’ll find that non-black lover Korean girls are more open to black guys than non-black lover Thai girls are.  And I think that average black guys don’t have it much harder than average white guys here. Indian guys don’t seem to be at any particular disadvantage either.</p>
<p>The fact is that most every guy (Koreans included) has a hard time getting action from Korean girls. Similar to how the US has the oft broken 3-date rule, Koreans have the 100 days rule which basically says you shouldn’t sleep with a guy until he’s been your boyfriend for 100 days! Of course they violate their rule all the time, but you have a good idea of the mindset. Korean girls don’t seem to lose their virginity until around 22.  One of my guys is dating a girl who is 28, and of her 10 close female friends, 2 are still virgins. A lot of Korean guys still want their wives to be virgins, though that’s changing.</p>

<h4>Where Should I Go To Find Korean Girls in Seoul?</h4>
<p>Both day game and night game in Seoul are awesome. I’d say that most guys who are running both get a pretty even split on the lays they get from day game and night game. Day game is significantly easier because you don’t have to deal with cock blocks and girls are often at coffee shops studying alone or waiting for friends. Also, there are massive volumes of girls in day game.</p>
<p>Generally, Hongdae is the least status conscious area because it’s teeming with what my Korean friends says are the “poor students”. It’s also got the alternative scene and the biggest lesbian club in Seoul. Most foreigners find this to be the easiest place to pull good quality young girls. There are also a lot of bars/clubs that cater to young girls curious about foreigners here.</p>
<p>Itaewon is the next best place, though you’re going to be going for girls that are more in the mid/late 20s and early 30s instead of girls in their early 20s. Much of Itaewon has become quite upscale in the past 3 years or so and it’s starting to be less of a dive bar scene (though there are still plenty of those). Club UN is known for girls who are into black guys, and I even met a girl who got hit in the head with a bottle by another girl who was trying to take her man there.</p>
<p>B-ONE and glam are the spots to go these days.  And along with Helio’s, you’ll find the highest number of white-lover Korean girls, though you will still have to open a lot unless you’re really, really attractive by Korean standards.</p>
<p>Gangnam is by far the most difficult because the girls are both young and hot. It’s teeming with 8+s. It’s true that they are status conscious, and that they are also very image conscious, but most of my guys think it’s worth it and with the volume coming through, as long as you don’t mind getting blown out, you will find girls that hook.</p>
<p>There are a ton of night spots to choose from, but unsurprisingly, the more upscale the place, the more you will get blown out. You don’t need a table to pull as most of the guys dropping big cash with fancy cars also go home alone, but you will get more interaction time. Usually tables are good, because girls’ feet get tired and they want free drinks, so you get a longer opportunity to game sets that hook, which does improve your chances somewhat.</p>
<h4>Here’s the Bottom Line on Getting Korean Women</h4>
<p>The flake rate is atrocious and I recommend massive texting as Korean girls are really much more concerned with how much you like them, than how much they like you.  According to an informal street survey of Korean girls, 40-60 texts PER DAY is the norm between a girl and a guys she’s dating.</p>
<p>Japanese girls have the best faces in Asia, Chinese girls have the biggest tits, Taiwanese girls have a good mix of the Korean bodies and the Japanese faces, but hands down, Korean girls have the best bodies—long legs, and what they call a great “S-line” is common.</p>
<p>Korea is by far the hardest to game in East Asia, but it is very doable and most guys who learn game here will be able to close regularly if they are consistently meeting girls and have solid logistics.  If you find that gaming Korean girls is easy it’s because either: (a) you are good looking to Koreans, (b) you have low standards, or (c) you have high status.</p>
