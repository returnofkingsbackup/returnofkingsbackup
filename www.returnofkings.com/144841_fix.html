<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>A computer company that refuses to do email. That’s what you deal with when you buy from Apple. After a fiasco involving Apple’s AirPods spanning nearly half of a year, I think it’s worth sharing this story as a fair warning to readers.</p>
<p>Not knowing if and when I would return to the United States this year, I purchased a set of AirPods from a reseller in Eastern Europe at the end of July. Of course, no refunds whatsoever was the store policy. I knew it when I bought it, so no big deal—-though one might question <i>why</i> Apple continues to allow resellers to have these policies in foreign countries as opposed to opening their own stores.</p>
<p>Over the next month of using the AirPods, within ten minutes of use, I had a splitting headache. My head would feel full of pressure, like a bubble about to burst. I’d have spells of dizziness and a feeling of being jetlagged, like I’d just gotten off a plane.</p>
<p>At first, I chalked it up to illness. I saw a doctor who told me everything was all and well. I just couldn’t figure out why every day I felt so terrible. It wasn’t until I was working in a coffee shop one day. I put my AirPods in, and within a few minutes later, the pressure in my head started. I realized what was ailing me. I pulled them out. The relief wasn’t instant, and the headache didn’t continue to get worse.</p>
<p>Naturally, I turned to Google and typed in, “Apple Airpods causing pain”. I stumbled upon <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-and-headache-ear-pain.2022765/page-7">this thread</a> (and various others). I made it a point to not use my AirPods for the next week.</p>
<p>The pressure and splitting headache that had been ailing me for the last month never returned (and still hasn’t as of December 2017).</p>
<h4>What Could I Do With My AirPods Causing Pain?</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-144855" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/apple-store-queens-center-mall.png" alt="" width="500" height="362"></p>
<p>I was in a better situation than <a href="https://easterneuropeantravel.com/dating-estonian-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an actual Eastern European citizen</a> would have been, that’s for sure. I didn’t even bother trying to go to the reselling store and explain my issue. Instead, I hit up Apple Support on Twitter and asked what I should do.</p>
<p>It was then that the phone tag hell started. You see, Apple specifically trains each and every one of their agents that <i>they are not supposed to write anything down.</i> This gives them plausible deniability to screw the customers over when it becomes convenient.</p>
<p>So every time I got bumped up the chain (the case ended up with Quality Service Engineering), I was forced to get on the phone. I asked repeatedly to just send me an email with what I needed, and instead was always met with the standard, “This would be best handled over a phone call.”</p>
<h4>Sending Them Back</h4>
<p>Turns out that sending them back to Apple <a href="https://livescandinavia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Europe</a> was a nightmare. It wasn’t possible for me to just walk them back into the store and have the reseller ship it—-no, Apple wanted me to trek all the way out to DHL in the middle of nowhere (I’ve written about it before <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/129169/when-the-little-inconveniences-of-living-abroad-begin-to-add-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>) to mail them myself. Naturally I told them to pound sand.</p>
<p>Then I’d go a week without getting a reply, until finally I was told, in writing (gasp!) that I would be issued a full refund for my problems. Then, that agent had some health issues pop up, and ghosted me for a week. I decided enough was enough, and opened up a credit card dispute for a faulty product.</p>

<p>Said credit card company decided in this case that there was nothing they could do. They sent me back to Apple. By then, I’d booked a <a href="https://kyletrouble.com/the-trip-to-california-was-great-until-i-got-to-california/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flight home to California</a> for the holidays. I figured I’d be able to walk into the nearest Apple store <i>there</i> and just wash my hands of them, and get my money back.</p>
<h4>Of Course It’s Not That Easy</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-144858" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ts.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="313" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ts.jpg 467w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ts-300x201.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/ts-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px"></p>
<p><a href="https://datingabroad.net/episode038/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Since I was crossing a border</a>, I was informed my case would need to go to a new department—-“Customer Relations”. Except, Customer Relations decided to light a torch to our relationship.</p>
<p>Despite having, in writing, that I’d be issued a full refund, that team told me it would no longer be possible. Instead, I’d be offered:</p>
<p>1. A store credit of the retail US price of the AirPods. They refused to give me a credit for the price I paid in Europe (the difference is about $75), on the spot.</p>
<p>2. An appeasement “gift”—-basically, Apple would ship me a new pair of headphones of my choice, I could then “return” those headphones for a store credit. This would require me to hand them in to the store, wait 3-5 business days, and then go back to the store to return them.</p>
<p>3. If I was willing to wait several weeks, a refund—-again, for the US price.</p>
<p>I was unable to get any of this in actual writing because of Apple’s phone call policy, so you’ll just have to take my word on it.</p>
<h4>The Finale</h4>
<p>Long story short: I went into the store, and actually met a couple of very helpful Apple employees who sent me home with a store credit for $300—more than the $225 I paid for the AirPods originally. I turned around and sold that gift card for $284.</p>
<p>Now, let me admit something: I was an idiot. I should have just chucked them in the trash many months ago.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing is that every step along the way, it seemed to me that we were just “one step away” from getting it resolved. In hindsight, I can easily see that this was not worth my time <i>at all</i>. I would have been better off using the AirPods as extra firewood this holiday season.</p>
<p>I don’t think my AirPods were actually defective—-I simply think that the fit of them caused me some serious problems. I also think I’m probably not alone in this, but in any case, what’s done is done. It’ll be the last pair of Apple headphones I ever use, and I’m rueing having bought an iPad earlier in the year.</p>
<p>What’s done is done. Just heed this as a warning if you ever have to deal with Apple on a higher level than basic customer support. It’s probably not worth the <i>headache.</i></p>
