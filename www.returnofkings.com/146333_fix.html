<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Approaching retail assistants working in stores is a subset of day game that is not discussed as frequently as it should be. Department stores are filled with attractive young women who are frequently very bored and receptive to game. If you become proficient at this type of game then it opens up a whole world of opportunities hot girls every time you visit the mall.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that retail assistant game is without its pitfalls. Because the other side of the coin is that such girls are fully aware of their sexual market value and are not unused to getting hit on by hapless customers. As a result, rather like we see with night game, their hauteur is turned up to the max and they will gladly rebuff any half-hearted advance swiftly and brutally.</p>
<p>So what are the key things that you need to know if you’re keen to try retail assistant game? The first is that you must choose the right stores to target. This will obviously depend entirely on your location and what is on offer in your town or city, but for my money large department stores work really well.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-115056" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shop.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shop.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shop-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shop-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>In London we are fortunate enough to have several of these, including the world-famous Harrods and Selfridges.  Both of these are huge expanses of platinum-level retail experience aimed squarely at rich Russian, Chinese, Middle-Eastern and Nigerian customers (as well as a few English aristocrats and hordes of tourists).</p>
<p>In both there is a predominance of hugely attractive, well turned-out young women recruited especially to serve these discerning customers.</p>
<p>You need to find the equivalent in your locale. And if you live in the country then unfortunately as with most types of game this is really weighted towards urban areas, so if you want to reap the rewards you should either consider travelling or relocating entirely.</p>
<p>Once you have chosen your target store, there are several other factors you must bear in mind if you want to be successful.</p>
<p>The first is your presentation—that is, the way you look and the way you are dressed. Bottom line, it has to be good. Very good. Remember that you will be approaching girls who are working in an extremely superficial environment where appearance is everything. And on top of that, if it’s an expensive place they will be used to serving well-off guys who are extremely well-groomed.</p>
<p>As such, before you go out for a retail assistant game session you should spend as much time getting ready as you would if you were going out at night. Make sure your hair is well-cut and styled. Wear well-fitting clothes: they don’t need to be expensive but they do need to accentuate your figure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if it’s cold and you are wearing a coat ensure you choose one that looks good and makes you stand out. I recently had sex with a Serbian store assistant. Afterwards I asked her what is was about me that had impressed her. ‘Your confidence and your Putin-style coat’, she told me. My coat, from the UK men’s store Reiss, is a dark green military number with black furry collars. It is flamboyant enough to differentiate me, and it certainly appealed to this former fashion student and seamstress.</p>
<p>Mention of confidence brings me on to the next point. You have to be confident to properly execute this form of game. Why? Because you are subverting the standard transactional relationship that exists between store assistant and customer. You are effectively saying ‘no, I refuse to allow you to treat me as a customer. I am a man, you are a woman and that is the basis on which we will interact.’ Which is fine, but you need balls to do it well.</p>
<p>How to ensure you have the requisite balls? I have recently had three successes from retail assistant game—the above-mentioned Serbian girl,  a Lithuanian girl who came back to my apartment with on the first date and a Polish girl who I am currently dating. I acquired two of those three phone numbers on the same day, a day during which I walked around Harrods chatting to various sales assistants.</p>

</div>
<p>Clearly, for whatever reason my vibe was particularly ‘on’ that day, presumably as a result of all the cold-approaching I’d been doing throughout the last quarter of 2017. And that is important to keep in mind. Perhaps more than with any other kind of game you need to be on top form to make retail assistant game really sing. If not then you just won’t have the necessary extra juice to cut through the bitch shield crap and stand out.</p>
<p>In view of this, my practice—and the one I would recommend—is that you get at least two or three approaches under your belt before you hit the store. That way you’ll be warmed up and have momentum to carry you through your interactions.</p>
<h3>Be The Lover, Not The Provider</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-146417" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/hot-retail-assistant.jpg" alt="" width="552" height="442"></p>
<p>Another thing to bear in mind is that you should aim to come across as a lover rather than a provider. Retail assistants get hit on all the time by rich, older men who are often married. In London alone it is incredible how many trips to Dubai, Paris and the Caribbean are offered to girls in their twenties by out-of-shape men in their fifties keen to bang them.</p>
<p>With some girls under some circumstances this clearly works, but that is not what we are interested in here. In order to differentiate yourself from such guys you should make it clear in the way you walk up and speak to her that you are not a sugar daddy, but a normal man who wants to get to know her better.</p>
<p>Which leads me on to the age-old question of what you should say. Just recently I’ve been keeping it really simple and really direct with good results. Simply walking up to the girl giving out perfume samples and telling her you couldn’t help but notice that she looks really pretty should be quite sufficient to get a conversation going.</p>
<p>After that I would normally tell her something that I have noticed about her and bust her balls on it. You don’t need to be an expert cold reader to do this. Just tell her that she looks bored, like a naughty kid about to run off as soon as the bell goes, or something silly like that.</p>
<p>If and when she hooks—that is, makes it clear that she’s interested in talking to you—you need to transition into normal conversation. Chit chat about her day will normally be sufficient. Just be natural and drop the over ‘gameiness’.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to bring the conversation to an end and get her phone number. I normally say this:</p>
<p>“So listen, I know you’re at work and you’re extremely busy right now, but another time I’d love to take you for a wine. Let’s exchange details.”</p>
<p>If she’s amenable then she should then indicate to you what contact details she would prefer to give you and how. In some stores it is against the rules for staff to give out their telephone numbers to customers. However,if she tells you her full name then you can add her on Facebook. This is how I got in touch with the Lithuanian girl after our first meeting.</p>
<p>Other girls will be happy to write their phone numbers down for you on a receipt: the important thing is just to play it cool, go with whatever is easiest for her, and above all show discretion. After all, this is her place of work.</p>
