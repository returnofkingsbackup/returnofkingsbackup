<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Here are my ten favorite articles of 2017, listed in chronological order:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/116463/the-decline-in-testosterone-is-destroying-the-basis-of-masculinity">The Decline In Testosterone Is Destroying The Basis Of Masculinity</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Testosterone levels in men are declining worldwide alongside sperm counts. The hormone that makes men men is disappearing from the human world. As a result, men are becoming more feminine and choosing the paths of weakness, homosexuality, and cuckoldry. While it’s necessary to look at the ideological causes of leftism in men, the biological reasons must not be ignored, and that starts with an understanding of the testosterone crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/120712/how-to-save-western-civilization">How To Save Western Civilization</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve had a front-row seat in the culture war for over a decade, but I haven’t made any big policy declarations like other movements. Men’s rights activists their “family law reform” platform. The MGTOW group has “legalize prostitution and invent realistic sex bots.” The alt right has “white ethno-state.” The alt lite has “civic nationalism.” When it comes to policy, I’ve been quiet, solely focusing on fostering truth and masculinity. Only now am I ready to make the commitment to a policy platform which nips the essential problem in the bud in a way that other movements do not. We must repeal women’s suffrage, starting with the 19th Amendment in the United States. Once this is accomplished, no other planned or conscious action must be taken to solve nearly all our societal ills.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/123130/women-who-dont-have-babies-go-crazy">Women Who Don’t Have Babies Go Crazy</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A girl recently told me that she hopes her female dog would breed. Otherwise, the dog may have a false pregnancy where she pretends she is pregnant and shows increasingly unstable behavior. This was the first time I learned about the scientific condition in dogs called pseudopregnancy. I was immediately struck by how similar it is to the behavior of adult human women who don’t have babies, especially ones who live in the affluent West. After studying this condition extensively, I speculate that women who don’t fulfill their biological program of having children exhibit the disturbing signs of false pregnancy by becoming insane.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/125620/the-barbarians-will-solve-your-sterile-existence">The Barbarians Will Solve Your Sterile Existence</a></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why can’t the Muslims, Africans, and Indians be more civilized like people in the West? Why do they insist on endless breeding when their children have no chance of attending an Ivy League university? Isn’t there a way we can help them to see the light of civilization, rationale thinking, and clean hygiene? These are questions you may have asked at some point when looking down on the third-world barbarians, but from the perspective of nature, it’s not them who are the problem. We are the problem. We are the defects of nature that will be eradicated.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/125599/what-ive-learned-about-women-from-my-long-term-relationships">What I’ve Learned About Women From My Long-Term Relationships</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I’d like to share some things I’ve learned about women from the relationships I’ve had. A lot of that experience comes from Eastern European girls, who are more feminine than American girls, but I believe the true nature of women is the same no matter where you go, lurking underneath regardless of outward presentation and behavior.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/127554/you-become-what-you-fight">You Become What You Fight</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Once you declare an idea or person to be your enemy, you give them a room in your mind. Within that room you insert their history, strategies, tactics, strengths, and weaknesses. You dedicate more of your waking hours to understanding how to defeat them. As time passes, items from that room start to leak out into your being, until you look in the mirror and realize that you are not that different from your enemy.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/129776/a-face-that-i-could-love">A Face That I Could Love</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>When I’m hunting, I view a girl who crosses my path from the bottom up. Her legs, after seeing so many thousand pairs, reveal to me her body’s size and shape, even if she’s wearing a long winter coat. I look away if the legs are misshapen or lumpy, not daring to risk accidental eye contact. Otherwise, my eyes move upward, excitedly, to see what kind of chest, face, and hair she has. I then make a snap judgement of her overall condition and if she’s worth my effort.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/131813/the-hunt-for-a-moral-woman">The Hunt For A Moral Woman</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of men I talk to think the best way to find a good girl is to visit a small town or village. The girls will be more pristine, they figure, and they’re generally right about that, but there’s just one big problem: those girls have not been tempted enough for us to know what their true character is.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/135913/women-have-been-tricked-into-living-like-men">Women Have Been Tricked Into Living Like Men</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest travesty that has happened to women in the past 70 years is not misogyny or sexism, but being put on the same education and work timeline as men in spite of having a completely different biology. Millions of women suffer every day because they’re living lives that were designed and optimized for men.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/142479/dating-doesnt-work">Dating Doesn’t Work</a></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>After absorbing the experiences of hundreds of men (and women), it has become clear to me that dating simply doesn’t work for finding a life partner. No other tactic has a greater failure rate in creating stable marriages and families than Western-style dating, a method that only excels in finding short-term sexual partners.</p></blockquote>
