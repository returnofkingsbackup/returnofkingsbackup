<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>As utterly insane as it sounds, it seems possible that the US Government is preparing to try to convince the world that there is an alien invasion about to happen, in the largest “false flag” since 9/11.</p>
<p>You’re probably bursting out laughing now and asking yourself, “Why would Roosh allow such a crackpot to write an article?” and I’d like to preemptively respond by (a) asking you to give me the benefit of the doubt for the course of these 1,000 words, (b) noting that this is just a hypothesis that we will see proven or disproven over the next months, and (c) making clear: I don’t believe in UFOs or alien lifeforms but I do believe that the media puts on large-scale coordinated shows in conjunction with the government.</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why I think the show—which I’ll call the “<em>Aliens (Bio)attack!</em>” Show—is likely to happen over the next months.</p>
<h4>1. The US government is suddenly talking about UFOs</h4>
<p>First, in December, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>NY Times</em> had an expose</a> which argued that (a) the Department of Defense has videos taken by Air Force pilots of what it believes are UFOs (the video is included in the article at that link); (b) the DoD has some of the materials collected from these UFOs secretly that they are studying; (c) the DoD has a secret department dedicated to tracking UFOs; and (d) many high-level people within the DoD, who have access to classified intelligence that we don’t have access to, believe in UFOs.</p>
<p>This leads me to one of only two conclusions: either aliens exist or the US Government wants us to think that aliens exist. I’m going to make an assumption—that may or may not be true but it’s just a belief I have—that either aliens don’t exist or if they do they’re not in contact with the US government.</p>
<p>I’m a bit too scientific, not to mention too skeptical of what the government tells us, to believe in extraterrestrial intelligence. If you believe the US government is in contact with aliens, then click away—the rest of this article isn’t for you. This leaves me with only one conclusion: for some reason, the DoD wants us to think aliens exist. Why would they want to do that?</p>

<h4>2. The media is excited to spread UFO theories</h4>
<p>Second, this article is part of a deluge from the mass media of alien articles over the last months. And we know that the US federal government has deep ties to the press. Just days before the <em>NY Times expose</em>, <em>Newsweek</em> published “<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/alien-life-europa-tectonics-ice-jupiter-moon-735046" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alien Life: Europa Plate Tectonics could be Feeding Life on Icy Jupiter Moon</a>” (Dec 5th 2017) and “<a href="http://www.newsweek.com/do-aliens-exist-many-people-believe-life-outside-earth-despite-zero-proof-742475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Do Aliens Exist?</a>” (Dec 8th 2017), presciently predicting the trend of the month. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=ufo">Google Trends shows</a> how it’s suddenly being spoken about online non-stop out of the blue.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the <a href="https://twitter.com/CIA/status/946460240370843648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIA’s official Twitter account</a> is now tweeting with instructions on <a href="https://twitter.com/CIA/status/946460240370843648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to take photos of UFOs</a>. In October, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/12/12/is-this-visitor-from-beyond-our-solar-system-an-asteroid-or-a-sign-of-life/?utm_term=.efaef2ebc3bb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA claimed that a cylindrical asteroid-like object that they can’t identify</a> is flying 100,000 mph in our solar system, but it is from another solar system, the first time ever an object is in our solar system that originated in a different one. It has apparently been named <em>Oumuamua</em>, which doubly-presciently means “messenger” in Hawaiian.</p>

</div>
<p>All the articles before the expose and the official CIA tweets about it make it harder to argue that it’s just a cool topic for the media to talk about since the expose; it must be deeper than that.</p>
<h4>3. Aliens make for a great external threat that can get citizens to rally behind the government</h4>
<p>Third, it makes sense for the government to do this, from their eyes. It’s a way to unite the entire country (or world) against a common enemy, while also an excuse for a power grab. And an easy way to steal more money—oh, we need vaccines against alien viruses, my friend’s company happens to make them and it will cost $10 billion—but we need it!</p>
<p>Plus, if the deep state is in a war against the President, as seems to be the case, then the deep state probably needs to activate some pretty extreme contingency backup plans it had been planning for a long time. <em>Break glass in case of emergency</em>.</p>
<h4>4. Alien-obsessed Blink 182 singer is deeply connected to the CIA/NSA apparatus</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-146657" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tom_delonge_joe_rogan_experience_aliens.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="351"></p>
<p>Fourth, there’s a <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/conspiracy/will-next-ufo-disclosure-biological-threats-outer-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weird connection with Tom DeLonge</a>, the singer of Blink 182. He just created a UFO-seeking company whose board and advisors are all the first rate CIA/NSA operatives. And he goes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5n_3mnJfHzY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Rogan’s podcast</a> and has a bizarre interview in which he seems to know nothing about UFOs or his new company.</p>
<p>The best synthesis of DeLonge’s weird behavior—creating this UFO company, somehow getting all these top CIA/NSA operatives as his advisors, yet knowing nothing about any of it—is that he’s a front man, trying to use his huge following to bring more widespread acceptance to his “belief” in aliens.</p>
<h4>5. The “aliens attack” plan was long ago revealed through code name Project Blue Beam</h4>
<p>Fifth, there have been conspiracy theories in which people have been whispering about this for decades. Just Google “Project Blue Beam” or “Serge Monast” and many articles, from decades ago, will discuss these multi-decade plans. A good starting point is <a href="http://www.sweetliberty.org/issues/hoax/bluebeam.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a speech Monast gave summarizing Project Blue Beam</a> 20 years ago, shortly before his mysterious death.</p>
<p>Another good starting point is <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Beam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RationalWiki’s page about it</a>, which—although it argues this is a fake conspiracy theory and doesn’t exist—is an excellent summary of the idea. Plus reading and considering both sides of any debate with an open mind is essential to intellectual honesty.</p>
<p>How will it play out? I have no idea. But I’m willing to put forth a testable hypothesis: over 2018, we’re going to see more and more media about aliens, including more top scientists (“Stephen Hawking”—name in quotes on purpose) and Hollywood celebrities believing in UFOs and that they’re coming. This is <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=ufo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">testable using Google Trends</a> to track what’s being discussed online. All this chatter led by the Mainstream Media will build up to some sort of attack, <a href="http://www.thelastamericanvagabond.com/conspiracy/will-next-ufo-disclosure-biological-threats-outer-space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely a bioattack</a>, that may or may not happen in 2018.</p>
<p>Lets see how this plays out, but regardless of whether it happens or not… we live in interesting times.</p>
