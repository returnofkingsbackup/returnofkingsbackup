<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Contemporary rock music is not seldom suffering from politically correct and blue pill messages. Male bands with an emotional angle tend to either worship women or dwell in their supposed weak and pathetic misery. It’s much more uncommon to metaphorically hit the right notes with regard to understanding the <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-true-nature-of-women">true nature of women</a>, and consequently, heterosexual relationships, than the opposite.</p>
<p>However, there are exceptions, especially from a couple of decades ago, even in the mainstream orbit. Below are four rock bands that at least <em>occasionally</em> reach a true understanding of how the <del datetime="2018-01-22T19:35:43+00:00">un</del>fairer sex and many of its members are constituted.</p>
<h3>1. Nine Inch Nails</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-151508" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/161013-_Stern-Trent-Reznor-tease_g7zfgk.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/161013-_Stern-Trent-Reznor-tease_g7zfgk.jpg 2560w, wp-content/uploads/2018/01/161013-_Stern-Trent-Reznor-tease_g7zfgk-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/01/161013-_Stern-Trent-Reznor-tease_g7zfgk-768x512.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2018/01/161013-_Stern-Trent-Reznor-tease_g7zfgk-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>Nine Inch Nails, with the multi-talented Trent Reznor as their founding and only permanent member, became successful with their trademark of somewhat funky industrial rock during the 1990s up until the first decade of the new millennium. Reznor is also known for going from a depressed goth to healthy and fit.</p>
<p>Although the lyrical themes are largely associated with atheism, nihilism, and hedonism, the misery and heavy-hearted songs do sometimes shed light on the intersexual obstacles that stem from women’s malevolent tendencies.</p>
<p>The song “Reptile” from the album <em>The Downward Spiral</em> (1994) includes the following “misogynist” lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She spreads herself wide open to let the insects in<br>
She leaves a trail of honey to show me where she’s been<br>
She has the blood of a reptile just underneath her skin<br>
Seeds from a thousand others drip down from within</p>
<p>Oh my beautiful liar<br>
Oh my precious whore<br>
My disease, my infection<br>
I am so impure<br>
Oh</p>
<p>Give in</p>
<p>Devils speak of the ways in which she’ll manifest<br>
Angels bleed from the tainted touch of my caress<br>
Need to contaminate, to alleviate this loneliness<br>
I now know the depths I reach are limitless</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>2. Tool</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-151511" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/130657.png" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/130657.png 600w, wp-content/uploads/2018/01/130657-300x200.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/01/130657-360x240.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>Tool is another American alternative rock band that has sold millions of copies and still has a large and loyal fanbase. Their sometimes quirky and absurd art attributes may be difficult to grasp for the average hard rock enthusiast, but their huge talent combined with more straightforward parts have made them into shining stars.</p>
<p>In the song “Ænema,” from the album <em>Ænima</em> (1996), the lyrics of the Los Angeles-based group hit the right spot in regards to the celebrity whore and degenerate culture. As all red pill men know, women are predominantly a product of their environments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here in this hopeless fucking hole we call L.A.<br>
The only way to fix it is to flush it all away.<br>
Any fucking time. Any fucking day.<br>
Learn to swim, I’ll see you down in Arizona Bay.</p>

<h3>3. System of a Down</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-151512" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2_system_of_a_down.jpg" alt="" width="526" height="338"></p>
<p>System of a Down is another platinum-selling alternative rock/metal band which has managed to capitalize on the masses’ penchant for heavier yet melodic tunes.</p>
<p>The likewise L.A.-based group, whose members are all of Armenian descent, sings about a variety of topics, including anti-war pamphlets not very different from quasi-commies like Rage Against the Machine, but their song “Lost in Hollywood” (2005) would today be considered homophobic, misogynist, and sexist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They take you and make you,<br>
They look at you in disgusting ways.<br>
You should have never trusted Hollywood.</p>
<p>I was standing on the wall feeling ten feet tall.<br>
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard.</p>
<p>This is my front page. This is my new rage.<br>
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don’t care.</p>
<p>All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s like they were prophetic about the #MeToo movement and what was coming about a decade later.</p>

<h3>4. Glassjaw</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-151514" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glassjaw-1333822075.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glassjaw-1333822075.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glassjaw-1333822075-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/01/glassjaw-1333822075-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>During the nu metal era in the early 2000s, the New York-based group Glassjaw became quite popular, and was produced by the successful Ross Robinson (Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, and others). Their emotional hardcore mainly consists of melancholic songs about lost love, but some of them are based on a true understanding of the urban whore and the frustration it may lead to when dealing with such creatures.</p>
<p>“Pretty Lush”:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can lead a whore to water and you can bet she’ll drink and follow orders</p></blockquote>
<p>“Lovebites and Razorwires”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who you fucking now?<br>
Shut up and swallow my pride for me<br>
Move closer and drive further<br>
So just suck on the end of my dick that cums lead<br>
I’ll be coming for you all (…)</p>
<p>I know a girl<br>
Who sells herself around<br>
And I’m sure one day<br>
She’ll sign autographs in your town</p>
<p>“Who you fucking now?”<br>
You fucking live in shit<br>
You are shit and you eat shit<br>
And you eat shit you fucking whore</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>With the rise of extreme political correctness and social justice warriorism, it’s unlikely that we will see more bands in the mainstream speaking (or rather singing or screaming) the truth about degeneracy and female promiscuity. Rewind only a couple of decades and you may find plenty of good music, all consisting of lyrics that occasionally include interesting themes and accurate descriptions of the opposite sex.</p>
