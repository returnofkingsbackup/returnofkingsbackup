<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liking Beyoncé is much more subtle than having green hair but it’s often an indicator that a woman is an extreme leftist. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve discovered a direct correlation between how much a woman likes Beyoncé and their dedication to cultural Marxism. In this sense Beyoncé serves as a barometer and a warning for men who meet girls that worship her like a golden calf. If the woman you’re interacting with is huge Beyoncé fan, it may be time to abandon ship.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow. Those are some really profound lyrics. I wonder how many globalist corporations it took to come up with that jam?</span></p>
<h3>
<strong>1. Beyoncé and </strong>the basic bitch</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-158591" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-starter-pack.jpg" alt="" width="443" height="613"></p>
<p>Starbucks coffee, pizza, Netflix, and <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé </span> are integral parts of basic bitch culture. If you ask a basic girl who is their favorite artist most of them will you <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> without hesitation.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé </span>herself is a mother married to alpha Jay Z. Her main flaw isn’t her personal life choices, which are successful, but rather the type of fan that she attracts. A typical <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé </span>fan converts their own shortcomings into adoration and says intelligible sentences like; “Oh my god, I wish my life was <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span>” and, “<span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> is like my life.”</p>
<h3><strong>2. If she likes Beyoncé then she probably can’t cook</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-130392" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/09/girl-cooking.jpg" alt="" width="557" height="341"></p>
<p>When I was in college, sorority girls would sing <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé’s </span>“Drunk in Love” at the top of their lungs during their weekly drug and alcohol bender. The girls learned how to get totally shitfaced and “slay” like <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé,</span> but didn’t learn how to cook or clean. This is basic bitch <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> syndrome in a nutshell.</p>
<p>If you meet a woman and she’s a <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> fan, it’s likely she prefers to eat pizza and drink alcohol rather than partake in traditionally feminine activities. I’ve personally dated two girls who paid cash money to attend a <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> concert. Neither one them knew how to cook and both of them used online food ordering services like GrubHub and Seamless.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Beyoncé is the princess of propaganda for leftist causes</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-158577" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/beyonce-dumb.jpg" alt="" width="561" height="347"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé </span>is a false idol used by global elites to indoctrinate the populace into degeneracy. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> is at the forefront of leftist causes like Soros-funded Black Lives Matter and Feminism.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2016 Super Bowl between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers featured Beyoncé performing a Black Lives Matter rally live on television.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The halftime show I thought was ridiculous anyway. I don’t know what the heck it was. A bunch of people bouncing around and all strange things. It was terrible,” said former NYC mayor Rudolph Giuliani of the performance.</span></p>
<p>Black Lives Matter is known to burn down cities, block ambulances, kill, riot, and partake in racially motivated violence when they are instructed to do so by screens.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary Clinton quoted a Beyoncé lyric during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7FJM1qj_og&amp;t=22s">Black Lives Matter Activists</a> when asked, “What’s something you always carry with you?” Clinton responded, “Hot sauce”—an absurd and insatiable lie. Clinton’s response was in reference to Black Lives Matter themed song, “Formation” in which Beyoncé shamelessly panders with the lyric “<i>I got a hot sauce in my bag, swag.”</i></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The video for “Formation” features homosexual black men twerking while Beyoncé brags about taking young black men shopping and getting their songs played on the radio—scenarios only fit for clown world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below is an example of mentally deranged leftists indoctrinating their children into celebrity worship of the golden calf of the millennial age. On the right you will see in gold lettering the phrase; “Feminist Like Beyoncé.”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155233" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-7.22.52-AM.png" alt="" width="496" height="379" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-7.22.52-AM.png 496w, wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-01-at-7.22.52-AM-300x229.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately for this young lad, his Beyoncé-worshipping liberal parents will likely introduce him to hormone blockers in a few short years. All children of liberal parents are in danger of being castrated so their child can be more “diverse” like their favorite idol, Beyoncé. </span></p>
<h3><strong>4. Beyoncé fuels racial hatred</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was in college, Jay Z and Beyoncé were featured in our textbooks. Since that time the cultural Marxist conditioning of the youth has accelerated and college students can now take full on courses on Beyoncé. Kevin Allred, a flamboyant homosexual who publicizes his hatred for white people currently teaches a college course on Beyoncé. </span></p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.kevin-allred.com/bio.html">Kevin’s website:</a></p>
<blockquote><p><em>In 2010, he created the popular college course Politicizing Beyoncé, recognized by Beyoncé herself and her Parkwood team. The course earned world-wide media attention and he’s since taught the curriculum in University classrooms all over the country and traveled the world doing speaking events. His writing has been featured at Salon, Quartz, Huffington Post, the Feminist Wire, Washington Post, the Establishment (among others), and he was a featured contributor on MSNBC’s “So POPular with Janet Mock.”He also hosts the podcast “Bey-Ond Pop Culture.</em></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are some of Kevin’s tweets:</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155231" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-4.55.21-PM.png" alt="" width="392" height="308"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155232" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-4.54.53-PM.png" alt="" width="364" height="197"></p>
<h4><strong>If you’re already in a relationship with a woman who likes Beyoncé</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-158585" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Trump-Beyonce.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="345"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liking Beyoncé is a clear and direct sign the woman you are speaking with is completely indoctrinated. If you’re already dating a girl who likes Beyoncé, it isn’t the end of the world. You can use this to your advantage if caught cheating. </span>Jay Z has been candid about being unfaithful at times during his marriage with <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If caught cheating by a girl who likes Beyoncé, you can rationalize it by comparing her to Beyoncé and telling her to stick by her man despite your alpha male infidelity. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-155238" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-5.58.00-PM.png" alt="" width="414" height="544"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> fans are Obama fans. Obama fans are Soros fans. Soros fans are indoctrinated via cultural Marxism to destroy Western society, culture, and it’s people. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé</span> is their princess of propaganda and she attracts susceptible women into her “Beyhive” cult of worship.</p>
