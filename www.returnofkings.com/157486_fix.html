<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>No film glorifies beta behavior more than Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. The manosphere as we know it really isn’t that old. Return of Kings started in 2012. Ideas like alpha fux/beta bux, cultural degeneracy, and the systematic emasculation of men were blossoming but still wouldn’t be fully developed for a few years.</p>
<p>In hindsight we see that these were always there, but were generally well hidden. However, as time went on they were increasingly exposed. Perhaps the most blatant attempt to emasculate men was to glorify weak men in the media. With its release in 2010, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World was the culmination of the glorification of beta behaviors.</p>
<h3>The Male Lead</h3>
<div id="attachment_157489" style="width: 485px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="size-full wp-image-157489" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Scott-Pilgrim-Michael-Cera.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="265" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Scott-Pilgrim-Michael-Cera.jpg 475w, wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Scott-Pilgrim-Michael-Cera-300x167.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Aren’t you afraid of the punch that’s coming?</p>
</div>
<p>Scott Pilgrim is played by Michael Cera. Now I have no qualms with Michael Cera, but if there was an actor made to play a beta, it’s him.</p>
<p>No muscle. Soft voice. Hipster appearance. He is not threatening in any way. It’s not hard to imagine that his genitals don’t work at all.</p>
<h3>The Female Lead</h3>
<div id="attachment_157490" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-157490 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Scott-Pilgrim-Ramona-Flowers-e1519000308667.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="409"><p class="wp-caption-text">Recognize that look?</p>
</div>
<p>Ramona Flowers is the name of the love interest. Notice that she exhibits all the tell-tale signs. Unnaturally colored hair. Ugly features. Bitchy, sarcastic attitude. Thousand-cock stare. An “I’m so over it” attitude.</p>
<h3>The Plot</h3>
<p>The plot of the movie is the most blatantly beta aspect of the film. Scott Pilgrim sees Ramona Flowers at a party and becomes infatuated with her. He starts to date her, though he already has a girlfriend. His girlfriend is loyal, attractive, Asian, and normal-looking. Eventually he leaves his girlfriend to pursue Ramona.</p>
<div id="attachment_157492" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="size-full wp-image-157492" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Scott-Pilgrim-Knives-e1519000723325.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600"><p class="wp-caption-text">The makers of the film expect us to believe that a man would leave this girl for the purple-haired one</p>
</div>
<p>In order to be with Ramona he must “defeat” her seven evil exes. If seven doesn’t sound like too many to you (and depending on a woman’s age it might not be that bad), the quality of these exes reveals the degeneracy of the character’s life.</p>
<p>Some of her exes are just regular dudes. One of her exes is a woman. That’s a huge red flag we now recognize. Two of her exes are twins. It’s not hard to imagine that these twins treated her to a DP session or two. One of her exes is a Hollywood actor, another an owner of a successful record label.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Based on these exes we can now put together a narrative of this girls dating history. She got some attention for her pink hair and “lovably sarcastic” attitude that fed her ego like a drug. Like drug addicts do, she then needed more attention and excitement. So she started dating girls, and twins. She got successful men.</p>
<p>Now one guy, average at guy at best, is supposed to be able to give her everything she needs to feed her inflated ego and excite her like the twins, girls, and alpha males did? Not likely. And for some reason Scott Pilgrim still pursues her.</p>
<h3>The Glorification</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27538" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/lh1.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="365"></p>
<p>The first thing this movie glorifies is the slutty woman. Ramona Flowers is the subject of pursuit in this film. That pursuit is the central plot. The film glorifies this type of woman. About ten years ago a number films came out starring the “manic-pixie-dream girl” archetype (not a term I invented). Jennifer Aniston in Along Came Polly, Zoe Deschanel in 500 Days of Summer, and Ramona Flowers in Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World are all manic-pixie-dream girls. All these films center around the pursuit of such women by beta males.</p>
<p>Scott Pilgrim also leaves his girlfriend for Ramona. His girlfriend is portrayed as the crazy jealous type. This is the media’s way of devaluing loyalty and fidelity. It also portrays loyal women as less valuable than “interesting” women like the manic-pixie-dream girl Ramona.</p>
<p>Scott Pilgrim is clearly a beta male. Yet somehow he is the love interest of two women, one of whom is so madly in love with him that she is violently jealous of the ugly woman he pursues. In the real world betas don’t even bang the pink-haired loose women, yet somehow this guy has several women interested in him.</p>
<p>Most importantly the film glorifies an idea that one’s past does not matter. Even though Ramona’s exes betray the disgusting past she would prefer to keep secret, it doesn’t matter to Scott. He’s in love and love can conquer the sordid pasts of loose women.</p>
<p>In 2010 the manosphere wasn’t mature enough to call out the beta glorification of movies like this. Unfortunately, men who saw these movies during that time saw characters like these as objects of emulation. You want loyal women and slutty women to want you? Just be a beta like Scott Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Now we know better. When movies that glorify betas and women at the expense of strong men are released we call them out (as was done for <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/143961/star-wars-the-last-jedi-is-one-of-the-worst-films-of-the-decade">this Star Wars movie</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/105100/rogue-one-promises-to-be-an-sjw-sermon-against-white-males">this Star Wars movie</a>).</p>
<p>Hollywood got away with it for a long time. We are still combating the men who took to heart these beta ideas today. By calling out these movies of yesteryear we will hopefully make men influenced by them realize the folly of their ways.</p>
