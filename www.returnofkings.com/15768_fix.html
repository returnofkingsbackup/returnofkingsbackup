<p>In late January, The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/">Red Pill subreddit</a> was created by an anonymous individual who goes by the handle <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/redpillschool">RedPillSchool</a>. In less than 6 months, it passed 10,000 members, and is about to hit 14,000. It has been one of the only places on Reddit where male issues can be discussed without influence from feminists or beta males. But there are three issues that need solving:</p>
<h4>1. Tourists</h4>
<p>If you take a look at <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction">Seddit</a>, a forum for the worst game advice on the internet, you’ll quickly come to the realization that men simply want the magic piece of advice to get their dream girl instead of making structural changes to their beliefs or game. In other words, guys want game without having to run game. From my casual browsing of The Red Pill, I’m starting to see these blue pillers seep in and post beta male statements that get a surprising amount of upvotes. This degrades the discourse. When the The Red Pill first started, over 95% of the content was exclusively red, but now I find myself having to consciously apply a filter to exclude blue pill talking points.</p>
<h4>2. Reddit Feminists</h4>
<p>For whatever reason, the executives of Reddit are highly sympathetic to feminism. They have allowed the <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/society/reddit-pedogeddon-shitredditsays/">SRS group</a> to troll the entire site with impunity. One thing SRS has done is create a troll headquarters called <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/TheBluePill/">The Blue Pill</a>, which is exclusively dedicated to destroying The Red Pill. These trolls are lesbians and transgendered freaks who simply do nothing all day but downvote opinions they don’t like (known on Reddit as “brigading”). Their numbers are high and they seem to have unlimited power to subvert any subreddit they choose. Thanks to their efforts, The <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/">Men’s Rights subreddit</a> has been partially neutered.</p>

</div>
<h4>3. Rapid Growth</h4>
<p>With growth comes problems. The Red Pill is growing so fast that it doesn’t appear people are being smoothly absorbed into the culture. Idiots are trying to contribute without even knowing what the red pill stands for, leading to an decreasing signal to noise ratio. To combat this problem on <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com">my forum</a>, I have limited registration. This stops the flood of people who try to participate without knowing what the forum’s mindset and best practices are.</p>
<p>My forum is also a semi-closed atmosphere. I can keep a close eye on member contributions. It only requires one other moderator besides myself. The Red Pill, however, is wide open and I suspect the moderators are overwhelmed in battling undesirables. As long as The Red Pill remains on the Reddit infrastructure, where feminists have elevated power over them, I remain deeply concerned for its survival. It was a smart move to establish a base off Reddit with the <a href="http://puerarchy.com/">Puerarchy blog</a>, but I believe the problems they are facing will only increase as time goes on.</p>
<p>I’m strongly rooting for their success, but it remains to be seen if they can endure the onslaught that is sure to intensify. It’s going to be a fierce battle.</p>
