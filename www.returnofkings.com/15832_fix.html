<p>There’s no denying that black men have a preference for thick women. Even in Europe with black men straight from Africa, they still go for the girl with strong asses. It’s not that these men are getting rejected by skinny girls and then resigning themselves to thick girls—they go<em> straight for</em> <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>Most black men simply have no interest in petite body types. In Ukraine, a land of super petite women with flat asses, the African man will somehow find the huge ass needle in the haystack. It’s like they have a sixth sense for it (studies must be done to test their sensitive ass antennae).</p>
<p>Some white men on the internet like to mock black men for this. They say they are chubby chasing, dumpster diving, and so on. More severely, the say that black men are elevating the overall attitude of women because of their aggressive game and high approach frequency. But they fail to realize that black men are only raising the attitudes of the big women they approach. Remember: they don’t approach thin women any more than white men do. Unless your target is a bigger girl, black men have no effect on how you will be received by a normal-weighted white girl with an average ass. In fact, hipster white women don’t get approach by black men at all.</p>

<p>Black men are doing white men everywhere a favor by satisfying thick women. Every thick white girl who just got the veiny black snake is that much less likely to cockblock out of sexual frustration. They may not even make it out to the club because of vaginal fatigue. It’s true that these thick women have higher self-esteem thanks to the preference of black men, but if you don’t like thick women, this doesn’t affect you. You shouldn’t be bothered by it.</p>
<p>The last time I was in DC, I fornicated with a thin girl who I suspected was approached often. She told me she wasn’t, in spite of DC’s large black population. The reason? She was petite. The black man’s behavior actually <em>helped </em>me because she could see how she was approached much less than her meatier friends. When I came around to put in an attempt, she received me well and allowed raw dog sex to occur.</p>
<p>If you like thicker women, then yes, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8609/how-thirsty-men-kill-everyones-game">black men are not helping you</a>. In fact, they are messing your game up. You have to intensely compete with them for asses that jiggle and gyrate. But if you’re a white man, it’s doubtful you have this preference, and therefore can blame several other factors for sexual airballs before black guys. Personally, I thank them for distracting a type of girl I don’t want. I will not shame men for going after the type of women they desire… especially when that type isn’t the same as mine.</p>
