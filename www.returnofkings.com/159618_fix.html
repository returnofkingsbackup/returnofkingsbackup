<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>In January we ran a promotion where guest contributors would get paid $10 in Litecoin cryptocurrency for every article we accepted. The resulting articles published <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/archives">in January and February</a> were of high quality and enjoyable to read. Starting for all articles published since March 1, I am instituting a permanent system where guest contributors will be paid $5 in Litecoin for every article of theirs that we publish.</p>
<p>One problem we had with the January promotion is that we received <em>too many </em>articles. Our queue was over thirty articles long when it’s usually less than ten. I don’t have the infrastructure to review and process over five articles a day, so I’m lowering the compensation to $5 to keep the submissions at a level that I can handle. If we need more articles, I will increase the amount, and if we need less, I will decrease it.</p>
<h4>Submit your article</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159620" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charles-bukowski-writing-writer.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charles-bukowski-writing-writer.jpg 540w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/charles-bukowski-writing-writer-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"></p>
<p>Use <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/submit-an-article">our submissions page</a> to submit your article. Here are some tips on how to submit an article that I am likely to accept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article should be between 700-1100 words.</li>
<li>Pick a well-defined topic. It’s better to be narrow in focus than wide since you are limited by word count.</li>
<li>Keep the structure simple: (1) opening paragraph with <em>clear thesis statement</em> that gets the reader interested, (2) main paragraphs with at least three supporting anecdotes, opinions, observations, lessons, or facts, and (3) concluding paragraph that sums it all up.</li>
<li>Get to the main point quickly. Ramble after you’ve stated your thesis, not before.</li>
<li>Try to add at least one anecdote or story about your life to give your article a personal touch. This allows readers to connect with what you’re saying. I don’t accept articles that are academic and detached in tone.</li>
<li>Potential topic ideas: rare dating niches, foreign women, data sheet on a metropolitan city, data sheet on a specific career, misbehaving women, how to make money, masculine hobbies, relationship success or failure stories, interesting book reviews, and picture collages of cultural decline. No Jew/race articles.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re ready to submit, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/submit-an-article">go to our submissions page</a>. It has more details such as your ability to use a pseudonym. Remember to proofread your article!</p>

<p>I will personally review all submissions. If you don’t get a response within a week, your article was rejected. If your article is almost up to standard, I will give guidance on how to improve it.</p>
<h4>How to get paid in Litecoin</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-145231" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/litecoin.jpg" alt="" width="546" height="335"></p>
<p>After your article goes live, you’ll have a private URL to invoice me with your Litecoin address so that I can pay you by the 10th of the following month. For example, if you invoice me in April for an article that went live in April, you will get paid by May 10. If you invoice me in May for an article that went live in April, you will get paid by June 10. You’re also eligible for this bonus if you’re an existing guest contributor who already has a writer’s account (contact me directly for the invoice URL).</p>
<p>To receive payment in Litecoin, you need to create a Litecoin wallet. You can install a wallet on your desktop computer or on your mobile phone. Since we’re dealing with such a small amount of money, you don’t need to go crazy with security.</p>
<h5>Desktop Wallet</h5>
<p>For desktop users, I recommend <a href="https://electrum-ltc.org/">Electrum Litecoin Wallet</a>, which I personally use.</p>
<ul>
<li>Run the software.</li>
<li>Create a new “Standard” wallet (I can also send to SegWit addresses).</li>
<li>Choose the option “Create a new seed.”</li>
<li>Write down and safely store your 12-word seed. It’s the only way you can recover your wallet in the future.</li>
<li>Confirm your 12-word seed on the next screen by typing it in.</li>
<li>Set a password to protect your wallet (optional).</li>
<li>When the program loads, click the Addresses tab to see a list of all your public addresses which you can share to allow you to receive Litecoin. For example, here is what my Litecoin address looks like: LL5XXBi5kuWNTd9Hhn33UY4Fp4FtknFkWi</li>
</ul>
<h5>Mobile Wallet</h5>
<p>For Android users, I recommend the <a href="https://coinomi.com/">Coinomi Wallet</a>, which allows you to store over a dozen different currencies and exchange between them using two external services.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Coinomi <a href="https://coinomi.com/">from their official website</a>. Be careful with spoof websites when it comes to crypto.</li>
<li>Click “+ COINS” to add a Litecoin wallet.</li>
<li>Open your Litecoin wallet and click the Receive tab.</li>
<li>Copy the address at the top of your screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an iPhone, your best option is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/loafwallet-litecoin-wallet/id1119332592?mt=8">Loaf Wallet</a>, which is maintained by the Litecoin Foundation.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the ROK writers who continue to make the site what it is. I look forward to reading your future submissions.</p>
