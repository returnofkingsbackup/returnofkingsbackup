<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>As men enter lucrative positions and ascend up the ladders of success, an increasingly common tactic to derail them is the malicious false allegation.  Modern employment culture places masculine men at the mercy of women with whom they share the workplace.  That, coupled with the fact that human resources and personnel departments are overwhelmingly dominated by women means that masculine men are essentially working behind enemy lines.  Most gainfully employed men should therefore expect to be involved in a case of false allegations as either a witness or an accused party at some point in their careers.</p>
<p>To understand why women make false allegations, one must know it is often due to their realization that they cannot outperform or control a talented male rival. Women know that institutions tend to resolve any dispute between a man and a woman in favor of the woman due to “vaginal privilege” and because employers reason the females are more apt to file expensive lawsuits and make an overall bigger stink.  Such women also view a false allegation is a means to enrich themselves with monetary settlements all while sullying the reputation and professional standing of a rival male.</p>
<p>The #MeToo hysteria is enabling men to finally realize that all but the most exceptional complaints are false, power-snatching, money-grabbing attempts. However, a seldom answered question is how does a man successfully defeat a false accusation from an unscrupulous female at work?</p>
<h3>1.  Recognize your enemies and keep a journal</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-92422 alignnone" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Writer-528-x-350.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="414"></p>
<p>The perceptive male can identify potential false accusers simply by being observant.  That girl who always has a toxic quip, hostility to your mere presence, behaves as if the rules don’t apply to her, or tries to bait you with sexual jokes/innuendo is a prime candidate.  You should make a brief note of each negative encounter with such a woman to include dates and witnesses.  In the event it comes to a false allegation, you can cut and paste those notes into a memo to illustrate a historical context and to mount a strong defense.</p>
<h3> 2.  Remain calm and composed</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-40525 alignnone" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Cool_calm_and_collected.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="356"></p>
<p>If a false allegation is ever lodged against you, it will be quite disconcerting.  You’ll wrack your brain to determine if you did something wrong, and you’ll fluctuate between disbelief and anger.  However, save the rants, shouting, and stress-busting outbursts for your home or the gym.</p>
<p>Your composure, as hard as it will be to keep, remains a very key component of how management and human resources will assess your culpability. If your reactions give them any reason to find you at fault, they will.  So remain, polite, dispassionate, and matter of fact whenever you address the matter.</p>
<h3>3. Treat the accuser kindly and respectfully after the complaint is lodged against you</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-152342 alignnone" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/office-date-1-e1516915658747.png" alt="" width="518" height="387"></p>
<p>Many otherwise unfounded female false accusations later develop 100% legitimacy if it can be shown that you are treating the female any differently, ignoring her, gossiping about her, or basing decisions related to her on her complaint due to the anti-retaliation provision in discrimination law.</p>
<p>Some women know their initial complaint will never hold water but wait for your negative reaction to it to establish a case of unlawful reprisal to discriminatory complaint.  Therefore treat any false allegation against you as a chess match and comport yourself in a manner that protect yourself and your case.</p>

</div>
<h3>4. Hire a labor law attorney to craft your official response to the complaint</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-94347" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-1200x935.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="406" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-1200x935.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-300x234.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-768x599.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-837x652.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-667x520.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-262x204.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer-574x447.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lawyer.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px"></p>
<p>Finding an attorney is a pain and it can be expensive, but trust me, they can save your rear in ways you could never imagine.  Attorneys know the correct language, tone, and tricks to get these complaints dismissed. More importantly, they can assist you in crafting a counter-compliant (against the female or against the employer) which will not only make the lying female’s head spin, but it will provide you with the same retaliation protections which will protect you from being later disciplined or fired.  Moreover, a counter complaint could end up being settled in your favor with your attorneys’ fees paid.</p>
<h3>5. Expect a multitude of shaming tactics on her behalf</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-116611 alignnone" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/03/blame-work-conflict-1200x1200.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="561"></p>
<p>Fully expect colleagues, managers, human resources muckety mucks, and everyone else to take her side initially.  You will hear, “I’m sure she would not just make it up,” or “Just man-up about it and come clean.”  Ignore those shaming attempts as simply the gynocentric impulse springing into action to shame you into easing up on the demonic damsel in distress. March forward undeterred and without apology.</p>
<h3>6. See the case all the way through to the end</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-131765 alignnone" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/marathon-finish.jpg" alt="Marathon Finish" width="556" height="348"></p>
<p>Have your counter complaint reviewed by the EEOC (or state counterpart agency) and be willing to take it to a court of law if need be.  The vast majority of cases settle out of court which is a way to get your attorneys’ fees recouped along with back pay from a denied promotion or opportunity. Most cases take months or even years to be resolved, especially if you have a particularly determined false accuser.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>All men, white, black, Asian, Latino, atheist, Christian, Muslim or otherwise have the right to file or counter-file a workplace discrimination case against anyone, including against females or the institution itself.  Don’t be that fool who’s been misled to believe that only women and minorities have these rights!</p>
<p>False allegations at work are a manifestation of the ongoing war against men.  That being the case, arm yourself with the knowledge to legally beat back any contrived challenge to your professional life and earning power.  Far too many men fail to aggressively act in their defense then later wonder why they were denied promotion, suspended, or outright terminated.  Don’t be that guy.</p>
