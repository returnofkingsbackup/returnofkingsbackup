<p>Women don’t like men who make them laugh – they laugh at the jokes of the men they like. Sorry, funny guys.</p>
<p>There is, however, one way for a funny guy like yourself to leverage his talent into some fresh juicy vaginas. It’s also a damn fun hobby – and the subject of today’s post.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/burr_why_01_v6.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16225" alt="burr_why_01_v6" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/burr_why_01_v6.jpg" width="439" height="329"></a></p>
<p>Stand-up is humanity’s oldest art form.</p>
<p>Comedy clubs are new enough, but human beings have been sitting in the dark and telling each other stories since the dawn of creation. If you’re looking for a creative outlet, an opportunity to teach men in your community about Red Pill ideas, or just another way to get your dick wet, here are three reasons why you should sign up for an amateur night in your city right now.</p>
<p><em><strong>Comedy will get you laid</strong></em></p>
<p>Amateur nights are mostly filled with socially awkward nerds, AKA stand-up comedians and their friends.</p>
<p>But hot girls dig comedy too, and you can’t go wrong when you’re on a stage in front of them with a microphone. Fame will get you laid.</p>
<p>Comedy (and any other sort of fame game) also give you <strong>most effective number close line ever</strong>: “You should come check out my show.”</p>
<p>Comedy also gives you a plethora of great topics to launch into at any point in the seduction process. Talk about the nature of performing in front of a crowd (“It’s a lot of pressure, you’re up there in front of everyone and they’re hanging on every single word and movement”) and give her a nice intense visualization of your high status. Run some Krauser-style <a href="http://krauserpua.com/2011/02/10/intellectual-mastery-1/" target="_blank">Intellectual Mastery Game</a>, and get deep into the nature of humour, and the biological evolution of our ability to perceive it.</p>
<p>When you tell women (or men for that matter) you’re a comic, you are setting them up for an incredibly obvious shit test: “Tell me a joke!” The best way to knock it out of the park is to use <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=8c4_1306857615" target="_blank">Norm Macdonald’s moth joke</a>. Used correctly – make them really pry it out of you – that joke is Shiva, conqueror of rooms.</p>
<p><em><strong>Comedy will tighten up your game</strong></em></p>

<p>Stand up comedy and seduction are very similar.</p>
<p>Crafting a stand-up act is more than just memorizing words. A comic has to script every second of tonality, inflection, body language, and facial expressions. Practicing comedy forces a man to observe himself, and improve every aspect of his communication. Sound familiar, pick-up artists?</p>
<p>Stand-up will also give you lots of opportunities to watch yourself on video. For men whose social skills need work, this will be an extremely valuable and painful experience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Comedy is heresy</strong></em></p>
<p>Among the many illnesses afflicting the progressive mind, its dreadful seriousness is the most painful to observe. Can you even picture a feminist with a sense of humour?</p>
<p>But laughter comes easy to honest and politically incorrect gentlemen such as ourselves.  Stand-up is a fun and effective way to rub the noses of brain-dead leftoids in the stupidity of their beliefs.</p>
<p>If you were to see my act, you would instantly recognize the influence of the Red Pill. Big stars like Joe Rogan, Hannibal Burress, Patrice O’Neal and above all, the great Bill Burr – whether they read <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Heartiste</a>, <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/" target="_blank">Roosh </a>and <a href="http://www.thumotic.com/" target="_blank">Thumotic</a> or not – have stumbled across the same glitches in the matrix as us, and have probably had ten times as much success in bringing those ideas to the masses. As Oscar Wilde said:</p>
<p align="center"><i> “If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they’ll kill you.”</i></p>
<p align="center">– Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>Signing up for an open mic is usually simple enough. You’ll probably get a six-minute set. Put the time in to write, re-write, and re-re-write your jokes, then rehearse the shit out of it. If you’re naturally funny and you prepare, you’ll probably at least have an OK set and get a few laughs. You’ll have fun. Your friends will think you’re hilarious.</p>
<p>If you’re serious about it, stand-up comedy is a tough business to make real money in, but because of the importance of frequent live shows in small venues, it supports a lot more paid work then many other art forms.</p>
<p>So what do you say, champ: Do you want to have some fun, get some girls, and kick sand in the eyes of an unworthy ruling elite? Grab that mic.</p>
