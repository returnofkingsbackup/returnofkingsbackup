<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was ten years old when my father bought the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marshall Mathers LP</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I sat in the passenger’s seat of my father’s black Nissan Altima as he inserted the CD into the car’s stereo while we winded through cold, woodsy, New Hampshire roads. The intro began to play.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He turned the car’s stereo up to full volume.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Then, something happened I would remember for the rest of my life; the beat dropped.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_162501" style="width: 408px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-162501" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eminem.jpg" alt="" width="398" height="396" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eminem.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eminem-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eminem-300x298.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eminem-125x125.jpg 125w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eminem-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 398px) 100vw, 398px"><p class="wp-caption-text">The Marshall Mathers LP was released in the year 2000 and sold 1.75 million copies in its first week of sales. Today, the album is 32-times platinum.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before his reign as Cuckmander-in-Chief, Eminem was a Captain of controversy and titan of uncensored artistic expression. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of his use of the word, “fag,” Eminem was constantly protested by angry LGBT groups. Before SJWs were blocking ambulances, rioting at colleges, and demanding multicultural global communism, they were protesting artists. Little did we know back then, these small radicalized groups would eventually turn into the genderless mobs of hate, intolerance, obesity and homosexuality.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-162507" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-19-at-1.38.49-PM.png" alt="" width="383" height="267" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-19-at-1.38.49-PM.png 383w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-19-at-1.38.49-PM-300x209.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty once attempted to stop Eminem from crossing the Canadian border. Harvard Lawyer Michael Bryant suggested Canada allow Eminem entry only so he could be arrested for violating Canada’s hate crime laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lynne Cheney (wife of Dick Cheney) cited the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marshall Mathers LP</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a Senate Hearing demanding age restrictions on album sales. When describing the song </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kill You</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cheney told the court, Eminem “talks about using O.J.’s machete on women.”</span></p>
<h4><b>The Cuckening</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the height of his career in 2002, Eminem starred in blockbuster movie,<em> 8 Mile. </em> The film is loosely based on his life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eminem’s character B-Rabbit was literally cucked in the film. During a trip to a recording studio, B Rabbit walked in to find his love interest, played by an overdosed Brittany Murphy, getting fucked by one of his African associates. His character’s cucking in <em>8 mile</em> was symbolic of where Eminem’s life and career would head from that point on.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-162509" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8-mile.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="346" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8-mile.jpg 568w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/8-mile-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Forward to 2018. Eminem is no longer the young, angry, artistic alpha male he once was. Today, he is Cuckmander Supreme, Captain Cuck, a Category 5 Cucknado. One must ask, how did this transformation occur? What lead to the cuckening of Slim Shady and what can ROK readers learn from his rise &amp; demise?</span></p>

</div>
<h4><b>Women Lead to his Downfall</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Eminem saw his estranged wife kissing another man in 2001, Eminem pistol-whipped the man and later plead guilty to concealed weapons charges. Eminem often raps about killing his twice-divorced wife Kim.</span></p>

</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The young Eminem was able to turn a negative into a positive by rapping about his issues with his drug addicted single mother, absentee father, and estranged wife. He had so much trouble being bullied and growing up in a low-income single parent home that he made a lucrative career out of his issues. </span></p>
<h4><b>Drug Addiction </b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eminem started acting like his single mother in terms of popping pills. After years of drug abuse, he began to identify with her. Eminem first went to rehab in 2005 because of an addiction to sleeping medication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s no secret I had a drug problem,” he said in <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/eminem-opens-up-about-20-pill-a-day-addiction-200945/">an interview.</a> “If I was to give you a number of Vicodin I would actually take in a day? Anywhere between 10 to 20. Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I don’t even know what I was taking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My doctor told me the amount of methadone I’d taken was equivalent to shooting up four bags of heroin. Even when they told me I almost died, it didn’t click.” </span></p>
<blockquote><p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Cause every time I try to tell ’em “no”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They won’t let me ever let ’em go</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m a sucker all I gotta say</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These drugs really got a hold of me</span></em></p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-162513" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/eminem-proof-2.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="306"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eminem’s childhood best friend, bandmate, hype man, and rapper Proof was shot to death on 8 Mile Road, in Detroit, Michigan on April 11, 2006. This had a profound impact on Eminem and lead him down a path of hardcore pharmaceutical drug abuse.  </span></p>
<h4><b>Stan</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After he became sober, Eminem drew a line in the sand in regards to his fans who support President Trump by dropping some of the weakest lyrics of his career. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_162524" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-162524 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/boomer-rap.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="315" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/boomer-rap.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2018/03/boomer-rap-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“That’s an awfully hot coffee pot. Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not”</p>
</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eminem’s new lyrics are so lame they are immediately posted on CNN—that’s how congruent with the establishment he’s become. A far cry from his heyday, where he would routinely lay down rhymes like:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I ripped her fuckin’ tonsils out and fed her sherbet</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-162558" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-19-at-2.41.38-PM.png" alt="" width="555" height="316"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donald J. Trump is yet to respond to Eminem’s corny raps and probably never will. Eminem is Donald Trump’s Stan and Em is becoming obsessive and weird. Eminem recently attacked the NRA and recorded a song with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/154372/4-reasons-you-shouldnt-date-a-girl-who-likes-beyonce">Beyoncé.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Culturally, he’s cucked, but he’s still super rich and selling a ton of albums. For many, a young, boisterous, rebellious Eminem is the one we choose to remember. Long gone, Eminem is shilling for the establishment as he enters the new genre of Boomer rap.</span></p>
