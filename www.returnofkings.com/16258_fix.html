<p>Few subjects inspire more spirited debate between men than the 1-to-10 scale—the go-to metric for rating a girl’s viability as a sexual partner or arm candy. I’ve literally stayed up all night arguing with buddies about the theoretical underpinnings of the thing—from whether a 10 (“dime”) can actually exist in nature, to the irrelevancy of the <a title="8 Signs You Should Break Up With a Girl" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/7879/8-signs-you-should-break-up-with-a-girl" target="_blank">“potential-girlfriend factor,”</a> to the exact location of the <i>barely bangable</i> line.</p>
<p>I was also single-handedly responsible for having the once-great-but-now-shitty website <em>HotOrNot</em> blocked at my old job, when the IT department invariably realized how much a work-buddy and I would visit the site from my office computer. We’d sit there arguing for 5 minutes about whether a particular girl was a 5 or a 6, only to then discuss <i>why</i> after we’d arrived on a consensus. We’d then repeat the same ritual on the very next girl. This went on for entire afternoons during light days.</p>

<p>It seems like every few months I come across another attempt to settle the debate which, in the end, reeks of reductionism or hubris. This debate will <i>never</i> end because, like sports and politics, the joy is in the disagreement. Comparing women like commodities in a store display is man’s ancient, god-given right, inscribed in the hand of god on the inner walls of his scrotum.</p>
<p>The best we can do is chart the boundaries and features of the debate and hope to arrive on a détente—that we all can live with—so we can sit back down at the desk and keep rating girls.</p>
<h4>The Binary Solution</h4>
<p>This is reductionism at its worst. In sum, the argument goes that <em>“there are only two types of women: bangable and not bangable.”</em> Guys who subscribe to this belief claim to simply rate women as zeroes or ones. The laughable gaps in this logic are too easy, and numerous, to itemize. I usually just counter: that’s like rating a car <em>driveable</em> or not <em>driveable</em>.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/driveable2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16259" alt="driveable2" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/driveable2.jpg"></a></p>
<h4>Asymptotic Theory</h4>
<p>One of the least controversial views is that there is, in fact, no such thing as a 10. A 10, on a 1-to-10 scale, implies <em>perfection</em>, and most guys—particularly those with our sensibilities—<a title="All Girls Are Cheapskates" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/15841/all-girls-are-cheapskates" target="_blank">soundly reject the notion of flawlessness among women</a>. The scale goes in whole numbers (with occasional allowances for halves) until you get to 9. After that, you can <em>approach</em> 10, but you can never reach it. Some guys increase granularity into the tenths after 9 (e.g., 9.2), but that itself is a matter of controversy.</p>
<h4>The Pictorial Concept</h4>
<p>This is a novel solution that has been impressively executed by various sources. While some of the more impressive iterations use methodologies that most men can stand behind—accounting for personal taste, pegging a girl’s rating to the number of “highlights” a she has, and putting pictures to black-and-white abstractions—it still suffers from an array of logical imperfections that keep it from being authoritative (e.g., an over-emphasis on factors under human control, such as makeup or hygiene, rather than a raw score).</p>

</div>
<h4>Extremism, Pride, and Emotion</h4>
<p>A regrettable feature of the 1-to-10 debates is that a lot of guys succumb to emotion in their ratings, rather than producing even-handed, consistent assessments based on logic. I’ve seen guys reflexively rate a girl a “1!” despite the fact that, while unquestionably unattractive, she was a probably no worse than a 3. I’ve also see guys do the opposite, which is no less annoying: declaring a girl “a dime!” when she’s no more than a 7 with an inch of caked-on makeup, high heels, and a Photoshop filter. Guys are also subject to inflate the numbers of their <i>own</i> catches, while holding everyone else’s girls to a higher standard.</p>
<h4>The Bangability Line</h4>
<p>Another matter of contention is settling on the location of the <i>barely bangable</i> line. While I find that a majority of men (myself included) now set that line at 5, others set it as high as 7. Placing the line <em>that</em> high tells me that a man’s scale likely suffers from inflation, with bottlenecking at the very top of the range. The implication—which is rarely true—is that he only bangs 8s and 9s.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nickel07.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16281" alt="nickel07" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/08/nickel07.jpg"></a></p>
<h4>The Embarrassment Metric</h4>
<p>To my knowledge, I’m the originator of this framework, though I’m certain many other guys will be quick to claim it as their own. Because female beauty is a quantifiable commodity that both men and women recognize as a status symbol for the men who can capture it, people’s expected reaction to a girl is <em>as</em> reliable a barometer as we have for objectively measuring a girl. How embarrassed—and conversely, proud—in other words, you’d be at being seen with a girl (especially by your buddies, ex-girlfriends, and haters) is the best way to determine a score.</p>
<p>My personal scale, which is strongly pegged to the <em>Embarrasment Metric</em> and <em>Asymptotic Theory</em> looks like this, summarized:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>0: No Such Thing.</b> Has a dick.</p>
<p><b>1: Hideously Unattractive. </b>A monster. Disfigured or irretrievably mutilated. Has two heads, is missing an eye, etc.</p>
<p><b>2: Very Unattractive.</b> Disproportionate, morbidly obese.</p>
<p><b>3: Unattractive.</b> Ugly, fat, and/or old.</p>
<p><b>4: <i>Almost</i> Bangable.</b> But definitely doesn’t pass the boner test. Still not good-looking.</p>
<p><b>5: Merely Bangable.</b> Barely passes the boner test. You’d be pretty embarrassed to be seen with her.</p>
<p><b>6: <i>Almost</i> Cute.</b> She might be cute if one or two things were different, but they’re not. You may not be <i>super</i>-embarrassed to be seen with her, but you certainly wouldn’t be proud, and you definitely wouldn’t willingly bring her around to anything.</p>
<p><b>7: Solidly Cute.</b> Zero embarrassment, even some nascent pride in being seen with her. You could bring her to things without looking bad, or losing any of the luster on your game.</p>
<p><b>8: Hot-Cute.</b> Would be straight-up proud to be seen with her and/or bring her to things. This is often the sweet spot for long-term relationship material.</p>
<p><b>9: Smoking Hot.</b> This is a girl who can easily monetize her beauty. You’re going <em>out of your way</em> to be seen with her.</p>
<p><b>10: Perfection.</b> A theoretical abstraction that only exists in the laboratory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use halves (.5s) to achieve a little more precision. The idea is that a girl who’s <em>almost</em> at that next level—but doesn’t <i>quite</i> have it takes to get the rating outright—will get a .5. I’ll also occasionally grant (or deduct) halves for “intangibles”—things like extraordinary sweetness (or bitchiness), a sexy vibe (or awkwardness), or a personal preference (though I’m quick to disclose the latter).</p>
<p>Judicious and honest application of the 1-to-10 scale is an essential part of guy talk. I doubt we’ll ever fully agree but—whether you accept my version, somebody else’s, or have your own exotic A-to-Z scale—strive for consistency and responsibility in your ratings.</p>
