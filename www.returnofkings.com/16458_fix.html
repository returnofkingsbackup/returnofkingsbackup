<p>Kurt Vonnegut Jr., a famous author and avowed socialist, also happened to pen a very clever critique of social equality. In the short sci-fi story <a href="http://www.tnellen.com/cybereng/harrison.html"><em>Harrison Bergeron</em></a>, Vonnegut portrays a world where technology is used to make sure everyone is the same. For example, the beautiful must wear masks, the fast must wear ball bearings, and the intelligent must wear loud speakers that blare relentless noise into their ears every so often in order to disrupt any complex thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George and Hazel were watching television. There were tears on Hazel’s cheeks, but she’d forgotten for the moment what they were about.</p>
<p>On the television screen were ballerinas.</p>
<p>A buzzer sounded in George’s head. His thoughts fled in panic, like bandits from a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>“That was a real pretty dance, that dance they just did,” said Hazel.</p>
<p>“Huh” said George.</p>
<p>“That dance-it was nice,” said Hazel.</p>
<p>“Yup,” said George. He tried to think a little about the ballerinas. They weren’t really very good-no better than anybody else would have been, anyway. They were burdened with sashweights and bags of birdshot, and their faces were masked, so that no one, seeing a free and graceful gesture or a pretty face, would feel like something the cat drug in. George was toying with the vague notion that maybe dancers shouldn’t be handicapped. But he didn’t get very far with it before another noise in his ear radio scattered his thoughts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story continues with imaginings of what a world where everyone is equalized would look like. The reader is unable to sympathize with the characters however, because the characters themselves are unable to feel sadness. However, the reader isn’t aware of this fact before he is presented with the genius of Harrison Bergeron who escaped from jail but made his way to national television.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clanking, clownish, and huge, Harrison stood – in the center of the studio. The knob of the uprooted studio door was still in his hand. Ballerinas, technicians, musicians, and announcers cowered on their knees before him, expecting to die.</p>
<p>“I am the Emperor!” cried Harrison. “Do you hear? I am the Emperor! Everybody must do what I say at once!” He stamped his foot and the studio shook.</p>

<p>“Even as I stand here” he bellowed, “crippled, hobbled, sickened – I am a greater ruler than any man who ever lived! Now watch me become what I can become!”</p>
<p>Harrison tore the straps of his handicap harness like wet tissue paper, tore straps guaranteed to support five thousand pounds.</p>
<p>Harrison’s scrap-iron handicaps crashed to the floor.</p>
<p>Harrison thrust his thumbs under the bar of the padlock that secured his head harness. The bar snapped like celery. Harrison smashed his headphones and spectacles against the wall.</p>
<p>He flung away his rubber-ball nose, revealed a man that would have awed Thor, the god of thunder.</p>
<p>“I shall now select my Empress!” he said, looking down on the cowering people. “Let the first woman who dares rise to her feet claim her mate and her throne!”</p>
<p>A moment passed, and then a ballerina arose, swaying like a willow.</p>
<p>Harrison plucked the mental handicap from her ear, snapped off her physical handicaps with marvelous delicacy. Last of all he removed her mask.</p>
<p>She was blindingly beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won’t spoil the ending of the story here, but instead make a remark on the nature of equality. There is an old Christian quote that goes, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” Likewise, I would ask to those who believe in equality, “For what shall it profit society, if it should eliminate injustice, and lose everything great?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George came back in with the beer, paused while a handicap signal shook him up. And then he sat down again. “You been crying” he said to Hazel.</p>
<p>“Yup,” she said.</p>
<p>“What about?” he said.</p>
<p>“I forget,” she said. “Something real sad on television.”</p>
<p>“What was it?” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s all kind of mixed up in my mind,” said Hazel.</p>
<p>“Forget sad things,” said George.</p>
<p>“I always do,” said Hazel.</p>
