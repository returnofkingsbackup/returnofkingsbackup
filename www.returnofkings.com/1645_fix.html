<p class="cb-author-bio">Edward was a weekly contributor at Return of Kings until he passed away unexpectedly after being crushed to death under the weight of his own massive ego. Tall, devastatingly handsome, witty, and successful; the poor lad just couldn’t handle the supreme awesomeness of his own being. May he rest in peace.</p>

<p><strong>Want to learn how to be a good pimp? Tune in to the “This American Whore” podcast.</strong></p>
<p><em>“[…] her audience now is mainly those in the sex worker community, but [she] hopes this will change: ‘I want the world to be my main audience because I think whores are important and what whores have to say is important.’</em></p>
<p><em>This American Whore will be tackling a variety of topics in the next few months, such as how to be a good partner to a sex worker, and with upcoming guests like Kitty Stryker and Carol Queen. Q hopes by humanizing a marginalized community, it will help to end oppression and ignorance.”</em></p>
<p>Hey, whatever works. More power to her. I’m glad there’ll be a few classy whores around when I’m 80. <a href="http://blogs.sfweekly.com/exhibitionist/2012/12/this_american_whore_siouxsie_q_sex_work.php" target="_blank">Read the article here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>So-called nice guy? Meet the so-called friend zone.</strong></p>
<p>According to a recent article at Jezebel, <em>“Obviously; rule number one of being a real nice guy is that you never, </em><em>ever</em><em> refer to yourself as a ‘nice guy.’”</em></p>
<p>That’s funny. I’ve noticed that strong, independent, relevant women never ever refer to themselves as “strong, independent, relevant women” either. That little nugget works both ways. Imagine that.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://jezebel.com/5969737/meet-the-so+called-nice-guys-of-okcupid" target="_blank">read the strong, independent, relevant article here</a>, or check out the Nice Guys of OKCupid tumblr blog referenced in the article <a href="http://niceguysofokc.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Alimony laws need to be reformed, because they affect women too.</strong></p>
<p><em>“Alimony is not a gender issue as both men and woman are forced into paying permanent alimony against their economic capabilities and will. Many of the protestors at this event were women who were highly impacted by alimony and who support reform.”</em></p>
<p>Oh. Em. Gee. I cannot believe this type of nonsense affects women too! If you’re as upset about this as I am, you can <a href="http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/style/alimony-reformers-persistent-and-resilient-in-new-jersey" target="_blank">read the article here</a>.</p>

<p><em>“My hope is that with the call for more responsible gun laws we might in the same courageous breath witness the misogyny of his act because it provides a key for unlocking any sense of “mystery” of how this could have happened and understand that women are often on the receiving end of hatred, however subtle or however much of an “aside” it might seem. This is an important point, I think, because if we are to rid ourselves of misogyny we have to trace it to its root cause; and when we do we find ourselves at the striking at the root of all acts of such violence.”</em></p>
<p>She reminds me of those retarded kids in Sunday School class who thought the answer to everything was “Jesus.” If you want to read more on why “misogyny” is the answer to everything, <a href="http://www.huntingtonnews.net/51750" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Attention ladies: There are new rules for dating, and they’re not you mother’s rules!</strong></p>
<p>Hey ladies, the unbelievably gifted duo who brought you “The Rules” have followed it up with a book out called “Not Your Mother’s Rules: The New Secrets for Dating.” I suggest you drop whatever you’re doing and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Not-Your-Mothers-Rules-Secrets/dp/1455512583" target="_blank">pick yourself up a copy</a>. Go ahead! Do something nice for yourself! It’s the perfect Christmas gift for the gal who already has everything but doesn’t know it.</p>
<p>Here’s a little sampling of one of the new and improved rules:</p>
<p><em>“A woman cannot e-mail, or even wink at a guy’s profile, without becoming the aggressor and possibly getting hurt down the line when the guy dumps her for the woman whose profile he really likes. The only way to be sure that a guy is interested is to let him make the first move.”</em></p>
<p>Groundbreaking. Before this book was published, my Match.com in-box was literally filled with dozens of beautiful women begging to sex me up. But now that the new magna carta of the sexual revolution is on the shelf, I have to send 20 emails just to get one or two responses.</p>

<p><strong>Study shows some black chicks won’t exercise because of their hair.</strong></p>
<p><em>“This topic certainly bears further research, but McMichael suggests that the amount of time and money some African-American women traditionally invest in frequent salon visits may deter them from sweaty physical activities that could ruin their hair treatments.”</em></p>
<p>I’m not touching this article with a 10-inch pole. 🙂 But you can <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2012/12/study-some-black-women-choose-hair-over-the-gym.html" target="_blank">read the article here</a>.</p>
