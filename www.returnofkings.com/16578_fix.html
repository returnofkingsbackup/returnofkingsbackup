<h4>A Dilemma</h4>
<p>A man must choose wisely as to where he takes a woman when it’s time to move furniture. Some argue that it is best to take a woman back to your place. Others espouse the merits of going to her place. There are pros and cons to each but I’m an advocate for going to her place over having her come to yours.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/choosewiselyq.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16912" alt="choosewiselyq" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/choosewiselyq.jpg"></a></p>
<h4>Your Place</h4>
<p>While having a woman at your place is familiar territory, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. The only real advantage having her come to your place aside from showing off any expensive things you have is the convenience of getting ready for the next day in the morning. The pitfalls of allowing woman your house are immense. One major problem of having a woman stay over your houses it’s hard to get them to leave. A wise man once said “get the fuck out after you’re done.”  Another problem is she will go through your stuff. I have sensitive items, things that go bang, and expensive things I don’t want to lose laying around. Also it gives the opportunity for women to leave things behind in order to concoct an excuse to come back over your house and/or tip off other woman you might bring back that she had been there. This can all be avoided by going to her place.</p>
<h4>Her Place</h4>
<p>When going over a woman’s house all you have to keep track of is yourself and your property you have with you at the time. A good technique  is to have a small messenger bag to hold your items so it is quick and easy to verify you have everything on the way out. Also by putting things in the bag it makes it harder for her to snoop through things without detection. Also this bag can be used as your road kit with a change of clothes, condoms, drop gun, and anything else you might need for a night on the town.</p>
<p>When you go to her place, you can see what kind of person she is. You can see if she’s messy. You can see how dirty she is. You can see how crazy she is by how many cats she has. Good places to check are trashcans, medicine cabinets, and nightstand drawers. Nothing is more of a buzz kill than a Valtrex prescription or trashcan full of pregnancy tests.</p>

<p>One advantage of going to the woman’s place is you get to try new things. Women like to buy lots of soaps and shampoos so you can find the one that is best for you for free by sampling many women’s houses. I don’t really use the shampoos after reading the ROK article on baking soda. Same thing goes for food in her fridge, so make sure you keep room in your bag for things you might want to take with you when you leave. Using your overnight bag as a swag bag helps the environment through reuse.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lol.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-16913" alt="lol" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/lol.jpg" width="359" height="323"></a></p>
<p>Another advantage of going to the woman’s place is you set the timetable for when its time to go home. For example you might want to blast out real quick if you want to go to another bar before last call. You might want to stay for round two if it was good. You might want to stay for brunch if it was great. You really can’t pull the old “dip out while she’s in the bathroom like Batman” at your own house.</p>
<p>One great advantage of going to the woman’s place is that other women don’t know that location. You don’t have to worry about Molly knocking on the door while you and Sally are handling business. You also don’t have to worry about your neighbors observing your behavior. This will lead to your house being a drama free location.</p>
<h4>Words to Remember</h4>
<p>Don’t forget there are a few things you should remember. Always have a lock on your phone. Always flush the condom down the toilet. Check yourself in the mirror for any marks, scratches or lipstick. Remember as R’as al-Gul said, “leave no sign”.</p>
