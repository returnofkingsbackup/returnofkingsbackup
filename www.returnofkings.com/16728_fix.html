<p>That, or a variation of that conclusory statement, is what various girls told me after hearing I was going to Russia for an extended period of time.  My sister told me to be careful because they are evil girls. My mom told me that’s what she heard about Russian girls from men she’s talked to. A female friend of mine from a Western European country stated to me that they are all whores and prostitutes. Even the girls I dated in Ukraine would tell me how horrible Russian girls are.</p>
<p>So were they right? Absolutely not. And after my six weeks in Russia this summer I found out why so many girls hated on their Russian sisters… they just simply can’t compete.</p>
<p>In almost every way I can think of, Russian girls surpass their competition. Even though six weeks is hardly sufficient time to make such a bold claim as I just did, I have traveled enough and spent enough time chasing/dating/fornicating foreign women that I think I can make some judgments.</p>
<h4>Looks</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://online-russian.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/russian-girls.jpg" width="420" height="328"></p>
<p>There is no escaping the importance of aesthetics. Despite being subjective in nature, there are certain things most men can agree on and mind-blowing beauty is one of them. Moreso in Moscow but still existent in some of the other cities I visited, you are exposed to girls that are simply astonishing. Day, night, subway, the club, the park, wherever. Two times in my life I’ve just completely lost the ability to approach girls because of shock. Both times were in Moscow.</p>
<p>Sure, there are gorgeous girls everywhere in the world.  The high-end Brazilian girls are amazing.  But the higher-end Russians are higher.  Argentina has many many hot sexy girls walking around. But they come at a higher frequency in Russia.</p>
<p>Their Ukrainian sisters can compete… and compete well. But they still come up short.  Both Ukrainian and Russian girls have sexy, thin and tall bodies. But Russian girls have tits and asses too.  Russian girls also have no teeth or acne issues, which is commonly a problem with Ukrainian girls.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure I don’t have to explain the comparison to American girls…</p>
<h4>Sophistication</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="../24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lq9gasWbZg1qeqc9fo1_500.jpg" width="400" height="391"></p>
<p>Whereas going on a date with an American girl is an exercise of restraint in either offing yourself or reaching over and slapping her for her idiocy, and dating a Ukrainian girl is sometimes the equivalent of dating a cardboard box in a dress and heels, Russian girls are interesting, fun and entertaining to be with. The students you date seem more mature than most girls you’ve dated in the past. The working class girls show up to a date as if they were attending a wedding, and instead of bitching about their bosses they compliment you and ask how your day was. Most if not all have interesting stories to tell.</p>
<p>These girls have actual skills, whether being able to sing, draw, know a different language, or tell you about the latest nonfiction book they are reading. And you sit there, staring at the long hair and sexy dress and wonder how this is possible. I won’t forget the girl who could win most reality show singing competitions serenading my friend and me at 6:00 a.m., then sleeping for an hour before waking up to go to the market to have breakfast prepared for when we wake up.  Or the girl who started showing me paintings she drew that could battle for space at a museum.</p>
<p>I will even go a step further and say that their sophistication in evil is higher. Ukrainian girls for example are some sneaky and devious bitches, but it is at a basic level. I had a Ukrainian girl I dated tell me she is going to Greece with “her friend” who is female. I could care less, but for fun I told her to send me a picture of them two together. She couldn’t as she obviously was there with a guy. I got every excuse in the book on why she couldn’t, from they are “not that close of friends to take pictures together” to “how dare I not trust her.”  It was quite funny.</p>

<p>Compare that to a Russian girl’s conniving. Most Russian girls I met were incredibly sweet and gentle (until time for sex). Nonetheless, the tricky ones can really be tricky. I will be the first to admit I got duped by what seemed to be a sweet, innocent 18 year old. She invited me out to a club, greeted me with some champagne upon arrival, and was wearing a sexy white dress. She was all over me, a smart tactic to lower my defenses. Her friends flirting with my friend. We partied all night with them (aka we paid for all the drinks), and in the end of the night she and her friends bounced with some local guys who showed up at the last second to pick them up. Although in the FSU you are expected to pay for everything when out with girls, and I don’t really mind as more times than not it leads to success, I take full responsibility for being taken for a ride. That said I do have to commend her ability to portray herself in that manner. From an 18 year old girl at that.</p>
<h4>Sex and Passion</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="../31.media.tumblr.com/d25246d1ae5f79be4107ca89b947f308/tumblr_mq1nh04ejL1rllm3zo1_500.jpg" width="395" height="264"></p>
<p>I spent a large portion of my traveling life in Ukraine after being drawn in by these girls’ beauty.  However as hot as they were, sex was often times uneventful. It seemed like more of a progessionary duty than something they enjoyed from deep within. Sure they would get into it, and sex was good with some of the girls, but at best it was just that — “good sex.”</p>
<p>Well, to my pleasant surprise Russian girls were very very different. They absolutely love sex. Every girl I had the fortune of being with was some of the best sex of my life. They are passionate beyond what you can imagine, and I will go so far as to say they exceed Brazilian girl sensuality — once behind closed doors. They will go from being the quietest girl you met on the street or bar, to the girl begging you to pull her hair in several different positions as she screams “Da!” with every thrust, to rubbing your head and giving you slight pecks as she tells you to rest after the great sex you gave her.</p>
<p>Also, it could have just been the luck of the draw for me, but over 90% of them had visually perfect vaginas. Not an errant labia in sight. I may have to supplement one of my previous articles and say that <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8455/how-to-identify-a-roast-beef-vagina">roast beef </a>does not exist in Russia.</p>
<h4>Traditional Values</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="../cdn.sheknows.com/articles/woman-cooking-with-skillet.jpg" width="360" height="239"></p>
<p>We can quickly just comment that they possess all the traditional values real men seek and desire. They can cook, clean, take care of their men, and so on. They show up to a date for a walk in the park with heels and a dress. No different than what you would find in other non-Western societies, but I wanted to throw that out there so we can check off this box.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>There are many countries I have yet to visit, so it’s hard for me to absolutely claim the superiority of Russian girls. But from what I have seen, and what I have experienced, they are the cream of the crop. It’s no wonder if you ask a non-Russian girl what she thinks about Russian girls, you get the standard derogatory statements. If you were a girl that paled in comparison in every way too, you’d also be butthurt.</p>
