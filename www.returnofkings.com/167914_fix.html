<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Have men always been as obsessed with sex as they are today? Was it thrust into their faces practically every single moment? I doubt it. Men of the past had to put so much more energy into survival that sex was seen more as the dessert instead of the main dish like it is now. Otherwise, the sex-obsessed ancient man would surely die of starvation or predation. What you think of as a normal level of horniness and healthy sex attitude would be vulgar and downright ill to men of the past.</p>
<p>I go online and there is sex in places it shouldn’t be. My Twitter timeline is filled with attention-whoring women who showcase their cleavage and beauty, retweeted by thirsty men. The trending list on YouTube is filled with women using their sexuality to get views, and even children’s videos <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/daveyalba/youtube-search-rater-algorithms-children-disturbing-videos?utm_term=.el959npZb#.dwQdz6RlK">have sexual themes</a>. Instagram, an app I barely use, insists on recommending busty women who showcase and jiggle their breasts. The only way you can turn off receiving endless sex messages from the internet is if you don’t go on the internet.</p>

<p>Even when I succeed in not thinking about sex, I’m immediately corrupted as soon as I walk out my door. Women are too eager to show me the curvature of their bodies, their breasts, their ass, and with yoga pants, even the outline of their chubby labia. Women have become so deranged with showing us their sex that many are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topfreedom_in_Canada">petitioning the government to go topless</a> on public streets. It doesn’t matter how much willpower you have as a man, they will attempt to suck you in and put your mind <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/how-the-male-sex-drive-is-being-manipulated">into thinking about fucking them</a> so they feel a sense of validation.</p>

<p>Sex is our generation’s daily obsession. If men don’t spent hours on porn sites or social networking trying to “like” or swipe their way into a woman’s pants, they hop on an airplane and travel thousands of miles away to bang until they’re sick of it. While most of the third world is looking for economic opportunity, the comfortable men of the first world look for sex opportunity, because it’s one of the top things that gives them meaning in life. It’s so easy to survive that so we can safely dedicate ourselves to rock star sex goals at the same time we experiment with a diet or supplement stack <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-decline-in-testosterone-is-destroying-the-basis-of-masculinity">that maximizes our testosterone level</a> to ensure superhuman fornication.</p>
<p>Frankly, I’m tired of it. I’ve dedicated more time than 99% of men into getting sex. It has given me a community of men online I can talk to, which is great, but my soul has nothing to show for it. I don’t want to care about sleeping with a girl I don’t have feelings for. I don’t want to go on another <a href="https://www.rooshvstore.com/travel/">bang mission</a>, or travel to more countries to find a perfect woman who exists only in my mind. Enough! I can’t bear to look at another vagina for the sole purpose of using it as a tool to get a ten-second orgasm that gives me no pleasure <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/junk-food-sex">as soon as it’s done</a>, even though I know deep down that the next girl I sleep with will certainly be someone I do not love.</p>

<p>If some facet of the culture has been normalized by the time you reach puberty, you will think it’s an integral part of humanity. This means that any man born since the sexual revolution of the 1970’s will grow up thinking about sex and pursuing it far more than his ancestors. The situation is worse for men born in the era of internet porn, who don’t know what it’s like not to have hardcore ass-to-mouth videos on demand.</p>
<p>Even if you decide to shake this sex obsession, those around you have not. Girls will insist on displaying vaginas close up to your face, asking if you would kindly take a sniff. Men will insist that you need to “just get laid,” as if that will solve all of your problems. There’s no way to stop it unless you remove yourself totally from society, an unreasonable task. It looks like we’re cursed to have sex a daily part of our existence, whether we like or not.</p>
