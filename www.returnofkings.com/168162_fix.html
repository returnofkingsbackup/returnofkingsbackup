<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Early in the morning yesterday, special agents of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html">FBI raided the office of Trump’s lawyer Michael D. Cohen</a> and seized records which contained confidential material between clientele, just like how it was done in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Stephen Ryan is the lawyer of the lawyer of Donald Trump and commented that this was “completely inappropriate and unnecessary.”</p>
<p>He also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-para-count="386" data-total-count="1000">“Today the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York executed a series of search warrants and seized the privileged communications between my client, Michael Cohen, and his clients,” he continued. “I have been advised by federal prosecutors that the New York action is, in part, a referral by the Office of Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federal prosecutors from Manhattan are now investigating communications between Trump and his lawyer Cohen. They claim payouts were sent to the prostitute Stephanie Clifford aka Stormy Daniels. They have been slamming Cohen with bank fraud allegations and everything else they can dig up, and now again another attempt to revive the old sex allegation.</p>
<p>Hilary Clinton’s illegal scandal where 33,000 emails were lost is not investigated, yet the FBI continues to go after the Trump administration. Due to this noise, the stock market has dropped, effecting the American economy.</p>
<p>Trump himself said the whole thing is like a “witch hunt” with these guys out to get him no matter what the evidence shows. He mentioned that his team have given pages and pages of documentation, but this action is a disgrace and attack on the country. Trump continued that these types of allegations have been going on for a long time, but now it is getting ridiculous.</p>
<p>He also said they found no collusion with Russia whatsoever.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the most biased group of people. These people have the biggest conflicts of interests I’ve ever seen.”</p></blockquote>

<p data-para-count="386" data-total-count="1000">Reporters asked Trump if he had an affair with Daniels after he concluded his comments trying to get an answer, but this claim against him is just another engineered strategy to get him impeached. Why is the deep state continuing this witch hunt over an allegation by some slut? They are making it as though she is some actress or star, but no, she is a prostitute who had sex with God knows how many for money, hence <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/127574/women-are-pathologically-addicted-to-flaunting-their-bodies-for-sexual-attention">prostituting on camera</a>. This case is being dragged out farther than it ever should have.</p>

</div>
<p data-para-count="386" data-total-count="1000">During the 60 Minutes interview, Stormy’s pupils looked dilated as if she had just taken drugs. Her husband helped her pass the polygraph test, yet mainstream media made it sound like she was telling the truth. She and her husband <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/secrets-behind-stormy-daniels-husbands-and-their-involvement-in-her-porn-career.html/?a=viewall">collaborated together</a> on this alleged affair. She also has a history of domestic violence charges and cheating former husbands for money. So, believing the words coming out of this washed up old hag is like treating Hilary Clinton’s words as truth.</p>
<h3>It is time to fire Mueller</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-133966 " src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mueller-300x169.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="262"></p>
<p>Who gave this rogue maniac Mueller the authority to investigate Cohen’s records? Ask any lawyer and they’ll confirm that any communication with a client must be held in strict confidence, and not subject to being ceased by the FBI.</p>
<p>Trump was asked if he’ll fire Mueller after he gave his comments, and he replied that the situation is very sad and went in about how the FBI has fallen in its performance. However, he did not rule out that possibility.</p>
<p>Popular talk show host Michael Savage even <a href="https://twitter.com/ASavageNation/status/983449162971742208">tweeted</a> to get rid of this guy.</p>

<p>He’s nothing but trouble, and now it is time to give him to boot. He’s a danger to Trump and to the stability of the U.S. government with his obsessive-compulsive thirst for trying to find dirt on Trump. Robert Muller needs to go, immediately.</p>
<p>To make matter worse, once again Russia and Assad are being for blamed attacks in The Middle East even though no concrete evidence exists whatsoever. With Bolton by Trump’s side, expect another Syria incident which is going to infuriate the already angry Eastern powers. Watch out for young men losing their lives in unnecessary wars due to desperate greasy old men who are overly aggressive in global affairs.</p>
