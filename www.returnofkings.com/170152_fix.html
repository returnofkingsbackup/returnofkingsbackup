<p>You may not know this, but your skin is the largest organ in your body. Your skin protects your other organs from exposure and is also responsible for contributing to your overall health. As a result, you need to keep it in shape, just like you need to lift weights, do cardio, and eat right in order to keep the other parts of your body in top shape.</p>
<p>Many people these days are aging poorly due to the fact that they don’t take care of their skin. Keeping your skin in shape will make it easier for you to attract women and stay in peak physical condition. Here are three ways you can protect your skin so you age like a fine wine…</p>
<h3>1. Spend less time in the sun</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-170177" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iStock_62292314_MEDIUM.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="364" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iStock_62292314_MEDIUM.jpg 1702w, wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iStock_62292314_MEDIUM-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iStock_62292314_MEDIUM-768x509.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2018/04/iStock_62292314_MEDIUM-100x65.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>The biggest way that people damage their skin is by spending too much time in the sun. According to the World Health Organization, sun damage is responsible for up to 90 percent of visible signs of aging in humans. Effectively, this means that most of what people think is “natural” aging is merely damage caused by sun exposure. While it is important for people to get <em>some </em>sun on a regular basis, doing so without protection is a bad idea and leads to sunburns, wrinkles, and other artifacts of aging.</p>
<p>In general, human beings need at least thirty to sixty minutes of sun exposure per day in order to remain healthy. To strike a balance between sun exposure and aging protection, whenever you leave the house, <a href="https://www.sunsaferx.com/health-and-wellness/how-much-does-sun-age-skin">you should use protection for your skin</a>.</p>
<p>When you leave the house, you should wear a hat and clothing that covers up your body, and if you’re outdoors for an extended period of time, wear sunblock with an SPF rating of at least 50. This will allow you to garner the benefits of sun exposure while minimizing the negative aspects of it.</p>
<h3>2. Reduce your smoking and alcohol consumption</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-170178" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dn25739-1_800.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="421" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dn25739-1_800.jpg 800w, wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dn25739-1_800-300x230.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dn25739-1_800-768x588.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>Tobacco, alcohol, and drugs may be fun to use, but excessive consumption causes skin damage and accelerated aging. According to a study, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/health/smoking-aging-identical-twins/index.html">heavy drinkers were 33 to 35 percent more likely</a> to show visible signs of aging compared to moderate drinkers of teetotalers. Similarly, another study showed that <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/11/171115195303.htm">smoking one pack of cigarettes per day</a> increases your risk of accelerated aging by 41 percent. Individuals who moderated their alcohol/tobacco intake or avoided it entirely <a href="http://time.com/5024284/drinking-smoking-aging/">aged much more slowly</a>.</p>

<p>While there’s nothing wrong with enjoying a cigar every so often or a few drinks when you’re out with friends, binge drinking and heavy smoking are destroying your skin. In order to protect yourself, cut back on your alcohol and tobacco consumption, and consider quitting entirely. Your skin will thank you.</p>
<h3>3. Wash your face daily and use moisturizer</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-170176" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Face_Wash_Front.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="481"></p>
<p>Facial cleansers and moisturizers are generally ignored by men because they are viewed as “girly” or feminine. However, a good quality moisturizer is nothing to be ashamed of, because it can clean your face and preserve your skin at the same time, making you look considerably younger than your age. If you start using a moisturizer today, you’ll be glad ten years down the line when you’ve slowed or halted some of the effects of aging.</p>
<p>Using regular soap on your face is a bad idea because its ingredients are harsh on your skin and cause damage over time. This isn’t a problem when it comes to other parts of your body, but bar soap will cause long-term damage to your face. Consider this: do you <em>really</em> think it’s a good idea to use the same bar of soap you use to wash your butt to wash your face?</p>
<p>Facial cleansers and moisturizers have other benefits as well. Beyond removing dirt on your skin and keeping it clean, facial cleansers can also soften up your facial hair, making shaving much easier and reducing the likelihood of developing ingrown hairs. Moisturizers will also re-hydrate your skin, keeping it from becoming dry while preventing inflammation. This is especially important during the winter due to the risk of developing eczema and other issues due to dry, cold air.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/mpc/A1WW8RURKNRO8W">Daily Face Wash</a> By Wadi Men’s Care is an all-in-one facial cleanser and pre-shave wash that is specifically designed for men.
