<p>As discussed in <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/1484/gaming-in-school-is-not-enough">Gaming In School Is Not Enough</a>, the most important game advice for young guys is to cold approach as many women as possible. In order to do this, school and college-aged guys must expand the pool of girls they approach and start going after slightly older women, making slight adjustments to their game as they do so.</p>
<p>For young men, the norm of dating girls their own age or younger severely reduces the number of available women for them to approach. Since for young guys, “older women” for them are still young and in their prime, it makes sense for them to pursue this demographic</p>
<p>In order to do so, young men will need to have these women think that they are the same age as them or slightly older. Often times, a girl who suspects that you are younger than her will ask how old you are early in the interaction, particularly with night game. The problem with the girl asking this is that it forces you to guess their age. If you think she is 23, and you give 22 as an answer to your age, swooping her will become more difficult when she says she is 24. If you say you are one year younger then it usually won’t be a big deal, but any more than that and it may harm your chances.</p>
<p>With girls you suspect of being older than you, it’s very important that the first personal question in the conversation you ask is “By the way, how old are you?” Do not do this too early into the approach, but make sure she doesn’t ask before you do. When she tells you her age,  say that you are the exact same age or a year older and then note that you look young for your age. If she makes a point of agreeing with you, ramble about how annoying it is getting carded at venues all the time and how people mistake your younger brother for being older than you, but how you won’t be complaining when you’re in your 30’s and 40’s preying on nubile younger women.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>This little routine will be less effective if you take a pause after saying your age and the girl interjects saying you look younger first, so do not give her that chance. The smaller the perceived age gap is between the two of you, the less this is needed. Running this on a girl only a year older than you could backfire, as the gap between what you look like and your claimed age is small enough to be believable without explanation, so providing one unnecessarily will raise a girls suspicions.  On a girl who is three or more years older than you however, it will go a long way to reassuring her that you are as old as you say you are.</p>
<p><em>Warning: There is a limit to how much older you can claim to be. The oldest I have gotten away with is 7 years, and that was with facial hair and being dressed well. Individual variance will play a big role here, your mileage may vary.</em></p>
<p>Past the initial approach, there isn’t much you need to adjust in your game. If you need to number close her, do not try and Facebook close instead because she’ll quickly realize you lied about your age. If she doesn’t want to give you her number but wants your Facebook instead, tell her you’ve deactivated it. If you do have a Facebook, make sure you’ve changed your privacy settings so that only mutual friends can find you via search.</p>
<p>Lastly, on subsequent dates you need to be able to remember and elaborate on the backstory you told the girl when you first met her. The easiest way to handle this is to pretend to be studying or employed in what you plan to do in the future. This makes sure that your personality will be congruent with your backstory.</p>
<p>If young guys approach women older than them, with a few minor adjustments to their game to account for the age gap,  they can massively expand the number of girls in their dating pool and get more sex as a result.</p>
