<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last year I went to China to work. Naturally one of the my biggest concerns before going was whether I would be able to get laid. Would Chinese women, I wondered, be boringly conservative? Would they be labouring under not just seven decades of communist repression but five millennia of tradition constituting what the Chinese call “the oldest civilisation in the world”™?. Perhaps it would be a good thing and, insulated from the degeneracy of the modern West, Chinese women would make for great marriage material? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Since there was a real dearth of information on China in the manosphere to answer my questions, there was only one way of finding out. And find out I did. Here is a list of some things you should know about dating Chinese women in China.</span></p>
<h3><span class="s1">1. The average Chinese woman is attractive </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Straight off the plane I was surprised by how attractive Chinese women were. I’d lived a few years in South America where Latinas provided a satisfying alternative to the average Western European land whale. Chinese girls, however, are on a whole other level. Slim, petite, cute, even, dare I say it, elegant. I can sling around even more epithets, but I’ll just give you some photos of normal girls from around my city (yes I took all of them):</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-172843" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WechatIMG39.jpeg" alt="" width="410" height="465"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-172861" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WechatIMG73.jpeg" alt="" width="441" height="476"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-172844" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_243620180426-193331.jpg" alt="" width="452" height="328"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-172863" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WechatIMG64.jpeg" alt="" width="413" height="447"></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-172845" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WechatIMG33.jpeg" alt="" width="367" height="404"></p>
<p><span class="s1">I stress again these are just normal, not exceptional, girls. A dime a dozen. And there is a biological reason for that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While I can’t endorse the “they all look the same!” stereotype, there is definitely less phenotypic variation amongst the Chinese than you see amongst Caucasians. Basically, there are a few moulds that the vast majority of Chinese women will be a variation of and this puts the majority of 18 to 30 y/o women in the 6 to 9 range. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So while say there are very few 10’s (the breathtaking beauties that you might consider fucking even if they had AIDS), there are very few few 5’s (in my book someone who you wouldn’t fuck even if drunk) and below. Very rarely will you see anything like the bovine monstrosities that lug themselves around western city centres. Relentless social pressure assures that most Chinese women stay in shape even as they get older.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Chinese women are very easy to pick up </span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s get straight to the point. In China, just like in South America and South East Asia, there is 100% a foreigner pass that no matter how you look (as long as you are white) gets you a front row seat on the fish taco express (however this is a VERY qualified pass – see no. 6).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The mechanics of dating in China are also easy. China is a far more technologically integrated society than the western world (mobile phones are used for absolutely everything) and there are a huge variety of apps through which you can easily procure a “one night stand” which has become a popular term in the Chinese culture. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There is also, surprisingly, far less BS involved with asking a girl out. You can just send a message along the lines of “want to go out sometime” or even just walk up to someone somewhere in the supermarket or on the subway and you will be given a very matter of fact yes or no (this goes for Chinese guys too – and the answer is usually yes). Girls will definitely not treat you like a sex pest.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Chinese men are hopeless</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_172838" style="width: 396px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-172838" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WechatIMG38.jpeg" alt="" width="386" height="515"><p class="wp-caption-text">Milk tea and cat videos. The Chinese manosphere.</p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your foreigner pass will be gilt-edged by the poor quality of the domestic competition. Chinese men are the least manly group of people I have ever come across. Physically they are slightly built and on the short side but more damning is their social behaviour. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I first got to China I was amazed by the open displays of homosexuality. I soon found out that the young men I saw walking around arm in arm were actually most likely friends and it’s normal to embrace like a bunch of gay lovers. It is also a very common sight to see groups of young men hanging out in “bars” where they will sit for hours playing video games drinking overpriced bubble tea or green tea topped with powdered milk. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There may be concerns in the West about fielding future battalions of limp wristed snowflakes and transgenders, but from what I see, if they do battle with the Chinese, they might well have the edge against man-boys whose endocrine and nervous systems have been devastated by a daily barrage of soy protein and funny cat videos.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Chinese girls are not sexually experienced</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Having a limpid male population coupled with pornography ostensibly being banned in China has resulted in very undeveloped sexual skills. I don’t mean that girls will be virgins, but, whereas one of the few silver linings of western decline is that at least your average Tinder date is near guaranteed to give a pornstar blowjob, your average Chinese girl will barely get her mouth around the tip before before she becomes a tremulous jumble of adrenaline and uncertainty. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This may be seen as a negative but the chance to school them on how to fuck properly is a definite positive. It will earn you an eternal place in their heart.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">5. Chinese girls have a different smell</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s get into some negatives. Perhaps not a major one, but with Chinese girls you definitely come across some funky smells. If I could give it a general description, I would say they smell of Chinese food. Probably won’t be up to everyone’s tastes, but for someone like me who grew up in the UK, it’s a welcome change from dick and alcopop breath.</span></p>

Too bad he came from a loser civilisation”</p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The most important point in this article. If you have lived in somewhere like South America or SE Asia you will probably be used to the girls itching to turn that foreigner pass into a long term relationship/ marriage and their own passport to the West. Not so in China. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chinese women will be quite happy to bang you but they are NOT desperate. Maybe it was different in the past but nowadays the Chinese are quite aware of their position in the world. “China No.1!” is a common refrain you hear in not so jokey conversation and if they see a foreigner in their midst they are more likely assume you as a loser who couldn’t succeed in your own decrepit civilisation rather than the bearer of great cultural and economic riches. A common phrase in China for a foreigner is ‘LBH’: loser back home. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Have you noticed even amongst Chinese emigres in the U.S and Europe there is a strong tendency to marry within their own community? Fact is, despite being unmasculine, Chinese men are professional, hard working, and wealthy. Chinese women being a few IQ points above Western women will not put having great sex above the ultimate goal of having a family and economic stability which they are more likely to do with Chinese men.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">7. You will have to deal with ‘face’</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All of Chinese social life turns on the concept of ‘face’ or Miàn zi (面子) which basically means keeping up appearances and avoiding humiliation. If you are just having flings this probably won’t be an issue (because she is unlikely to tell anyone about your relationship). However, if you are long term, then you will have to adhere to the social code, meaning you must spend big to impress her family and peers. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You must also get ready to seriously up the spending in a year or so because if you have made it to long term status that means that marriage is on the cards. A Chinese girl cannot be seen to have had various unsuccessful relationships and she must have a house and family by around 28 otherwise she will be considered a ‘leftover woman’ that no self respecting Chinese man would marry. She will then be forced to try her luck with a foreigner on an online dating site (the humiliation!). </span></p>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">8. Don’t marry a Chinese woman unless you are a millionaire or she is prepared to leave China</span></h3>
<div id="attachment_139309" style="width: 526px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-139309" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/11/house.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="345" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/11/house.jpg 1600w, wp-content/uploads/2017/11/house-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2017/11/house-768x512.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2017/11/house-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px"><p class="wp-caption-text">The second house you buy could be yours!</p>
</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because of ‘face,’ in order to marry their daughter you will be expected to pay the parents of your girlfriend a dowry. When I say dowry, don’t think jewelry or some gold bullion coins. Think a house or sports car. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After that you will be expected to lay on a lavish ceremony followed by an expensive holiday accompanied by ridiculous wedding photos. So make sure you are loaded especially in the South of China. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you do however manage to clear these hurdles then congratulations. You are likely to have married a smart family-orientated woman. However there is still the issue of having to live in China. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a foreigner your business won’t truly be yours and any assets like a house and land you ‘own’ will only be enjoyed on a leasehold basis. </span><span class="s1">Also, If you have a child in China you’re going to have to accept that it’s a subject of the Chinese state. Chinese nationality law is one of the most draconian in the world, so make sure never to piss off your wife or face never seeing your kids again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ideally you should convince your wife to move. If you stay, be prepared to keep a low profile and live in a cage, albeit a very gilded one where you can certainly enjoy the trappings of luxury. You can also access ROK without any problem, which is more than can be said for my mobile provider in the UK.</span></p>
<h4 class="p1"><span class="s1">Conclusion </span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chinese women are surprisingly attractive. If you enjoy banging exotic chicks then it is absolutely possible in China. Having long term relationships with a Chinese woman is a whole different ball game. You will face unrelenting pressure to keep up appearances and spend big money. If you are able to do so then it may be worth it. Chinese women are intelligent, family orientated and feminine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My advice however is to go there, soak up the culture, and treat any relationship like a Sino-American joint venture; pump, dump and get the hell out the dodge.</span></p>
