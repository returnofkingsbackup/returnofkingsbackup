<p>If there’s anything the modern age has taught us, it’s that there isn’t a problem that can’t be tackled by reality television.  According a new casting notice, there is a TV show aiming to provide expert help to men who are leading a double life with two families.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of men living a life with <a href="http://listverse.com/2017/10/21/10-unbelievable-stories-of-married-people-with-secret-families/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">a secret, “second family” is nothing new</a>. From King Edward IV and Charles Lindbergh to Charles Kuralt, some of history’s most prominent men allegedly managed to keep a significant other AND kids secret from their wives. Charles Kuralt supposedly did it for nearly 30 years!</p>
<h4><strong>Yes, it’s still a thing</strong></h4>

<p>“But that was 50 or even hundreds of years ago,” you’re saying. People could actually get away with that sort of thing before cell phones, video cameras, and the internet, right?  Well, just because our lives are more public now, it doesn’t mean <a href="https://www.salon.com/2011/04/12/secret_family/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">that it doesn’t happen</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Daily Mail, a woman in South Carolina recently discovered her husband <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2726424/Woman-discovers-husband-married-four-different-women-four-different-states-finding-photos-FACEBOOK-authorities-think-more.html?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">was married to three other women</a>. And there have been several other documented cases in both the US and the UK over the past 10 years.</p>
<h4><strong>It can be more complicated than you think</strong></h4>

<p>In her book “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/books/review/dont-tell.html?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Anatomy of a Secret Life: The Psychology of Living a Lie</a>,” Gail Saltz writes, “When our secrets start to control us — and far too often they do — then a normal life clicks over into something else: a secret life.”</p>
<p>And those secret lives — whether it’s cheating on a spouse, stealing, or assuming another identity — are fueled by self-deception, which, she says, can be “destructive to ourselves and to others.” In extreme cases, they can have devastating consequences – emotional and otherwise — for everyone involved.</p>
<h4><strong>Between a rock and a hard place</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-173910" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/05/bigamist4.jpg" alt="" width="568" height="362"></p>
<p>So, what is the right thing to do? Coming clean to both families would feel like an impossible position. How would you approach it? How would you tell them? How are they going to react? It couldn’t be easy for anybody involved.</p>
<p>Chances are the man doesn’t even have someone to confide in. He’s probably alone with his secrets — secrets that will certainly be discovered.  He will miss a flight, confuse a text or forget to delete an email. At some point, his carefully maintained house of cards will collapse.</p>
<p>To avoid a potentially chaotic and destructive process, maybe seeking expert help does make sense. With the right guidance for everyone involved, someone – yes, even on a TV show — MIGHT have a chance of acknowledging the truth in a reasonably healthy way.</p>
<h4><strong>Will the truth set you free?</strong></h4>
<p>Honestly, we don’t know the right answer, but the experts on TV always seem to.
