<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>I was a country music fan in the 90’s. I would sit in my dad’s truck and listen to the local country station non-stop. There was an occasion that the truck battery died because I had spent all day listening to the radio. My parents had always been of the mind that secular music was of the devil, so I couldn’t listen to country tunes inside the house. While they were wrong at the time, the music I hear now is of the devil.</p>
<p>When I actually pay attention to the lyrics of the music I listen to, I am appalled at their acute beta anthems. Music to me is a commodity. I don’t take any artist or song seriously; if my ear likes a certain song then I will leave it on for the duration of the ride. If the song is extra catchy, I will sing along to it. Unfortunately, things are no longer that simple.</p>
<p>Some of the country songs that are coming out are full of absolute beta-male doctrine. I couldn’t bring myself to listen to them, much less sing along to them. What I have rather done is to hate-listen to these songs while I wonder if there is anyone on earth that actually agrees with the themes in the music.</p>
<p>Therefore, I bring you 5 current country songs that reek of disgusting lyrics. All of these songs are beta-anthems.</p>
<h3>1. Jordan Davis – Singles You Up</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/0hjqGN-9anA.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This song by Jordan Davis is likely the weakest song I’ve heard in a very long time.  The melody is fun and energetic, but the lyrics are beyond reprehensible. Let us examine just the chorus:</p>
<blockquote><p>If he ever singles you up, if he’s ever stupid enough<br>
I’ma be the first one calling you baby (baby)<br>
If he ain’t holding you tight, if he ain’t treating you right<br>
I’ma be the first one calling him crazy (crazy)<br>
‘Cause girl, it’s just a matter of time until you find<br>
That the right guy’s staring you back into your eyes, right now<br>
No rush, but if he ever singles you up</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me while I wretch. Not only is the guy in the song freefalling in a self-made abyss, he’s willing to wait for another man to get tired of poking a girl so that he can swoop in and “save” her. Little does he know, that this hypothetical woman would still reject him while laying with the next alpha.</p>
<h3>2. Keith Urban – Female</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/V8BhbOqgTAI.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>I am certain that Keith Urban has no real friends, because a true friend would not allow his brother to write such a song and would scold him harshly for actually performing it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it Just ’cause she was wearin’ a skirt<br>
Oh, is that how that works?<br>
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first. Does that make Eve second best<br>
Or did He save the best for last?</p>

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Keith then goes on to list a slew of words including technicolor and I’m not sure how it fits. The song was obviously written for Keith to remain relevant and radio stations ignore how stupid it is.</p>
<h3>3. Thomas Rhett – Marry Me</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/p_IwENcMPOA.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Here we have yet another beta pining after a woman who doesn’t feel the same way. The difference here is that the girl is planning to get married to someone else—he’s invited. In the song, Thomas states how they been friends for a long time and he almost got to kiss her once, but he wussed out.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll wear my black suit, black tie, hide out in the back<br>
I’ll do a strong shot of whiskey straight out the flask<br>
I’ll try to make it through without crying so nobody sees<br>
Yes, she wanna get married<br>
But she don’t wanna marry me</p></blockquote>
<p>This is absolute filth. Could you ever put yourself in the situation where you’re attending the wedding of a girl you secretly love? He could just stay home but a beta loves to suffer for the girls he can’t have. Horrible message.</p>
<h4>4. Luke Bryan – Most People Are Good</h4>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/e6EGQFJLl04.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The greatest lie of the left is that people are naturally good and if we were to just give each other, we alone could make the world a better place.  That is why they put great emphasis on bigger government—it is the only way they can control those deemed ‘out of control’.  Enter Luke Bryan with a soft-toned song about the greatness of people.  He panders to some leftist ideas in his song:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe most people are good<br>
And most Mama’s oughta qualify for sainthood<br>
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights<br>
I believe you love who you love<br>
Ain’t nothing you should ever be ashamed of<br>
I believe this world ain’t half as bad as it looks<br>
I believe most people are good</p></blockquote>
<p>Most mothers should not qualify for any type of sainthood because they are the reason why we are plagued with weak men in the USA.  Good people have a set moral compass, typically found in their religion.  Without it, their morals are malleable to their interests.  Morality is not fluid.  Not only is this song a beta-anthem, it’s an Open Borders anthem, too.  Culture matters, Luke.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Country music used to be the songs of hardworking men who enjoyed the occasional binge drinking.  Now it has been invaded by beta anthems that perpetuate oneitis and a Disneyesque view of the world.  These songs are good for a laugh.  Unfortunately, some take music as gospel and adhere to the messages found in them.  Brainwashing can come with a melody.</p>
