<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Sweden SJWs continues their never ending quest to destroy all the remains left of a once prosperous, nationalistic, traditionalist and virtuous society. This time Sweden’s SJWs newest target is our beloved <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/24/church-of-sweden-to-stop-referring-to-god-as-he-or-lord">Lord Jesus Christ and his gender</a>. Yes, you heard that right. The Church of Sweden dares to attempt a change in God’s gender.They had the audacity to change the word of God and Jesus in an attempt to push their Marxist degenerate political agenda even further.</p>
<h4><b>How did the Church of Sweden lose all of its integrity?</b></h4>
<p>As you all know, the causes for the downfall of Swedish Society, a once exemplary and successful Nordic country, can be <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/123194/what-the-hell-is-wrong-with-sweden">blamed for a series of events</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/68413/sweden-continues-to-fund-bizarre-and-inappropriate-sex-education-for-young-children">bad political decisions</a> and their<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/30748/the-curious-case-of-the-feminist-party-in-sweden"> infamous Feminist Party</a>. But when talking about the current degeneracy contaminating Sweden Evangelical Lutheran Church we can trace this issue back into one single event. Which is the appointment of Antje Jackelén to assume the role of Archbishop. She is Sweden’s first female to become an Archbishop.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-66673" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Rainbow_Flag_Church.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="302"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of Ms. Jackelen using her power and influence to bring back family values and traditionalism to a country that is quickly losing its national identity, she is being used as a puppet by Swedish political SJWs to bring their cultural Marxist madness into the house of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Church of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/24/church-of-sweden-to-stop-referring-to-god-as-he-or-lord">Sweden</a> is urging its clergy to use gender-neutral language when referring to the supreme deity, refraining from using terms such as “Lord” and “he” in favour of the less specific “God.”</p>
<p>The move is one of several taken by the national Evangelical Lutheran church in updating a 31-year-old handbook setting out how services should be conducted in terms of language, liturgy, hymns and other aspects.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><b>How is Jackelen and her crew bringing Swedish SJWs’s political agenda to the church?</b></h4>

</div>
<p>Since her appointment as Archbishop, Jackelén and her crew have been slowly pushing Sweden’s infamous gender neutral agenda to their national Evangelical Lutheran Church by urging its clergy to omit the fact that Jesus/God is a man during their sermons. When confronted by journalists about her decision to promote the omission of God’s gender, she denies it by claiming “its all fake news”. She claims that rather than “banning” masculine pronouns for Jesus they are just advising the clergy to “avoid” using them.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, she is part of a group that in 2009 allowed the <a href="https://www.qx.se/english/12396/lesbian-bishop-consecrated-in-sweden/">first openly gay female Bishop</a> and pushed for <a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/lesbian-bishop-wants-to-remove-church-crosses-so-muslims-wont-be-offended/66831.htm">banning the use of crosses</a>. The latter was deemed “too offensive” for incoming Muslim refugees. Her band of “progressivists” also pushed for <a href="https://www.christiantoday.com/article/lesbian-bishop-wants-to-remove-church-crosses-so-muslims-wont-be-offended/66831.htm">Lutheran Churches to set up Muslim prayer rooms</a> for arriving immigrants.</p>
<p>I wonder if Ms. Jackelen can sleep at night knowing that she is twisting the holy message of the Bible. She is the false prophet whose main goal is to spread wickedness to the last refugee of good souls in Sweden. In other words, she is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p>

<blockquote><p>“And the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day; And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,  And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:  Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:” – <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+18%3A1-4&amp;version=KJV">Genesis 18:1-4</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>As explicitly proved by the Bible,  Sweden’s Evangelical Lutheran Church is committing a serious doctrinal error by submitting into this crazy gender neutral idea.  The Holy Bible leaves no room for speculation about God’s gender and makes it perfectly clear, as shown above, that the Lord is a man. Further irrefutable proof of God being a men can be found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14:15-17&amp;version=KJV">John 4:16-17 </a>, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+15%3A26&amp;version=KJV">John 15:26</a> and <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A7&amp;version=KJV">John 16:7</a>. In all those occurrences, The Holy Trinity is literally identified as male!</p>
<h4><b>They are cursing themselves with Apostasy</b></h4>

<blockquote><p>“I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;  Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine.  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;  And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.” – <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy+4&amp;version=KJV">2 Timothy 4:1-4</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>We were warned about a time when the church would no longer strictly follow the word and wisdom of God. Their greediness for power, through a political Marxist agenda, corrupted their hearts and souls. No real Christian in Sweden shall follow their teachings, since their message is rigged with ulterior motives.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-159041" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/02/FiresOfHell.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="271"></p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Revelation 22:18 </b>For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:</p>
<p><b>Revelation 22:19 </b>And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God made it perfectly clear, that if anyone had the audacity of profaning his wisdom by adding, twisting, or removing his sayings, not only he would make sure to remove them from the book of life, but he would also make sure to curse them forever. Ms. Jackelen and her band of progressives are playing with fire here, risking themselves and their so called “Church” to be cursed forever. Real Christians wont fall for this wickedness disguised as Christianity.</p>
<h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-128622" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jesusvssatan.jpg" alt="" width="409" height="276"></p>
<p>Whether you are a Christian or not, trying to change ancient religious texts dating back to 2000 years ago just to fit into your authoritative political narrative is not only disrespectful, but also childish and the uttermost sign of sacrilege, especially when you are trying to modify them for the main purpose of making the almighty Jesus Christ “gender neutral” to appease SJWs. For an Archbishop, Ms. Jackelén has already proved her incompetence for the role. She lacks any respect or real understanding about Christianity.</p>
<p>The real reason she got hired was to be used as a human Trojan horse by the Swedish SJW-like government to spread their gender neutral cancer to the image of the Lord. No respectable archbishop would dare to twist the word of God for a stupid Marxist agenda. May the Lord guide the sane and faithful Christians  and what remains of the clergy in Sweden to not allow this madness and sacrilege, against Christianity, to continue in their society.</p>
