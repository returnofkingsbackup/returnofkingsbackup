<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Baby boomers like to bash them for not “being man enough” to get married and have kids, but common sense will reveal that the “perks” and “benefits” of marriage in America have become less and less lucrative to the average hardworking man. Due to this, many men have stopped pursuing American women altogether. Here’s why:</p>
<h3>1. False Rape Charges</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62915" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Advice_matrress1-e1430774013208.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="651"></p>
<p>Men aren’t stupid; they see what’s going on and are scared of being put behind bars over a silly allegation without evidence. Although they may not talk about it, men do not want to take a chance that jeopardizes their reputation, family, and not to mention hard-earned finances.</p>
<h3>2. Low Quality Of Women</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-178288" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fat-woman.jpg" alt="" width="306" height="576"></p>
<p>Take a good look around the states and you’ll soon go myopic as the hideous sight will cut your testosterone down to soy boy levels. You may not have sexual desire for a while due to the ugliness as it only encourages you to live like a celibate hermit.</p>
<h3>3. They Won’t Ever Be Satisfied</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1646" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/This-American-Whore-Flag.jpeg" alt="" width="550" height="337" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2012/12/This-American-Whore-Flag.jpeg 550w, wp-content/uploads/2012/12/This-American-Whore-Flag-300x183.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>It is impossible to satisfy an American woman, period. They are so spoiled and brainwashed by Disney and other media outlets that no man can please them. Even if you give them the world, they will seek the stars, so men have given up as it’s too much of a burden financially, emotionally, and physically.</p>
<h3>4. They’re On Drugs</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-62351" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/drugs1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="311" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/drugs1.jpg 550w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/drugs1-300x170.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/drugs1-262x148.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>It amazes me how many girls in their early twenties are taking some over the counter medication for acne, depression, or what have you. In the past, previous girls I had slight interest in would reveal problems like Crohn’s disease, mental instability, hives, and weird things like they can’t eat kale and alike. I tried to get serious with one even after admitting her serious problem, but that insecurity kept ruining everything and I had to stop seeing her.</p>
<p>And it is hardly ever just one problem. Usually, they have a physical ailment or two which leads them to have mental problems. American women are just a wreck.</p>

</div>
<h3>5. They’re Too Career-Minded</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-21756" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/11/rsz_1o-cosmo-careers-sheryl-sandberg-facebook-1.jpg" alt="" width="531" height="368"></p>
<p>Too many are focused on competing and achieving financial success, and while that is fine, they take it to the extreme. By the time they reach their career goals, they’re no longer attractive. The stress takes a toll on their bodies, and it clearly shows early on, even as soon as twenty-three.</p>
<p>More college girls I see look much older, some looking in their thirties. I remember seeing one girl on the show Kitchen Nightmares who was twenty-five, but she looked like she was freaking fifty. The business career-oriented woman is just not attractive, and professional women are among the unhappiest.</p>
<h3>6. Horrible Personalities</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-7898" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/03/bitchy.jpg" alt="" width="339" height="323"></p>
<p>They play mind games, are control freaks, crave attention, have poor motherly qualities, and won’t cook.</p>
<h3>7. Just All-Around Bad Vibes</h3>
<p>Ever go to a place and just get an off feeling? Well, try this, go outside of America and explore the women and you’ll soon realize that dealing with foreign women is a more pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Once you come back and start dealing with American women again, something changes—you just don’t care anymore. The slutty faces, the entitlement, the demanding nature; it’s all just unattractive, and men instinctively are turned off because deep down their biological mechanisms are signaling that these women are not worthy of bearing their children.</p>
<h4>Does this mean the end of fornication?</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-92871" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Temple-Marriage.jpg" alt="" width="502" height="384"></p>
<p>Far from it, instead men will become more selective of whom they spend their time and share intimacy with. As for American women, well, the common theme I’ve seen, whether it’s Muslim, Asian, or Caucasian men, is to simply use them for fun, and throw them out when finished.</p>
<p>I’ve known men of various races express this perspective to me either directly or indirectly as a joke. One Muslim guy told me flat out that the whites (gora) are only good for one thing, and it isn’t long-term commitment. He got a lot of girls, but later I found out that he married a young pretty Muslim girl, and the rest as they say is history.</p>
<p>For every action, there is a reaction. American women have become degenerates, and in response to that American men no longer want them anymore and instead have set their sights on better quality foreign women.</p>
