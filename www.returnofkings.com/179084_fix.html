<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Compared to just 30 years ago, so much of what we expected from men and women has reversed. Men used to be the ones spending extra hours at work trying to climb the corporate ladder. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/174224/5-ways-women-make-themselves-masculine">Now women do that</a>. Women used to dedicate their time to pursuing a good mate. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/174232/5-ways-men-make-themselves-feminine">Now men do that</a>. Male high school teachers used to be the ones arrested for having sex with their female students. Now there is a new headline every few weeks about a female teacher arrested for having sex with her male students.</p>
<p>I remember when I was in high school and one of the male English teachers was about to go on trial for having an affair with a 15-year-old girl. Just two days after the story spread through the school, that teacher killed himself before facing a trial. I still remember my own English teacher discussing the situation with us.</p>
<p>But those days are gone. It’s women who are having affairs with their students, and some of these women are surprisingly attractive.</p>
<h3>Stephanie Peterson</h3>
<p>This 26-year-old middle school science teacher was arrested for sending nude pics to a 14-year-old student, having sex with him in her car and in a barn, and bringing him marijuana. She was arrested just two weeks after she filed for divorce from her husband, a firefighter. Her bond was $12,500.</p>

<h4>Beware of Teachers</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/61710/6-reasons-why-you-shouldnt-date-teachers">Here is a great article recommending you avoid dating teachers.</a> Teenagers are almost universally horrible, annoying people. When women choose to be high school teachers, there is some deeper psychology behind their decision. They are to be avoided, both for our own sakes and for our sons’.</p>
