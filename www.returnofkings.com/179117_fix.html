<p>Most men tend to follow a very basic skincare routine of grabbing a bar of soap, taking a shower, and heading out the door. If you’re one of them, then we’ve got some bad news for you: this careless routine is taking a serious toll on your skin.</p>
<p>Sure, you can’t see it right now because you are young and ready to take on the world and all that jazz, but that doesn’t mean that the negligence isn’t building up! After years of doing this, suddenly you are 50 and those crow’s feet around your eyes are looking seriously messed-up.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, to save you from a nightmarish future like this, here are 7 easy skin care tips. Prepare to stand out from the crowd and grab every woman’s attention!</p>
<h3>1. Cleanse</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-179126" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/man-wash-face.jpg" alt="" width="548" height="439"></p>
<p>Cleansing is the first step to achieving good skin. Using the same bar of soap or body scrub that you use in the shower won’t cut the deal. The facial skin is different from the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Cleansing at least once daily is a must. If you have oily skin, you need to do it twice or even thrice. People with oily skin often wake up with grimy and oily face, so it’s necessary to start off with a cleanser.</p>
<p>If you have dry or combination skin, you can skip the cleanser in the morning and only wash off with water instead. But adding a cleanser to your nightly routine is a must for all types of skin.</p>
<p>Our skin battles with grime and pollution all day long. The buildup of dirt clogs the pores, which then leads to other skin related problems such as acne, blackheads, whiteheads etc. All of these can be prevented by using a cleanser as soon as you retire for the day.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the skin might get dry due to not using the right cleanser. You’ll know the cleanser isn’t right when the face feels too dry or uncomfortable. To avoid this from happening, you can use a gentle cleanser such as the COUI Nourishing Facial Cleansing Oil.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.couiskincare.com/products/nourishing-facial-cleansing-oil?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">COUI Nourishing Facial Cleansing Oil</a> is made of ingredients which will remove the dirt without stripping it off of its natural oils. It’s also alcohol and harsh chemicals free, making it a perfect cleanser to keep the skin hydrated and moisturized.</p>
<h3>2. Moisturize</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-179130" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lotion-hand.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="406"></p>
<p>This is an absolutely mandatory step and must be added to your daily routine, especially after shaving. Shaving can leave the skin itchy and dry, and putting on a moisturizer can help retain the skin’s hydration.</p>
<p>Dry skin can lead to premature signs of aging. To prevent that, it’s essential to use a moisturizer. A moisturizer can help the skin stay hydrated. Dehydration is one of the major causes of aging lines and wrinkles.</p>
<p>It becomes even more necessary if you have dry or combination skin. But oily skin also needs a moisturizer to keep the skin from producing excess sebum to compensate for the dryness. Everyone needs a moisturizer to keep the skin looking young and healthy.</p>
<p>One of the best moisturizers on the market is the <a href="https://www.couiskincare.com/products/phytemanteau-day-cream?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">COUI Phytemanteau Day Cream</a>. It gives the proper hydration to keep the skin natural looking and healthy while providing the needed protection to keep the skin from aging. The cream contains powerful antioxidants to prevent the skin from UV rays and pollutants in the daytime.</p>
<p>You will feel your skin’s suppleness once you start using a moisturizer. Skipping the moisturizer is a grave mistake for any men looking to stay younger looking for a long time. <a href="https://www.couiskincare.com/collections/all?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">COUI skincare</a> serves 100% lifetime satisfaction guarantee to make sure you get the best looking skin for years to come.</p>
<p>You can use a different cream for the night. For skin to look young and healthy, it’s a good practice to add products with Retinol in your skincare regime. Such a good night cream is the COUI Retinol Night Cream.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.couiskincare.com/products/retinol-night-cream?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">COUI Retinol Night Cream</a> is suitable for all skin types. It adds years to your skin while you sleep, thanks to its active anti-aging ingredients. If you are in your late twenties or up, it’s a great time to add this to your night routine.</p>
<h3>3. Add a Serum</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-179122" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/toner-906142_1920.jpg" alt="" width="538" height="400"></p>
<p>Serums are great skincare products for anyone looking to target specific skin issues they are dealing with. Men tend to go out without using sun protection, so they are more prone to getting skin conditions such as acne, scars from acne, blackheads, whiteheads, enlarged pores, hyperpigmentation, sun damage etc. And let’s be real, nobody wants to look like a scrawny teenager in the height of puberty, especially women.</p>
<p>The answer to these problems can be serums targeted to the specific issues. Serums are made to easily penetrate the skin and solve the issues accordingly.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.couiskincare.com/products/super-c-serum?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">COUI Super C Serum</a> is such a serum that targets a lot of the skin issues mentioned here. It’s called Super C because of its extraordinary line of ingredients. It’s a breakthrough when it comes to anti-aging.</p>
<p>The main ingredient that makes the product stand out from other C serums is the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF). EGF helps in stimulating the production of collagen, something that becomes necessary while your skin starts to age.</p>
<p>Adding the COUI Super C Serum on your skin care routine will make sure that you have healthy and glowing looking skin. It helps the skin look supple and radiant. It will definitely help you stand out and make women notice because most men are neglecting this step.</p>
<h3>4. Shave Right</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-179123" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/person-602971_1920.jpg" alt="" width="549" height="351"></p>
<p>Translating to, “Don’t shave against the hair growth!” Most shave against the direction of the hair growth as this gives a smoother shave. But in reality, you are nicking the buried portion of the hair follicle, which can lead to inflammation.</p>
<p>Instead, always shave on the direction of your hair growth. Also, don’t go over and over the same area, as it can strip off the upper layer of the skin, leading to inflammation and overexposure. Just do one stroke on each section of the face to avoid this.</p>
<p>And while shaving, lather up with water. Shaving dry can increase the chances of getting cuts, acne, and ingrown hair. Make sure you use water to lather up completely before using the razor.</p>
<p>It also makes it easier to shave, as the hair and the skin get softer. Let the shaving gel or cream sit on your skin once you have lathered it up, and then shave. Your skin will thank you.</p>
<h3>5. Read the Label</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-179129" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/health-label-food.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="335"></p>
<p>It’s important to take a good look at the ingredients list of the products you are using. Men, in general, tend to have oilier skin than women, due to testosterone. This hormone can stimulate excess sebum production in the hair follicles.</p>
<p>If you are getting breakouts, read the labels of your products, even the shaving ones. Only buy products which contain the words ‘Oil-free’ or ‘Non-comedogenic’. These terms mean that they will not clog your pores, which in turn will prevent blackheads, whiteheads, and acne.</p>
<h3>6. Avoid Wrinkles around the Eyes</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-179121" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/face-984031_1920.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="398"></p>
<p>Other than using the anti-aging products, it’s also important to use products that can provide overall wrinkle-free skin. An eye cream is thus important as crow’s feet in the eye area can make one look old and exhausted.</p>
<p>The eye area is more delicate compared to the rest of the facial skin. Eye creams tend to mainly cover the dehydration issue. Dehydration equals to the early signs of aging, so an eye cream can come in handy to prevent that.</p>
<p>A good eye cream should address all eye concerns such as puffiness, dark circles, and wrinkles. The <a href="https://www.couiskincare.com/products/luscious-eye-cream?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">COUI Luscious Eye Cream</a> does all of that. It’s made from all the star ingredients to provide the best results.</p>
<p>For example, the caffeine reduces the puffiness, EGF stimulates collagen production and the Chrysin works on dark circles.</p>
<p>A good eye cream can make you look younger for a long time. It’s essential for men to make women notice their youthfulness!</p>
<h3>7. Apply Sunscreen</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-90335" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/07/beach-body-ready.jpg" alt="beach body ready" width="544" height="293"></p>
<p>There is no point in doing any of the mentioned steps if you neglect to follow this one. It is absolutely essential that you use a sunscreen every single day. Sun damage can make you look older than your age. And not to mention, the harmful UV rays can cause skin cancer.</p>
<p>A good sunscreen is the <a href="https://www.couiskincare.com/products/sunscreen-lotion-spf-30?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">COUI Moisturizing SPF 30 Facial Sunscreen Lotion</a>. The lotion is made with natural ingredients to prevent sun damage. Don’t forget to apply it on the neck area as well to prevent signs of aging to appear.</p>
