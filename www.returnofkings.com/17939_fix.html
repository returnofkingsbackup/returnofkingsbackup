<p>If there is one defining feature that separates men and women it can be summed up in one word… loyalty. Why? Because women have none. And is it a bad thing? No, because men are able to excel while women constantly implode their own lives. It’s the reason why men literally run the world, and women hold secretary positions at best. And thank god for it, because if women had any sense of loyalty, there is no doubt in my mind that the red pill would be the biggest failure since new Coke.</p>
<p>Angry women will constantly preach to you about how “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.” What women don’t realize is how moronic they look when bro-code trumps their antics to make them look stupid, all while two men have a laugh over the fact that they both just banged the same chick. See <em>Exhibit A</em> which can be found below.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/_FR5nlkecCU.html" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Personally I haven’t decided what’s more hilarious—the fact that the two guys planned the whole thing and seem to be having a bro moment over busting this chick, or the fact that she was not just publicly shamed, but virally shamed; the video currently has over 2 million views on YouTube alone, plus however many it’s achieved via Facebook.</p>
<p>Which leads us to point number two… everything is your fault. This can be explained with <em>Exhibit B</em>, also seen below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/?attachment_id=17947" rel="attachment wp-att-17947"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-17947" alt="women cheat" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/women-cheat.jpg" width="438" height="291"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, it’s simply your fault for you cheating, and your own fault for her cheating. Of course in the views of feminist America, it couldn’t possibly have anything to do with the fact that she has gained 20 pounds since the beginning of your relationship, or the fact that you hate hanging out with her because all she does is nag. It’s always your fault.</p>

</div>
<p>And here’s <em>Exhibit C:</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/?attachment_id=17945" rel="attachment wp-att-17945"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-17945" alt="dont-try-to-understand-women" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dont-try-to-understand-women.jpg" width="432" height="338"></a></p>
<p>Women hate women. I don’t know what causes their cattiness, but whatever it is, we need to make more of it. It’s hands-down the best thing that has happened to men. With us, there comes a sense of loyalty, most prominently displayed as bro-code. We generally don’t give two shits if you had sex with an ex-girlfriend, or even current possible prospect, so long as the proper protocol is followed.</p>
<p>Women on the other hand have no such system, and the lack of it causes women to constantly get in arguments with each other and be their own worst enemies. The phrase “keep your friends close and your enemies closer” was not coined by a man—it was defined by a woman, because it helped her cope with the fact that she has no real friends, only acquaintances whom she will compete with men over.</p>
<p>Guys, on the other hand, realize there’s no real shortage of pussy, and loyalty to other men benefits them over the long run. This completes the great circle of masculine greatness that keeps men on top, literally, and women on the bottom, until we tell them to ride us or moan into a pillow.</p>
<p>Swallowing the red pill makes you part of a fraternity. Manhood itself was once part of this great fraternity, but feminism has caused many men to become white knights and manginas (Darwinism at work). The men who remain never forget loyalty, because in the end it is the defining feature that helps you get laid while women foil each other’s lives. In essence, loyalty is the key factor to game, and life as a man.</p>
