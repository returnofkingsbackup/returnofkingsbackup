<blockquote>
<p>Daryush Valizadeh is at it again.</p>
<p>More commonly known as “Roosh V,” the controversial pickup artist-turned alt-right figure gained media notoriety in 2016 when he attempted to host a series of worldwide meetups to promote “neomasculinity.” Last week, Valizadeh announced he will be hosting a happy hour in Washington, DC, on Saturday.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>In recent years, Valizadeh has expanded his sphere of interest: Not only are feminism and “female entitlement” threats to western civilization, but so are leftists, Muslim immigrants to the United States, more traditional conservatives, and, of course, Jews.</p>
<p>Valizadeh wrote an antisemitic blog post in June 2017 titled “You Become What You Fight,” in which he blames the Jews for “creating feminism.”</p>
<p>“Who created feminism? Who pushes their ideas? The Jews,” Valizadeh wrote. “They were crafty, intelligent, persistent, and masters of propaganda. Their negative influence on Western civilization must be countered.”</p>
<p>He has published other antisemitic material as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They can whine all they want because at 7:30pm this Saturday, I will share the location of the Starbucks we’re meeting at <a href="https://twitter.com/rooshv">on my Twitter</a> (it’s within walking distance of Metro Center). Find me inside between 8-8:30pm to get the location of the main event, which will not be publicized online. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/178944/june-16-stop-violence-against-women-happy-hour-in-washington-d-c">Click here for full details</a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday night I ran into several readers and they had some questions/concerns about the happy hour…</p>
<h4><strong>“Is this a real event?”</strong></h4>
<p>Yes this is a real event. I will arrive to the Starbucks at 8pm. We will go to another bar at 8:30pm to eat, drink, and talk.</p>
<h4><strong>“I’m scared I will get doxed.”</strong></h4>
<p>As a man who has taken many large risks in life, I want to meet like-minded men who also like to task risks, though currently the risk for you to attend this event is rather small. Understand that I have it worst—I will be a sitting duck for half an hour to everyone in the metropolitan DC area who hates me and knows how I look like.</p>
<p>My best advice for men with sensitive jobs is to wear sunglasses and approach the Starbucks as if you were inching into a cold pool. Observe the surroundings carefully as you get closer. If the water gets too cold, withdraw momentarily. You only need to have a 30-second interaction with me to get details of the private venue.</p>
<h4>“Isn’t your birthday on June 14, the same day as Donald Trump’s?”</h4>
<p>Yes, today is our birthday. I turn 39.</p>
<h4><strong>“I’m a girl… can I come?”</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-179636" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jewish-reporter.jpg" alt="" width="372" height="520"></p>
<p>Three girls in the DC area have asked me about attending. As long as you don’t attention whore, are not a journalist, refrain from debates, and stay in the back, you are allowed to come.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-178946" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/06/starbucks-main.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="403"></p>
<p>If my Twitter is banned for whatever reason, <a href="https://gab.ai/rooshv">check my Gab</a>. This event will not be livestreamed, though if there are protesters I will film them for laughs. See you on Saturday.</p>
