<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>The government and society is waging war on men’s sexuality. We are being attacked for being men. Everything that is perceived to be male or masculine is being attacked, put down, condemned, and criticized. The general idea is the attacks are simply the outgrowth of feminism; this is partially true. The attacks are from feminism’s parent ideology. The war on men’s sexuality are <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/prevention/english/e_plit">organized lies</a> to reshape western reality, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/32868/student-expelled-after-college-includes-rumors-and-ashe-schow">eliminate due process</a>, and replace our constitution with a totalitarian rule.</p>
<p>Consider the organized lies of such things as mansplaining, manspreading, manterrupting, male privilege, toxic masculinity, rape culture, the patriarchy, etc. How many have considered these to be broader tactics for the regulation of men’s sexuality and the eventual regulation of men, and thus the population as a whole?</p>
<p>Most young people are not familiar with cultural war tactics. While the tactics can change, the general concepts are the same as general warfare. Many men in the west do not realize that Western society is at war with them. Male sexuality and masculinity are under attack from every progressive front. Progressives begin by corrupting children when they are young. SJWs hate it when children tell them the truth.</p>
<h3>The Rewriting of History</h3>
<p>Men like sex. Men want sex. Many women like sex and want sex. The sex drive in humans is powerful. Women have a powerful sex drive too. Men’s sex drive is typically more on display because men respond more to visual sexual stimuli while women respond more to emotional sexual stimuli.</p>
<p>Some of the most natural activities of men are now being regulated, made illegal, or redefined. Rape culture is one example of an attempt at redefining male sexuality. The advocates of <a href="https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/why-do-men-have-to-be-taught-not-to-rape-call-for-response-stopsexism-jrmk/">rape culture claim the <em>desire to rape</em></a> is within every man and always lurking beneath the surface in every man and men “<a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/05/who-really-created-rape-culture-mona-charen/">must be taught not to rape</a>”.</p>
<p>In November 2017 New York Times columnist Stephen Marche published an article titled “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/25/opinion/sunday/harassment-men-libido-masculinity.html">The Unexamined Brutality of the Male Libido</a>.” He compares the sexual libido in men to vampires and werewolves. The Obama Administration’s “Dear Colleagues” letter, a letter designed specifically to subvert U.S. law and due process as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution created the environment and framework <a href="http://thefederalist.com/2018/01/16/revoking-obamas-sex-assault-letter-wont-end-campus-witch-hunts/">for the regulation of sexual relations</a> between men and women.</p>
<p>Over the last several years, media attention has exploded in coverage of transgender events and individuals. The media is widespread with articles about boys competing in women’s competitive sports. Naturally, the competitors that were born as boys defeat the women. In November 2017, the New York Times published an article titled, “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/style/his-eye-makeup-is-way-better-than-yours.html">His Makeup Is Way Better Than Yours</a>”. The article praises young men that decide to wear makeup and their masterful application of makeup.</p>

<p>Gay activist Daniel Villarreal wrote an article titled, “<a href="https://www.queerty.com/can-we-please-just-start-admitting-that-we-do-actually-want-to-indoctrinate-kids-20110512">Can We Please Just Start Admitting That We Do Actually Want To Indoctrinate Kids</a>” expressing frustration with gay community leaders in constantly reciting the lie that the gay community does not want to “indoctrinate” children.</p>
<p>A group at Claremont College call “5C Thrive” held a workshop discussing “<a href="https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8210">the mental health problems caused by masculinity</a>”. Several <a href="https://www.campusreform.org/?ID=8645">other colleges</a> are offering “safe spaces” from “toxic masculinity.”</p>
<p>When progressives constantly call President Trump and his supporters “Nazis” this is a deception and attempt at rewriting history and painting the Nazis as something different from socialism. The Nazis were socialists. Fascists are a socialists. <a href="https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2018/05/adolf-hitlers-debt-karl-marx/">Hitler himself declared the party socialist. Hitler advocated for “a socially just state.”</a></p>
<h3>The Creation of an Enemy</h3>
<p>Many more examples could be given. Since the U.S. Constitution forbids the passage of <a href="https://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/1/essays/62/bill-of-attainder">Bills of Attainder</a>, the current cultural tactic, organized lying tactic, being used is to <em>paint all human vices as exclusively the result of “the patriarchy”, male, and male sexuality and thus any man as a perpetrator of said vice</em>. It is no coincidence that most feminists are devout socialists.</p>
<p>Progressives will gladly accept a world with enforced poverty, will publicly decry totalitarian organized lies of “inequality”, all while accepting an extreme hierarchical order and rigid class structure as exists <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/04/25/chinas-new-class-hierarchy-a-guide/">in China</a> and existed in Soviet society.</p>

<p>SJWs cannot bear reality so everything becomes political. George Orwell stated in his article, <a href="http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/prevention/english/e_plit">The Prevention of Literature</a>, how <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2018/06/16/dem-rep-child-migrant-crisis/">organized lying</a> is part of the integral fabric of <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/video/2018/06/16/msnbc-panelists-accuse-trump-of-operating-illegal-immigrant-concentration-camps-your-kids-could-be-next/">totalitarianism to shape and constantly reshape reality</a>. Literature, art, music, science, knowledge, technology, and sex are heavily politicized to perpetuate and push the organized lies and fit the “correct” ideology and narrative. The Mainstream Media, the Deep State, and other organizations are part of a large apparatus of systematic lying to destabilize society, divide the people, and remove due process as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and obtain political power. History is constantly rewritten to facilitate the reshaping of the present reality and the writing of the future.</p>

<p>In all societies that are socialist, or desire to be socialist, there has to be an enemy, usually fabricated, a group to receive blame for what socialists will label as “societal injustices”. The Chinese Communists, the Soviets, and the Nazis, all had people and groups that were used as <strong><em>initial lackeys and targets</em></strong> to promote and spread the organized lies and the war, the revolution in the progressive or socialist mind. Crimes committed by “protected classes” which are considered to be “victims” are explained away as the result of oppression and the “societal injustices” perpetuated by the “enemy of the people”.</p>
<p>Some of these people and groups were later targeted and labeled as “enemies of the people” and exterminated. Concentration camps and labor camps are common in communist countries. Hitler did not come up with <a href="https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2018/05/adolf-hitlers-debt-karl-marx/">the idea of concentration camps on his own</a>. Hitler copied what was already <a href="http://www.ukemonde.com/genocide/margolisholocaust.html">being done in the Soviet Union</a>.</p>
<p>“Enemy of the people” is a broad and fluid term used to attack anyone that is a potential ideological opponent, anyone who is a potential threat to the regime, or anyone considered to be subpar, weak, ideologically impure, or undesirable. As Augusto Zimmermann stated in his article “Adolf Hitler’s Debt to Karl Marx” these “enemies of the people” were arrested and executed for what they were and not any specific crime and the repressive machinery created by Marxists is then used to “<a href="https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2018/05/adolf-hitlers-debt-karl-marx/">hunt people down, to destroy their lives not for what such people have done but because of their social ‘category’</a>”. Targeting a social class for extermination or enslavement is not any different than exterminating or enslaving a race or demographic group.</p>

<p>Socialists want to force people into what they think is a perfect society. This society would be <a href="https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/qed/2018/05/adolf-hitlers-debt-karl-marx/">amoral and have no rights</a> since, according to Marx, morality and natural, civil, or human rights are oppressive tools used to suppress others. Male Privilege, White Privilege, or <a href="http://takimag.com/article/tackling_asian_privilege_gavin_mcinnes/print">Asian</a> <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/02/asians-face-racism-social-justice-warriors-accuse-them-privilege/">Privilege</a> are concocted terms and concocted crimes used to mask the elimination of the natural, God given rights, of a person or group of people, and the subsequent elimination of due process. The socialists in the Western world have chosen men as the current “enemy of the people”. These terms pave the way for imprisonment or death of men and white and Asian people for what they are and not any real crime and eventually anyone else that disagrees with them. Socialism wears the mask of benevolence and uses colorful language to disguise its inherent racism, genocide, theft, misandry, misogyny, and rot.</p>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<p>I like being a man. I love sex. I love women. I will not apologize for being a man, nor should you. The male sex drive, male sexuality, and sex are not vices any more than the female sex drive and female sexuality are virtues. Masculinity is not any more toxic than femininity. There are <strong><em>toxic <strong>people</strong>,</em></strong> both men and women. Do not tolerate and accept the ideology of progressives or accept that human vices are exclusively male and masculine. Reject the organized lies and realize you are at war.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Naked-Communist-Exposing-Communism-Restoring-ebook/dp/B00B76J804">Cleon Skousen</a> summed up what Marx, and thus socialists, really want.</p>
<blockquote><p>He visualized a regimented breed of Pavlovian men [people] whose minds could be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters. He wanted a race of men who would no longer depend upon free will, ethics, morals or conscience for guidance. Perhaps, without quite realizing it, Marx was setting out to create a race of human beings conditioned to think like criminals.</p></blockquote>
