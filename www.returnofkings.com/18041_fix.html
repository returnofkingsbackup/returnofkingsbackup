<h4>A New Idea</h4>
<p>Sometimes it is hard to come up with creative ideas and things to do with women. The usual dates such as dinner or movies have become the realm of the beta and the omega. Hitting up the the club or the bar for dancing and drinks has almost reached <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSVeDx9fk60">Groundhog Day</a> status with me. I came across a new activity to do with women almost by accident and its opportunities and prospects are lucrative.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mingolfgame.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18045" alt="mingolfgame" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mingolfgame.jpg" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mingolfgame.jpg 179w, wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mingolfgame-50x50.jpg 50w, wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mingolfgame-120x120.jpg 120w" sizes="(max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px"></a></p>
<p>While seducing a particular lady in a particular locale, I noticed there was a miniature golf course down the street. After finishing my meeting over coffee I told her I’d see her for a round of golf the next day. She informed me that she didn’t play golf. I told her I was referring to the miniature golf course and to be there at 1 o’clock. To make a long story short, I came in first and then I came in first again later.</p>
<p>While some can say planning miniature golf is juvenile, tell them you care what they think. It’s one of those secret ideal date locations. It allows you to observe the woman from all angles. It makes it hard for her to hide her flaws. You can see how she walks, bends over, and carries herself. It helps weed out the crypto-muffintops, drug addicts, and out of shape people. Also, commanding the woman to adhere to the rules of the course is a good way to gauge her femininity. This is a two way street though, so make sure you’re in shape and looking good in your clothes.</p>

<h4>Advantages</h4>
<p>Playing 18 holes of miniature golf allows you to dial up or down the intensity of the date. Maybe you misjudged a woman’s appearance in the dim light of the bar before but a second look in the sun changes your mind about her. The 18<sup>th</sup> hole is a definite end to allow you to have a clean break if you need to eject. It also gives you the opportunity to admire a well formed butt surreptitiously or not surreptitiously, depending on your level of caddishness. It also allows her to feel that she spent a lot of time with you, building up that comfort level to a bang.</p>
<p>Surprisingly the conversation is less scripted and the usual bar scene bitch defenses are lowered in a playful environment. She will be more forthcoming in revealing details about herself that she would normally be guarded about. She might let a few cats out of the bag about being a single mommy, recovering slut, or some other deal breakers.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The only possible con to miniature golf is a woman may see you as immature but you can parlay that in your favor. Miniature golf is relatively cheap so one does not have to worry about wasting money on a bang. I find miniature golf highly entertaining, so if the woman is a dud, the outing is not a total loss. So add the putt putt to your repertoire at least once and see if it works for you.</p>
