<p>I propose that the working class man should solely be with women who are only available on Fridays and Saturdays, from 7pm-2am. I’m a realist and I have been in relationships so I understand that not all hours in relationships are productive. Many of these hours are spent doing one’s own thing, which is understandable and ideal so as not to smother our partners. So I prefer we lump 14 hours of productivity into 2 days.</p>
<h4>The Ideal Schedule</h4>
<p>I’m all about efficiency and reducing bottlenecks. An ideal schedule would look something like this:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday Night:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>7pm to 9ish:</strong> Go to dinner where you share stories about your week.</li>
<li>
<strong>9ish-9:30pm:</strong> Come back home. Get in a quickie, depending on how well you escalated sexual tension at dinner.</li>
<li>
<strong>9:30-12am:</strong> Take a bubble bath together. Drink some wine while watching a movie or playing a board game until about midnight (in which time plenty of jokes can be told).</li>
<li>
<strong>12am-1am:</strong> Share some affectionate cuddling.</li>
<li>
<strong>1am-2am:</strong> End the night after an hour of sex (as long as you’re sleep by 2am).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Saturday Night:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>7-9pm:</strong> Go to dinner or a movie, or perhaps dancing or a comedy show.</li>
<li>
<strong>9-11pm:</strong> Come back home, or preferably her home. Have wine and play a video game or talk about a book together.</li>
<li>
<strong>11-12am:</strong> Escalate sexual tension.</li>
<li>
<strong>12am-1am:</strong> Enjoy the fruits of the sexual tension that should have been built an hour earlier.</li>
<li>
<strong>1am-2am:</strong> Cuddle and then sleep.</li>
</ul>
<p>This set-up allows for a win-win because you both can enjoy half of your weekend and your week days doing things that you want to do. The fact is, most people don’t, and shouldn’t have time for week day lovers anyway. I know I don’t. I have a son to raise, work to worry about, plenty of books to read, blog postings to write, and sleep to be had.</p>
<p>If one person just <em>has</em> to communicate during the week, then I suppose they should call, but I’d much rather they write their concerns on sticky notes and come prepared to discuss their notes on Friday evenings. In this manner, the couple would never have to worry about an awkward silence over dinner.</p>
<h4>Why A Schedule? Shouldn’t You Just Go with the Flow?</h4>
<p>Anything outside of these designated hours would disrupt the peace in the relationship. Also, too much information can come out way too soon. Have you ever felt pressured to “do something” just because your girl is around when you would rather be playing a video game or reading? Enjoy your “me” time. If your girl is worth anything, she’ll have her own things that she’s into and shouldn’t mind such a low-pressure relationship.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>And no, it’s not an issue of being a control freak, it’s rather practical. A schedule sets social boundaries. I like my free time, so I’ll assume everyone else does too.</p>
<p>There are likely some who would argue that there shouldn’t be a schedule for intimacy, but I would invite them to consider re-evaluating their thoughts. How many people do you know are in relationships that are void of intimacy because they <em>don’t</em> schedule it? There are plenty of social psychologists and relationship therapists who promote scheduling date time. You’ll just be one step ahead of the game.</p>
<p>Married or not, nothing fundamentally changes about relationships. Quality time always rules over quantity of time. As long as you can make the 14 hours memorable, romantic, respectful, concerning, genuine, and compassionate, your woman should always look forward to the next scheduled weekend date.</p>
<p>My proposed schedule doesn’t exclude spontaneity, surprises, or new ideas to enjoy each other’s company. As long as you and your girl are spending good quality time together, you two should be good.</p>
<h4>How do you convince your girl to submit to such a schedule?</h4>
<p>I propose that the ultimate measure of a man’s game is to get women to agree with things they wouldn’t otherwise imagine they’d enjoy. To do it without lies or deceit is even better—it’s not only “red pill domination,” but also Leadership 101. The excitement in accomplishing such a goal is as exhilarating as having sex with a woman on the first night, even though she had said earlier that she’d never do such a thing.</p>
<p>In order to convince your girl to submit to such a schedule, it’ll take communications and a channeling of her inner emotions with sincere, genuine tact, which Winston Churchill defined as “the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip.”</p>
<p>This is admittedly an extreme challenge. Females are needy and emotional. Thus, saying the wrong thing will quickly get your texts ignored and phone calls blocked. So challenge your inner “game” and see how would you get your girl to submit to your Friday and Saturday night only schedule, so that you can maximize your independence during your week days.</p>
