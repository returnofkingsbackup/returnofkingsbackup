<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>By far the most bewildering feature of the liberal worldview is their denial that they have any responsibility towards the generations of the future.  Liberals have a very low penchant for inter-generational responsibility. This is most observable in the stark differences between liberal parenting strategy and right-minded parenting.  This difference ultimately influences the amount of parental investment observed between the offspring of liberals and the offspring of right thinking peoples.</p>

</div>
<p>Liberals seem to show little concern for their own offspring or the well-being of their genetic descendants, preferring investment in the children of “others” to investment in their own. This contrasts sharply with the parental investment strategies of right-minded peoples who invest in their children as opposed to investing in the children of others.</p>
<h4>What Is Parental Investment?</h4>
<p>When I refer to parental investment in one’s offspring, I am alluding to the effort expended on raising them to become competent and confident members of the society in which they live. Such efforts include: time, attention, affection and monetary investment. These resources are finite and scarce by their very nature. Time spent working is time which you are unable to spend on hobbies, exercise and gaming. Time is a non-renewable resource.</p>
<div id="attachment_182170" style="width: 579px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-182170" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Madonna-Whore.jpg" alt="" width="569" height="379" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Madonna-Whore.jpg 750w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Madonna-Whore-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Madonna-Whore-360x240.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Poster child for misguided “charity.”</p>
</div>
<p>Likewise, money spent on a vacation is money that cannot be spent on a home. Money may be a renewable resource but in order to obtain it the non-renewable resource of time must be expended in its pursuit. The scarcity of the earth’s resources and the finite nature of time are readily understood by every child who has reached the age of reason.</p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering what resources and time expenditure have to do with liberalism and their penchant for low-investment strategies in their own offspring. I contend that right minded men and women invest heavily in their offspring at the expense of stranger’s offspring and that liberals invest heavily in the offspring of others at the expense of their own descendants, usually out of an irrational and misguided desire to virtue signal and a total disregard for the generations of descendants which succeed them.</p>
<h4>Case In Point</h4>

</div>
<p>This observation was highlighted for me recently when a recently divorced, co-worker of mine announced that he was moving in with his new girlfriend and her two children. This co-worker already has three children of his own. At the family level of parental investment, a man that has children and whom has been divorced owes it to his children to devote his energies to their development.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>When a man marries a single mother and blends his family with hers, he is transferring his resources, wealth, time and affection from children whom he has fathered onto the offspring of another man. It is right to assume that any man you meet who has married a single mother is a liberal of the highest magnitude as he is funding his children’s competition, or has no offspring of his own.</p>
<p>This is an obvious betrayal of one’s descendants and a slap in the face to one’s ancestors. Such a man is so emotionally needy and desperate for sex that he will jeopardize his investments in his own children in order to assuage his emotional and sexual needs.</p>
<h4>Societal Scope of Parental Mal-investment</h4>
<div id="attachment_182172" style="width: 524px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-182172" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/the-saddest-thing.png" alt="" width="514" height="384" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/the-saddest-thing.png 507w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/the-saddest-thing-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“How the hell did this happen?” Naive soy-boy</p>
</div>
<p>When men and women invest in the development and rearing of the children of others at the expense of their own, the injustice is palpable yet limited to the two families involved. This investment becomes more malicious when it is societal in scope.</p>
<p>At the benevolent end of parental investment in the offspring of “others,” liberals invest in their children’s competitors through the encouragement of mass migration into their ancestral home lands. They saddle their children with future dependents in the form of third-world immigrants and their offspring – truly, a gift that keeps on giving. Likewise, liberals saddle themselves and their children with overly generous welfare states which largely benefit immigrants and single mothers at the expense of the hard working people of their society.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, the malevolent end of parental investment, liberals even condone and participate in the murder of their own descendants in the wombs of their mothers. Nothing indicates a hatred of one’s own offspring more than murdering them in the womb; yet, abortion is the sacred sacrament of “tolerant” liberals everywhere. One cannot invest in the rearing of the children now dead and so liberals devote still more of their time into causes diametrically opposed to their surviving descendants.</p>
<h4>Privilege Your Own: In Group Preferencing</h4>
<div id="attachment_182171" style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-182171" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/soy-face-grin.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="448" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/soy-face-grin.jpg 225w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/soy-face-grin-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/soy-face-grin-125x125.jpg 125w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/soy-face-grin-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"><p class="wp-caption-text">That idiotic grin says it all.</p>
</div>
<p>The ultimate difference between liberals and right-minded parenting is the level of parental investment each group puts into their children and the level of commitment to ameliorating the conditions of future generations.</p>
<p>Liberal minded people will almost always invest in the offspring of others, whether by marrying single parents and forming “blended” families, encouraging the immigration of “others” into their countries thereby causing an influx of their children’s competition or by outright murdering their children in the womb.</p>
<p>In contrast, right minded people marry for life, have children with one spouse (barring exceptional circumstances such as re-marriage after the death of one’s spouse), and work hard raising them into proficient adults necessarily privileging their own children at the expense of others.</p>
