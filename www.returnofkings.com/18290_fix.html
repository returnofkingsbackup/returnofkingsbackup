</div>
<p>On March 13, 2006, a party was held at an off-campus house owned by Duke University.  In attendance were members of Duke’s lacrosse team.  Some of the players contacted an escort service named Allure and requested that two strippers to be sent to the house.  When the two strippers (Crystal Mangum and Kim Roberts) arrived, some of the students made it clear that the strippers were not the physical types they had asked for.  An argument ensued between some of the students and the girls; insults of various types were exchanged, and the two girls left.</p>
<p>Mangum, 27 years old at the time, had been working at strip clubs on and off since 2002.  By her own admission, she had been drinking alcohol and had ingested a muscle relaxant called Flexeril before arriving at the lacrosse players’ house.  She had a history of mental problems and consumption of a wide variety of medications and mood-stabilizers.  She had been previously convicted of stealing a car, and was arrested in 2002 for stealing a cab and leading police on a high-speed chase.  When 18 years old in 1996, she had told police that she had been raped by three men (for which she never provided corroborating details).  A security guard at Mangum’s strip club claimed that Mangum, after the party, stated her intention of wanting  to “get money” from the Duke boys who had not paid her.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mangum.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18293" alt="mangum" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mangum.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>Crystal Mangum, the despicable liar whose false allegations launched the case.</em></p>
<p>Roberts and Mangum sped away from the party in their car, and became involved in a heated argument.  Mangum refused to leave the car; Roberts called police for help; and Mangum was taken away to a substance abuse facility.  At this point she began to claim she had been raped at the party by “white” students.  In an instant, the tried-and-true racial genies were conjured up for the self-serving purposes by an opportunist and a liar.  Knowing what flags to wave and what accusations would stick, she hit the launch button on what would become a terrible drama.  A medical examination done at Duke University Medical Center did not find any injuries consistent with her claims of forcible rape.</p>
<p>After Mangum made her accusations, a terrifying sequence of events began to unfold, seemingly unstoppable, yet guided by the invisible hands of the powerful; and an avalanche of lies and innuendo obscured the most basic questions that should have been asked in any criminal investigation.  Durham Couny District Attorney Mike Nifong ordered DNA samples to be taken of the entire lacrosse team, even students who were not present.  When the test results failed to connect any team members with Mangum, Nifong had additional tests done at another laboratory.  The results of the second battery of tests were distorted and suppressed by Nifong and the lab director, Brian Meehan.  Nifong informed the court and the public that DNA had been found from only one male, Mangum’s boyfriend.  This was a lie.</p>
<p>In fact, the lab reports showed the DNA of at least four or five unidentified males in Mangum’s pubic area, rectum, and underwear.  Nifong knew this at the time.  The DNA report given to the students’ defense attorneys was incomplete and misleading, in that it contained no information about the exculpatory evidence.  Prosecutors have an ethical duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense.  He suppressed this evidence.  Meehan later admitted that the doctored DNA report was against his lab’s regular policy, but tried to explain it away by stating that he and Nifong did not want to “involve” any other persons.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>By this time, an army of attention-seekers, race-baiters, demagogues, guttersnipes, clowns, and knaves had begun to pontificate about the case.  The Duke students were subjected to harassment, vilification, and outright threats from all quarters.</p>
<p>The arrival of “journalists” at the sites of the latest scandals-du-jour are so routine by now that we could almost write their boilerplate editorials and speeches in our sleep.  Almost all voices were united in condemning the students, who were assumed to be guilty.  Journalists, almost all of them feminists, white knights, and manginas, worked themselves into a red-faced, froth-mouthed frenzy in attacking the “culture of privilege” supposedly displayed by the Duke students, their “frat-boy mentality”, and similar imagined social bugbears.</p>
<p>In April, 2006, two lacrosse players, Collin Finnerty and Reade Seligmann were arrested.  In May, David Evans, a former player, was arrested and indicted.  The charges included forcible rape, sexual offense, and kidnapping.  With blinding speed, and sensing the way the political winds were blowing, the institutions that could have stopped the railroading—the school, the hospital, the police, and the city—stood by in silence or actively helped to serve the students up to Nifong’s prosecutorial meat grinder.</p>
<p>In a civil lawsuit filed in 2008, after the criminal case had collapsed, the students alleged (in a two hundred page civil petition) a shocking litany of collusion and corruption between Nifong, the medical center, and Duke University.  Defendants named in the civil suit were the school, the hospital, the police, and the city.  The suit was settled this year (2013), but the terms have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>As the summer months of 2006 ground on, and as media attention reached a frenzy, the falsity of the entire case began to become more and more obvious.  Mangum’s story had so many inconsistencies and incredibilities that even Nifong’s double-talk and stammering in front of the news cameras could not conceal them.  The photo identification process used to help Mangum identify the “perpetrators” was exposed as a sham, as the officers conducted it improperly.  An alibi witness for one of the accused students was also apparently intimidated by police.</p>
<p>The superb lawyering of the students’ attorneys was instrumental in cutting through the lies and obfuscation that Nifong, Mangum, and their enablers had created.  In motion after motion, holes and inconsistencies in the case were highlighted.  Nifong refused to relent.  He dismissed the rape charges in December 2006, but kept the other charges.  Probably desperate for some sort of plea deal, but lacking the moral courage to abandon a fraudulent prosecution, he kicked the case upstairs.  He removed himself from the case and passed it on to the state’s attorney general.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nifong.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18294" alt="nifong" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nifong.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>Prosecutor Mike Nifong.  The arrogant smirk on his face would soon be wiped off.</em></p>
<p>But by this time, the tide had turned.  And so the wicked are ensnared in the traps which they set for others.</p>
<p>Like many such conflagrations in history, the kindler of the fire was himself consumed by the flames.  Nifong’s public statements showed a contemptuous disregard for the rights of the accused, and a disrespect towards the defense attorneys whose job it was to represent them.  The state bar of North Carolina filed ethics charges against Nifong, who was described as a “rogue prosecutor”; after an extended ethics inquest Nifong was disbarred for “dishonesty, fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation.”  He was also convicted of criminal contempt and spent a day in jail.</p>
<p>The revelations that came to light at the ethics hearing can only be described as shocking:  here was detailed a pattern of abuse of power, collusion with various authorities, and a level of skull-thumping stupidity as has scarcely been equaled in the annals of contemporary American justice.  Charges against all the accused players were dismissed, and the students were declared innocent.  Nifong’s demeanor in the hearings was a textbook example of the “banality of evil” (to use Hannah Arendt’s phrase):  he was able to summon up crocodile tears for the accused boys whose lives he tried to destroy, but the overall impression given by his testimony was that of a government drone overwhelmed by the forces which his power-drunk avarice had set in motion.</p>
<p>Some may see the outcome of the Duke rape case as a vindication of the ability of the system to correct itself.  Truth won out in the end, some have said.  But in many ways, the conclusion of the case left much to be desired.  Nifong’s description as a “rogue” was too comfortable and smug; at every step of the way, he was aided and abetted by the media and local institutions.  Safely labeling him a wild-eyed rogue conceals the roles played by powerful institutions (media, government, education) in fanning the flames of anti-male bigotry.</p>

</div>
<p>Nifong was only abandoned by the establishment when the tenacity of the defense attorneys exposed the whole charade.  One may wonder what would have happened had the students not been able to hire competent counsel.  The case exposed just to what extent feminism and political correctness had rotted the souls of the existing institutions.  Like France’s Dreyfus Affair, the Duke case exposed for all the world the callous, wicked, and rotten nature of the contemporary American establishment.</p>
<p>And the mentality continues.  To cite just one of many examples, former Atlanta Falcons football player Brian Banks recently had a rape conviction overturned under circumstances that shock the conscience.  Banks, a star football player with a bright future, had been falsely accused of rape by a cynical and vicious teenage classmate.  Facing the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence, he pled guilty for something he didn’t do, and served five years in prison.  His accuser and her mother proceeded to shake down the school with a phony lawsuit and got a huge settlement.  On his release, the girl contacted him on Facebook and offered to “help” him clear his name as long as she didn’t have to give the settlement money back.</p>
<p>Unbelievable.  He recorded the meeting and used it to help clear his name.  But he had lost five precious years of his life. Under Roman law, a person who wrongly accused another of a crime was guilty of <em>calumnia</em>.  The penalty for <em>calumnia </em>was for the lying accuser to be subjected to the same range of punishment as the crime alleged.  I like this old Roman law, and think it should be adopted today.  The deterrent effect would be enormous.</p>
<p>How many innocent men are rotting in jails today, due to their lack of financial resources?  How many men have been deprived of their livelihoods, due to the cowardice of a feminist-dominated system that throws them to the wolves immediately after accusations are leveled against them?  The lesson here is that no man can put his unqualified faith in the system or the government to protect him.  Institutions exist to support the prevailing orthodoxy.  And if that orthodoxy is anti-male, pro-feminist, and politically correct, an honest man cannot expect a fair deal.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/accused.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-18306" alt="accused" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/accused.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Another vital lesson here is that the legion of manginas, leftists, tattooed hipsters, and assorted cowards who cheered on Nifong and white-knighted for Mangum were all men.  More harm has been done to men in the name of feminism by men than by women.  The worst enemy of the masculine, honest man is not the female feminist, but the male feminist.  It was men in the local establishment institutions who looked the other way or acquiesced in the feeding frenzy.  Mangum was a guttersnipe, of course, but she did not occupy a place of power or influence.  At any point, she could (and should) have been put in check.  This did not happen.  Those in power sat there and did nothing.  They only acted when the outcome was no longer in doubt.  No one was willing to stick his neck out and defend the men.  Almost all news outlets refused even to show a photograph, or to give the name, of the false accuser Mangum.</p>
<p>In a healthy society, a Crystal Mangum would be severely punished for her false testimony, which nearly destroyed the lives of numerous men.  As it happened, the state attorney who took over the case from Nifong chose to give her a pass, stating it was “in the best interests of justice” not to prosecute her.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">And so she was allowed to continue harming people, over and over again.  In 2010, she was arrested on charges of attempted murder, arson, assault, identity theft, resisting arrest, and child abuse.  She was convicted at a jury trial of several misdemeanor charges, among them child abuse.  In 2011, she was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, for allegedly stabbing her boyfriend.  He later died.  At the time of writing, the case is still pending.  Not one single feminist, mangina, or white knight has ever come forward to demonstrate for the rights of Mangum’s many victims.  There is only silence.  Where are they now?  Mangum has even written a “book” to try to cash in on her criminality.</span></p>
<p>Selena Roberts, a journalist who worked as a writer for the <em>New York Times</em> when the Duke case broke, was interviewed in 2008 about her afterthoughts on the case.  She had been one of the more strident voices in pre-judging and condemning the students.  But even in 2008, a year after the case had collapsed, she could not admit she had been wrong.  About anything.  Ever.  Her statements from the interview, recorded below, provoke fury in their callousness, cruelty, hatefulness, and insensitivity to the rights of the persecuted.  Read them and decide for yourself:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Q: Which column – over the span of your career – have you taken the most heat for? Why do you think readers were so upset?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Duke Lacrosse.  No question. Basically, I wrote that a crime didn’t have to occur for us to inspect the irrefutable evidence of misogyny and race baiting that went on that night. Not a popular stand. I received lots of hate mail, some of it threatening. I think the intense response came from Duke-player supporters who felt threatened when someone, whether it was me or another columnist, started poking at the culture of affluence and entitlement. We’re always dissecting the African-American and Hispanic communities – is it gangs? is it the rap lyrics? – when trouble strikes minority athletes. Obviously, some segments of the Duke lacrosse crowd did not enjoy the scrutiny of their world.</p>
<p>So, in <a href="https://twitter.com/SelenaRoopstigo">Selena Roberts’s</a> world, it doesn’t even matter whether a crime occurred or not.  To her, there was “irrefutable evidence” of “misogyny” and “race baiting”.  If anything sums up the mentality of the modern-day feminist Inquisitor or commissar, it is this way of thinking.  Facts, reality, and truth don’t matter. <em> What matters is my agenda.</em>  <em>The destruction of an innocent man means nothing to me.  </em><em>What matters is my personal vendettas and axes to grind.  I have a right to use a fake case to make some bigger point about (in her words), “the culture of affluence and entitlement”</em>.  Which is feminist code words for white men.  And notice also the nice little whiff of martyrdom she throws in there.  She actually tries to make herself look like a hero (“not a popular stand”), when in fact she was a willing member of the executioners’ squad against the Duke boys.  The rationalization would be shocking, were it not so routine.</p>
<p>Ms. Roberts even sees fit to lecture us on race.  <em>Unbelievable</em>.  She tries to portray herself as a defender of African-American and Hispanic communities by taking on the big, bad Duke twenty year old lacrosse players.  Since Ms. Roberts is so sensitive to minority rights, I’d like to ask her:  has she spoken out against the false rape accuser in the Brian Banks case, cited above?  Brian Banks happened to be black, and the Duke boys were white.  Well, have you, Ms. Roberts?  Or is there only “misogyny and race-baiting” when the falsely accused men are white?</p>
<p>Selena Roberts’s hateful, bigoted, and sickening comments should be condemned in the strongest terms.  She obviously doesn’t respect the legal decision in the Duke rape case.  And obviously she doesn’t care about truth or justice.  People should know her attitudes.  This is why I have quoted her here.</p>
<p>Make no mistake:  these people mean what they say, and will go to any lengths to hurt those they believe represent “affluence and entitlement”.  You are not safe from their cross-hairs unless you are fat, gay, a lapdog mangina, a simpering white knight, a listless loser, a tattooed hipster, or some other worthless person who endorses their worldview.  If you fit this description, they will love you.</p>
<p>They hate anyone better than them.  And this is why I have said before, and continue to say, that feminism is not just a threat to men, but a threat to civilization itself.  These people desire to extirpate healthy masculinity to make the world safe and prosperous for degenerates, freaks, monsters, and other human detritus.  And they are succeeding.  At stake is nothing less than the continued viability of Western civilization.  It is not certain whether men will rise to the challenge and combat these forces.</p>
<p>When the history of this age is eventually written, the mentality of people like this will be held up as the plague bacillus which helped to poison, corrupt, and destroy the foundations of a healthy social order.</p>
