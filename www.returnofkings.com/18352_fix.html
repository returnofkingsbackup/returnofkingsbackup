<p>I live in Austin, Texas, the most overrated city on the planet, and although I would not care to hang out with Mr. <strong>Romeo Rose</strong>, I wanted to write about his plight.</p>
<p>Not sure who Romeo Rose is? You must not plugged in to the awesome (sarc) Austin social media scene. Fortunately, I’m not either, so I found out about him from a friend who wastes too much time on social media.</p>
<p>Apparently, Mr. Rose was a local wanna-be musician and <a href="http://romeorose.com/">part-time wedding photographer</a> who, according to an Austin grrrl power reporterette, calls his awful guitar “<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/who-is-romeo-rose-the-biggest-prick-the-world">the most beautiful guitar in the universe</a>.” Any musician who would say such a thing without prefacing it “after the <a href="http://www.evhgear.com/frankenstein/">Frankenstrat</a> or <a href="http://www.guitaraficionado.com/the-guitar-collection-jimi-hendrixs-1968-fender-stratocaster.html">Jimi’s Fender</a>” is indeed a clown. He’s also allegedly a <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lol/romeo-rose-sleepless-in-austin-ad/">9/11 troofer</a>. Not exactly the kind of guy I would want to party with. There were also other allegations involving the man, but I am leaving those out because I could not find better substantiation of the claims (granted, I wasn’t about to spend hours looking this up).</p>
<p>Mr. Rose “rose” to prominence recently after he posted a website seeking his ideal Mrs. Right at <a href="http://sleeplessinaustin.atxmirrors.info/">SleeplessInAustin.com</a>. He is so sleepless that he’s even offering a finder’s fee to anybody who can help him find a girl. On the site he included a list comprising <a href="http://sleeplessinaustin.atxmirrors.info/about_the_girl.html">thirty-nine paragraphs</a> of what the future Juliet should be to this Romeo. And what is he looking for? Let me quote him (<em>sic</em> throughout):</p>
<ul>
<li>“I want the girl to be attractive.”</li>
<li>“I like girls that are thin, or with a toned or athletic build. . . . I will not date a overweight or fat girl.”</li>
<li>“I also like girls with long hair. I like a girl to look like a girl, not a man, I like a feminine, pretty girl.”</li>
<li>“I will not date a girl that does not have a job or career.”</li>
<li>“I do not like tattoos on a woman.”</li>
<li>“I do not like glasses on a girl.”</li>
<li>“I do not like strippers! I will not date any girl that has ever been a stripper.”</li>
<li>“I will not date any girl that has ever had a threesome, or a large number of past sexual partners. I do not want a promiscuous slut.”</li>
<li>“I will not date any girl that can not always be honest &amp; faithful to me.”</li>
<li>“I prefer a woman that has never had children.”</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so it sounds like he isn’t looking for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Angelina">Eva Angelina</a>. I can understand that; he prefers redheads, so… well, I can’t think of the names of any redheaded chicks right now, so this wise-ass comment just died.</p>
<p>But, as a man, I can completely understand where he is coming from. Who among us wants to date a fatty? Who among us wants a girl who looks like a man or even a post-op tranny? Do you want to date a fug? Are lazy, unemployed, skanky, slutty, tatted-up strippers your cup of tea for a long-term relationship? Hell, no!</p>

</div>
<p>So why am I even discussing this guy? Well, he included this item:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<b>I will not date a Black girl. I don’t care if she looks like Halle Berry, I will not ever date a Black girl</b>.”</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so this was a “<em>d00d WTF were you thinking???</em>” moment, mainly because I still dig Vanessa Williams, but if that is the way he feels, well, to each his own.</p>
<p>But his list and final point listed above opened the floodgates of h8red from the haters in the Cathedral.</p>
<p>The harridans at <a href="http://jezebel.com/delusional-man-child-has-most-incredible-list-of-dating-1382052948">Jezebel unloaded on him</a>.</p>
<p>So did the chicks at <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/09/25/sleepless_in_austin_like_sleepless_in_seattle_only_with_racism_and_misogyny/singleton/">Salon</a>.</p>
<p>And the “men” at <a href="http://gawker.com/racist-romeo-willing-to-pay-for-non-fat-non-slut-non-1385130657">Gawker</a>.</p>
<p>Then the Huffington Post joined the fray, and even arranged an interview between Mr. Rose and Ms. Caitlyn Becker, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/sleepless-in-austin-interview-awful_n_3997377.html">their not-exactly-svelte reporter</a>.</p>
<p>The Cathedral pounced like an angry animal as soon as they had the chance to scream <em>RACIST!</em> at Mr. Rose. Within a few days of this man’s rather silly and innocuous website going live he went from a local with a clownish reputation to the latest example of the RACIST AmeriKKKan patriarchy.</p>
<p>Now, before I proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions of Ms. Becker:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you date a guy shorter than you?</li>
<li>What about a guy who does not earn over $100,000 per year?</li>
<li>What about a guy with an educational background not as “stellar” as yours?</li>
</ul>
<p>Yup, just what I thought. <strong>No</strong>, <strong>no</strong> and <strong>no</strong>.</p>
<p>The entire Romeo Rose affair isn’t about the media calling out a fool who made bigoted comments. Instead, it’s another obnoxious display of the <strong>double-standard employed by wimmin regarding preferences in a partner</strong>. I’m sure Ms. Becker, the women at Jizzabel, the women at Salon, and (most likely) the “men” at Gawker all have their list of 300+ firm requirements in a man. And a good portion of these will be related to looks. Meanwhile, a local goofball has now become a national whipping boy for daring to list in thirty-nine paragraphs what he’d like to see in a woman.</p>
<p><strong>How dare he have standards!</strong></p>
<p>But I will leave Mr. Rose with one piece of advice: you won’t find your Juliet in Austin. Not in a town where the feminists and their manboob allies would rather have <a href="http://youtu.be/8Dp6KtPoBxw">mob rule</a> than a democratic process adhering to procedural rules.</p>
<p>Maybe Verona, Italy would be a better place to start looking.</p>
