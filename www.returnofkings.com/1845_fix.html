<p>The Kyiv Post <a href="http://www.kyivpost.com/opinion/op-ed/parade-of-expats-who-love-ukraine-317606.html">recently profiled Western men</a> who moved to Ukraine. This passage immediately stuck out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the first years I came here, things were a bit different in terms of Ukrainians’ attitude toward foreigners, especially Americans. <strong>We were looked upon with great interest and intrigue</strong> as most common Ukrainians had never seen an American before.</p>
<p>Another American told me that he had felt like some kind of “rock star” while visiting here. I was once asked myself by three city workers to pose with them so they could take a picture with me at the big fountain on Maidan Nezalezhnosti.</p>
<p>Khreshchatyk Street was different then, too, without so much of the high-end retail shops. That was then. <strong>Things aren’t the same now …and not as friendly as it was then.</strong> Many Ukrainians seem unhappy, if not a bit hostile. People are not as interested about my being here or showing what native English speakers call “wide-eyed curiosity.” Some do, but most don’t seem to care where I am from, much less ask for a picture with me as they once did…most just ask why I am staying here and don’t go home.</p>

<p>In ten years, Americans went from being seen as celebrities to people who don’t belong. It’s upsetting that I could have had rock star status in my recent trip there, but I know that in ten years there will be many men lamenting the fact that they missed the boat on the Brazils and Polands that me and my penis got to vigorously experience.</p>
<p>Older Western men are now forced to use mail order bride agencies in order to meet feminine women. Here is a documentary that chronicles this phenomenon, featuring Tony “The Love Machine”:</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/8wW7c58nMI4%3Frel=0.html" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>And how about the men who want to sleep with Ukrainian women without meeting them through a bridal agency? That’s where I come in. I wrote a 103-page book called <em>Bang Ukraine </em>that teaches you how to sleep with Ukrainian women during a visit to the country. It contains tourist tips, game advice, and sex stories that give you all the information you need to bang hyper-feminine Ukrainian women, with extra details not released on the blog. <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/bang-ukraine"><strong>Click here to learn more about the book</strong></a>.</p>
