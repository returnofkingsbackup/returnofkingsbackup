<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p><em>The following article is sponsored <a href="https://synapsesupps.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">by Synapse Supplements</a>.</em></p>
<p>As a man who is out to succeed, you need to be on your A-game at all times. Keeping your body and mind in top condition is mandatory for whatever you’re looking to do, whether you want to excel at work, impress a girl on a date, or perform in the gym. Unfortunately, many modern foods and drinks are full of substances that muddle your thinking and make you logy and tired.</p>
<p>To get the edge you need to succeed every day, you need nootropics, special substances that boost your brain function by giving you more energy, a better memory, and other positive effects. Here are seven nootropic substances that you can use to give your brain a boost when you need it the most.</p>
<h3>1. Uridine monophosphate</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-185182" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Uridinmonophosphat.png" alt="" width="527" height="473"></p>
<p>One major problem when doing mind-intensive work is keeping your eye on the ball and avoiding distractions. Uridine monophosphate is a nootropic that can lengthen your attention span, allowing you to focus for longer periods of time and get more work done.</p>
<p>Not only that, uridine monophosphate can also improve your mood, smoothing over depression and making you more calm and collected. Scientific studies have also shown that uridine monophosphate increases neuroplasticity, making it a good substance to take when you’re studying something new.</p>
<h3>2. CDP choline</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-185175" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Citicoline.png" alt="" width="521" height="301"></p>
<p>CDP choline is a nootropic that aids memory and brain function by increasing the density of your brain’s acetylcholine receptors, improving their performance and making them more efficient. Acetylcholine is a major neurotransmitter responsible for pain response and a number of other brain functions, and denser receptors allow for a more efficient nervous system.</p>
<h3>3. Phosphatidylserine</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-185171" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chemical.png" alt="" width="550" height="285" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chemical.png 2763w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chemical-300x155.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/chemical-768x398.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>Phosphatidylserine is a vital component of cell membranes, playing a role in coagulation (the clotting of cuts) and other important cell functions. As a nootropic, phosphatidylserine binds to neurotransmitters in the brain, allowing them to more easily absorb glucose, which improves overall brain function.</p>
<h3>4. DMAE</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-185176" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/dmae.jpg" alt="" width="453" height="486"></p>
<p>DMAE (dimethylaminoethanol) is a nootropic that has been shown to increase attention span and concentration, making it possible to focus on tasks for a longer period of time and get more work done. Not only that, DMAE has been shown to have strong neuroprotective qualities, slowing down the aging and deterioration of brain cells. It’s because of this that DMAE has increasingly been used to treat sufferers of Alzheimer’s and other degenerative brain disorders.</p>
<h3>5. Bacopa monnieri</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-185170" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bacopa_monnieri.jpg" alt="" width="511" height="420"></p>
<p>Bacopa monnieri is a nootropic that improves both spatial and working memory, making it easier for you to recall and absorb information. This makes it an exceptionally useful nootropic for those who need to study for a test or absorb information in a learning setting. Not only that, bacopa monnieri has been shown to lower stress due to providing increases in adaptogenic stress inhibition, calming you down and making you more relaxed and less anxious.</p>
<h3>6. Ginkgo biloba</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-185178" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ginkgo.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="309" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ginkgo.jpg 3872w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ginkgo-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/ginkgo-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>Ginkgo biloba is a versatile nootropic that greatly enhances short- and long-term memory recall. In addition to this, it is also capable of greatly improving blood circulation in the brain, improving your brain health and lowering the risk of a stroke. Finally, ginkgo biloba has been shown to increase concentration.</p>
<h3>7. Lion’s mane</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-185179" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lions-mane.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="323" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lions-mane.jpg 800w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lions-mane-300x176.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2018/07/lions-mane-768x451.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></p>
<p>Finally, lion’s mane is an extremely helpful nootropic because it speeds the creation of nerves and neurotransmitters in the brain. This not only improves brain function across the board, but reduces the likelihood of developing dementia and other degenerative brain disorders.</p>
