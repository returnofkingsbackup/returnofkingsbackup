<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Having casual sex with promiscuous women is not a sport, but it does take on sport-like attributes if you do it for decades. To a normal man, getting laid mostly involves a night of drinking heavily and getting lucky, but to a more serious man like myself, there is <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-roosh-program">discipline</a>, <a href="https://www.rooshvstore.com/relationships">work ethic</a>, and penis hacks that allow me to keep going in a way that has prevented many other men from reaching their fornication goals.</p>
<p>I’m inching closer to 40, but thanks to some tinkering, I’ve been able to maintain my sexual vigor at nearly the same level as when I was 25. Here are five things I do…</p>
<h3>1. I eat two eggs every day</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-186149" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/eggs-over-easy.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="452"></p>
<p>I’m convinced that egg yolks are God’s elixir to man. I don’t have any scientific evidence to prove it, but eating two eggs a day has noticeably increased my horniness, along with other <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-decline-in-testosterone-is-destroying-the-basis-of-masculinity">testosterone</a> boosting foods like broccoli and avocados. While a lot of men go on testosterone replacement therapy to increase their T levels, I believe lifestyle changes concerning diet and weightlifting will get you there without the pharmaceutical dependency.</p>
<h3>2. I moisturize my penis with coconut oil</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-186147" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/coconut-oil.jpg" alt="" width="575" height="463"></p>
<p>As you get older, your penis will get less supple. You may also get chafing or dryness from rough sex sessions. On days I have sex, I lather my penis with extra virgin coconut oil after showering. I maintain that regimen for a few days until my penis is silky smooth to the touch. I also rub coconut oil in the pubic area to combat any vaginal yeast odor that wants to attach itself to me.</p>
<p>Not only does coconut oil help your skin, but it gives your penis a tropical fresh smell for any lucky lady that gets near it.</p>
<h3>3. I conserve precious seminal fluids when not getting laid</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-186151" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/every-drop-counts.jpg" alt="" width="577" height="263"></p>
<p>Within the past couple of years, I can actually feel a mild hangover the day after I masturbate. I believe it is due to my body marshaling its resources to replenish the valuable sperm that I wasted into the ether. More crucially, masturbation takes sex off my mind for at least a couple days, which is bad when you want to have sex with a real-life female.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>These days, I only masturbate when I’m approaching a sexual emergency, but not more than twice a week, and never with <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-documentary-hot-girls-wanted-shows-the-destructiveness-of-porn">hardcore pornography</a>. Young men can probably masturbate daily and still have plenty of fluid left over for sex, but not when you’re my age.</p>
<h3>4. I empty my balls with every sexual encounter</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-186150" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/empty-gas-tank.jpg" alt="" width="554" height="377"></p>
<p>I’ve lost count how many times I’ve received compliments from girls in their early 20’s about how I can go for more rounds than guys their age. The reason is that when I’m with a girl, I assume that it is the last time I will ever have sex, because you never know. I keep going until I no longer get a boner or faint. If I haven’t been laid in a while, the girl will get the night of her life and certainly come back for seconds. I’ve surprised myself with my endurance on hundreds of occasions.</p>
<p>One thing I don’t like about having a girlfriend is that I have to space out my orgasms to keep some gas in the tank, but the drawback is that sex stays on my mind throughout the week. I much prefer Ball Drainage Events so that I can’t do anything but focus on work for several days.</p>
<h3>5. I maintain proper urethra functioning with 100% pure cranberry juice</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-186148" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/cranberries.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="427"></p>
<p>Even if you use a condom, it’s not rare for the tip of your penis to at some point come into contact with a girl’s vaginal fluids. This could lead to a urethral irritation or a urinary tract infection that falls short of a full-blown sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>After I sleep with a questionable girl, which is most of the time, I buy a 500 milliliter bottle of 100% cranberry juice and take 100 milliliter doses every eight hours until the bottle is done. I’ve knocked out some crotchal symptoms with this formula, including a case of acute ball pain. Be sure to check the label of any cranberry juice you buy, because it may be adulterated with apple or grape juice.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>If you’re finding yourself less horny than before, or if you take too long to recover from a dynamite sex session, the things I listed above will keep you in peak physical shape for when sexual duty calls. I’m confident they’ll keep me fornicating at a professional level for at least three more decades.</p>
