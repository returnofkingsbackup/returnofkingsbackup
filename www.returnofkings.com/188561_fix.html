<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>What sort of new technologies was President Trump referring to when he proclaimed in his inaugural address that we’re “at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space”?</p>
<p>The statement implies President Trump has had plans for The Space Force for quite some time. Is it because President Trump has had access to secret knowledge about the inventions of famous Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla? The same Tesla that Elon Musk named his company after? Is it possible that knowledge about Tesla’s inventions is the source of President Trump’s confidence concerning a forthcoming branch of the military, The Space Force?</p>
<p>Wait, what? A link between President Trump and Nikola Tesla that has something to do with the Space Force? It all make sense shorty. Firstly, who was Nikola Tesla?</p>
<h4>Nikola Tesla</h4>
<div id="attachment_188563" style="width: 372px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-188563" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Tesla-Guy.jpeg" alt="" width="362" height="515"><p class="wp-caption-text">“When natural inclination develops into a passionate desire, one advances toward his goal in seven-league boots.”</p>
</div>
<p>Nikola Tesla was a man ahead of his time. An inventor originally from Serbia, Nikola Tesla immigrated to the United States in the 1890’s where he patented the induction motor, the magnifying transmitter, Tesla coil, Tesla Turbine, shadowgraphs, neon lamps, and alternating current.</p>
<p>Tesla had many other ideas for inventions including an earthquake machine, a thought camera, wireless energy, and an artificial tidal wave machine. Tesla’s most notable idea of all was a frickin’ laser beam also referred to as a death ray, death beam, or Teleforce. <b style="font-weight: normal;"> </b></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-188680" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.20.48-PM.png" alt="" width="477" height="247" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.20.48-PM.png 477w, wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-14-at-4.20.48-PM-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px"></p>
<p>Tesla’s social circle consisted of Thomas Edison and Samuel Clemens. He received a congratulatory letter on his 75th birthday from Albert Einstein and was at one point contacted by <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/160952/10-lessons-i-learned-from-henry-ford">Henry Ford</a> himself.  In 1901, J.P. Morgan bought a 51 % stake in Nikola Tesla’s patents and future inventions for $150,000.</p>
<p>When Tesla died in 1943, the FBI raided his apartment. Leading the task force that confiscated Tesla’s papers was none other than former MIT Professor, John G. Trump.</p>

<h4>The Trump Effect</h4>
<div id="attachment_188566" style="width: 548px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-188566 " src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-13-at-6.51.25-PM.png" alt="" width="538" height="283" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-13-at-6.51.25-PM.png 475w, wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-13-at-6.51.25-PM-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“My father’s brother was a brilliant man . . . We have very good genetics.”</p>
</div>
<p>If there is one person, who had unfettered access to the ideas and concepts of Nikola Tesla, it was engineer and nuclear physicist, John G. Trump. After the raid on Tesla’s apartment and subsequent investigation he stated, “Tesla’s thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character, but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.”<b style="font-weight: normal;"> </b>Was John G. Trump telling the truth when he publicly dismissed Tesla’s ideas? Or was he playing a multi-dimensional game of chess decades before his nephew Donald?</p>
<p>If knowledge is power, why would any man voluntarily give up the knowledge about a potential death ray that could “stop armies dead in their tracks”? In reference to Uncle John, President Trump said he would talk to him “about the power of weapons someday” and “that the destructive force of these weapons would be so massive, that it’s going to be a scary world.”</p>
<p>Is it possible President Trump was alluding to a future Space Force as far back as July, 2015? At a speech in South Carolina, a then candidate Donald J. Trump announced: “nuclear is powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought?” John G. Trump died in 1985 when he was 77. The question remains, did he pass on any secrets to his nephew?</p>
<h4>The Tesla Border Wall</h4>
<p>The inventions of Tesla are not limited to The Space Force. Tesla also had ideas for The Wall. In the Fall of 2017 the FBI released 64 pages to the public about Tesla. In a report titled, “NY 65-12290” a plan for a highly advanced border wall are revealed:</p>
<blockquote><p>TESLA’s only military invention was a method to which he once eluded but never [sic] fully described. This invention was a means whereby an impenetrable [sic] ‘wall of force’ can be erected around the United States’ borders which would render helpless any military attack. TESLA disclosed the existence of his plan in 1934 and stated he intended to present it to the Geneva Conference but seldom referred to it afterward.</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-188701" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Trump-guy-.jpg" alt="" width="570" height="414"><br>
Prior to hitting a home run Babe Ruth used to “call his shot” by pointing to the fences with his baseball bat. The creation of the Space Force is President Trump “calling his shot” in regards to space exploration and unprecedented human achievement. President Trump is dead serious about The Space Force, the power of which is beyond our current scope of technology.</p>
