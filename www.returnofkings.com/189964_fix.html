<p>Actress <a href="https://pagesix.com/tag/asia-argento/">Asia Argento</a> allegedly admitted she did have sex with a 17-year-old former co-star — but claimed he “jumped” her, according to explosive texts published Wednesday.</p>
<p>The texts, which <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/08/22/asia-argento-17-year-old-boy-in-bed-photo-sex-texts/">TMZ says</a> are between Argento and a friend, come a day after the 42-year-old actress <a href="https://pagesix.com/2018/08/21/asia-argento-denies-sexual-assault-says-payoff-was-anthony-bourdains-idea/">claimed she never had sex with former child actor Jimmy Bennett</a> but <strong>admitted her late boyfriend Anthony Bourdain agreed to pay him hush money.</strong></p>

<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is how young Jimmy Bennett was when Asia Argento worked with him.

<p>“I had sex with him it felt weird. I didn’t know he was a minor until the shakedown letter,” Argento allegedly wrote to her pal.</p>
<p>“The horny kid jumped me … It wasn’t raped but I was frozen. He was on top of me. After, he told me I had been his sexual fantasy since was 12.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/us/asia-argento-assault-jimmy-bennett.html">A bombshell New York Times report</a> published Sunday first alleged that Argento paid $380,000 to Bennett — who once played her son in a movie — after he accused her of raping him in her California hotel room when he was 17 and she was 37.</p>
<p>The age of consent in California is 18.</p>

<p>Argento finally responded Tuesday, saying Bourdain coughed up the cash because he feared negative press and because Bennett was broke, but said she never had “any sexual relationship” with the teen.</p>
<p>A photo published by TMZ appears to show Argento and Bennett topless in bed, but Argento allegedly claimed “It doesn’t mean s–t” in the text exchange.</p>
<p>“You can see my t–s,” she wrote. “That’s all.”</p>
<p>Argento, now 42, also allegedly texted her friend a letter she said Bennett gave her afterward.</p>
<p>“I love you with all my heart. So glad we met again and I’m so glad your in my life. Jimmy,” reads the note scrawled on Ritz-Carlton stationery.</p>
<p>Argento then claims Bennett sent “unsolicited nudes” to her for years afterward — until two weeks before his lawyers reached out demanding a payout, according to TMZ.</p>
<p>“I didn’t report because I always felt bad for this Hollywood failed child actor, a casualty of the machine, of his parents,” she allegedly texted.</p>
<p>“I have 80 pages on him by a PI that Anthony hired.”</p>

<p>The Italian actress became an icon of the #MeToo movement when she accused producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault last year.</p>
<p>Argento’s lawyer didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.</p>
