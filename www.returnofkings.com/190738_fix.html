<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>As you probably have heard in the news, earlier in August a Pennsylvania grand jury handed down a <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/pope-francis-silent-about-pennsylvania-catholic-church-child-abuse-by-priests?ref=scroll">1,356-page account of sexual abuse which involved around 1,000 kids and 300 priests during a period of approximately 70 years</a>. It is another pedophilia scandal within the Catholic Church that adds up to their collection of countless other ones reported in recent years.</p>
<p>The commie pope—while on his two-day visit to Ireland—begged for forgiveness again, just the way he did in Chile back in January of this year.</p>
<p>You can notice how quick and scathing the mainstream media is to denounce these recurring events, after all we know who owns the MSM and the (real) Church has a long, well-known history of “anti-semitism” and resistance against the tentacles of globalism. I wish the media had the same commitment to inform the existence of other pedophile rings full of high-ranking people as well.</p>

</div>
<p>Is the problem of the church’s innumerous sexual abuse allegations really pedophilia? To me there is a deeper explanation for it, and that explanation is: homosexualism. <a href="https://www.churchmilitant.com/news/article/pedophile-priests-typically-homosexual">81% of the alleged victims are male and three-fourths of them are post-pubescent</a>. As you guys are certainly aware of, the Church has a very big issue with homosexualism among its clergymen.</p>
<p>I have a theory for the high presence of gay men inside priesthood: until not long ago being gay was definitely not ok, homosexuals were not accepted as they are now, so they became priests.</p>
<p>The developed Western world of today encourages people to become gay, it applauds individuals for their gayness, but it wasn’t always like that. Now, try to imagine a closeted homosexual man living in the 50s, for example. What a better place to go than the Catholic seminary? People wouldn’t look you down, you wouldn’t have to get married, the place was filled with other young men (potential sexual partners) and that’s how the Church got corrupted by perverts.</p>
<h4>Pedophilia x Homosexualism</h4>
<p>One normie could argue “how homosexualism relates to pedophilia?” Any red-pilled person who has ever wondered what causes someone to become gay will notice that there is an undeniable link between pedophilia and homosexualism.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/21/milo-yiannopoulos-resigns-breitbart-pedophilia-comments">Let’s remember the occasion of Milo Yiannopolous’ resignation from Breitbart over comments which seemed to endorse sex between “younger men” and older men</a>. Something that is—as he pointed out—extremely common among gay men. A <a href="https://stream.org/yes-childhood-sexual-abuse-often-contribute-homosexuality/">2009 report</a> revealed that 74 percent <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Droid Serif',Georgia,'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 24px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">of bisexuals had been sexually abused as </span>children, I am pretty sure homosexuals follow the same numbers.</p>
<p>I won’t say homosexual behavior is exclusively caused by pedophilia because human (or animal) sexuality is a very complex topic which can certainly involve many variables. I just don’t buy that “born this way” hype, until this day not a single reliable proof of the existence of a gay gene or anything like it was discovered.</p>

</div>
<p>Pope Francis, a champion of the left-leaning agenda inside the Church, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/8/26/17783168/pope-francis-vigano-cover-up-accusation-sex-abuse">has been accused</a> of covering up former Cardinal McCarrick’s abuse allegations (one of the many cases in Pennsylvania). The accusations were made by Carlo Vigano, a former Vatican ambassador to the US, and if it proves to be true–I am positive it is—that should result in pope Francis’ resignation. As a traditionalist Catholic myself I would be delighted with such an event.</p>
<p>Francis has already been complacent with other pedos before. <a href="https://onepeterfive.com/where-does-pope-francis-really-stand-on-clerical-sex-abuse/">One good example</a> is the 2015 ‘Synod on the Family’ when the pope invited Godfried Danneels, a Belgium Cardinal convicted of covering up pedophiles in the 90s, to attend the meeting. Danneels is a hard-left priest that tries to push the Church ” liberal reformation” and admitted that he was part of a plot against (right-leaning) Pope Benedict and in favor of the election of leftie Francis.</p>

<p>To affirm that the Church’s gay/pedos are exclusively part of the left-wing priesthood would be too Manichean. I am sure there are tons of sick people who lean right also. But it can’t be denied that the liberals make up the vast majority of these issues involving sexual misconduct.</p>
<h4>“Religious progressives”</h4>
<p>For those who don’t know, the Catholic Church, just as any other political institution, is divided in factions that tend to be more liberal or orthodox. The liberation theology, for instance, is a movement created inside the Catholic Church (and some Protestant denominations) which aims to mix Christianity and Marxism.</p>
<p>Even if you are an agnostic don’t underestimate the influence they played in various regions such as Europe, Latin America and even New England. Brazilian Workers’ Party attributed their success to this movement and Unions.</p>
<p>Be wary of any religious leader that tries to push a liberalization of dogmas and traditions. Because all religions are intrinsically conservative according to their respective contexts, they establish doctrines that dictate sets of rules that must be followed properly in order to attain their objectives (whether is Salvation in Christianity or Nirvana in Buddhism). There are no (real) religions without their traditions.</p>
<p>Whenever you see liberal religious men doubt their characters. There is a good chance they don’t even bother with religion or spirituality, perhaps they are closeted atheist. What they do care about is the religious platform, which can offer various benefits such as large audiences, political influence, money and even sex.</p>

</div>
<p>Every time pedo priests’ cases pop up in the MSM, secular people are very quick to point fingers and show their moral superiority, but they “forget” the existence of secular institutions that are way more sexually perverted than the “gayish” modern Church, such as Hollywood, the political and corporate world.</p>
<h4>Real Church x Sissy Church</h4>
<p>It is also important to notice that the Church was emasculated, an emasculation that took place during the process of secularization and establishment of liberal democracies across the Western world (e.g. French Revolution).</p>
<p>The Church had to be softened, becoming an institution that barely resembles the once powerful and great Church of the Crusades or the Inquisitions. This same phenom of emasculation can also happen in other secular institutions too, <span style="display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #222222; cursor: text; font-family: Georgia,'Times New Roman','Bitstream Charter',Times,serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/27/17057580/transgender-soldier-military-trump-ban">the Military</a>, </span>mainstream Music, Politics, Sports and even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/us/boy-scouts-reversing-century-old-stance-will-allow-transgender-boys.html">Boys Scouts</a>. And it will only get worse as liberal-democratic globalism advances, so secular people: watch out!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/35557/walsh-how-ancient-church-dealt-deviant-priests-matt-walsh?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=062316-podcast&amp;utm_campaign=mattwalsh">St. Basil the Great, a 4th century bishop and Doctor of the Church, defended that gay/pedo priests should be publicly flogged</a>. That was the (real) Church, not this sissy catholicism created after the Second Vatican Council (a modernist reform imposed in the Church from 1962 to 1965). A lot of things got bad in the 60s.</p>
<p>The (real) Church has a very important and vigorous story in the construction of the West. Always being a target to the globalists and that breed who rules the world, a clear obstacle to their goals.</p>
<p>Examples are many: Gabriel García Moreno, Catholic Equatorian president, who made a terrific job in a Confessional Equator and was killed by the Freemasons; Saint José Sanchez del Rio, who was killed by Mexican secular, freemason and leftist government with the support of the US, for refusing to abbandon his faith.</p>
<h4>Inconvenient truths are ignored</h4>
<p>The media only goes after what is convenient to their narrative, don’t expect them to expose Hollywood pedos nor the obvious link between pedo priests and homosexualism. The left has already <a href="https://twitchy.com/brettt-3136/2017/06/17/salon-deleted-its-articles-defending-pedophilia-but-the-bbc-is-picking-up-the-slack/">pushed the normalization of pedophilia</a> many times and I didn’t see the indignation of the MSM.</p>
