<p>I started reading this site just over a month ago, and can report the following lifestyle changes.</p>
<h4>1. My priorities are clearer</h4>
<p>I suddenly feel I have the <strong>right</strong> to <strong>insist on</strong> prioritizing my own daily goals, over the goals other people want me to achieve.</p>
<h4>2. I Lift To Look Better And Get Stronger</h4>
<p>It’s OK to want to learn what my own abs look like. I <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8017/2-steps-to-effective-fat-loss">started Leangains</a>, dropped ten pounds of fat, gained three pounds of muscle. Eating lifting and feeling like a warrior, and I’ve never felt better in my life. Man eats meat.</p>
<h4>3. I started learning <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/4552/5-reasons-to-learn-krav-maga">Krav Maga</a>
</h4>
<p>Because a man should be able to defend himself and his <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/6329/the-harem-the-tribe-and-the-pride">pride</a>. This seems so obvious to me now, I wish I’d started years ago.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="../nmkravmaga.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/elbowstrike.jpg" width="428" height="304"></p>
<h4>4. Fatherhood now makes sense</h4>
<p>It’s clear I must teach my son how to approach the world of women, <strong>better equipped</strong> than I was. I bought three of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Roosh-V/e/B00649OS0O">Roosh’s books</a>, and my son will receive them as a gift when he comes of age.</p>
<h4>5. I understand women better</h4>
<p>I understand now why I was never “good” with women, why my older wife chose younger me, why our relationship evolved as it did, and how I can improve my current and future relationships with women by encouraging them to be feminine. Someone has to be the man, it might as well be me.</p>
<h4>6. I understand <em>men</em> better</h4>
<p>Every man I encounter can, and should, be considered by his beliefs about the sexes and his alpha or beta tendencies. Both frameworks make total sense to me. Once I realize whom I’m talking to, conversations take on a whole new meaning.</p>
<h4>7. I’m better with my clients</h4>
<p>The illogical and frustrating people I am forced to deal with, <strong>are as they are</strong>, independent of how I deal with them. That truth frees me to do my job of sharing knowledge and charging appropriately for my time, while concerning myself less with whether or not the student learned what I was trying to teach. It’s no longer part of my job to feel guilty every time a student refuses to learn.</p>

</div>
<h4>8. When a telemarketer calls, I hang up.</h4>
<p>Because I didn’t ask for that. I have the <strong>right</strong> to <strong>control my own time</strong>. I used to feel at least a twinge of guilt before hanging up before.</p>
<h4>9. I’m downright brutal in conversation now</h4>
<p>I don’t have time for your crap. If you don’t have facts to counter my argument, your opinion is irrelevant and the discussion is over.  I’ve noticed others suddenly work extra hard now to please me and garner my praise. Turns out more people respect a man who believes in what he says, and says it with conviction.</p>
<h4>10. My relationships are improving</h4>
<p>I now focus on setting clear and realistic expectations with others; I reward good behavior and punish bad behavior with my wife, and my son. My employees are much more straightforward. I am not<strong> passive agressive</strong>, because I have the <strong>right</strong> to believe, to feel, and to say what I want, and further, to <strong>insist on my needs</strong> rather than <strong>‘request.’ </strong>I’ve begun to <strong>value my own contributions</strong> to my relationships so much more now, that it only makes sense to <strong>expect</strong> reciprocity.</p>
<h4>Not Just Problems – Return Of Kings Offers Solutions</h4>
<p>It doesn’t even matter if you disagree with something you read here, or if every author is correct 100% of the time, or if someone writes just to inflame readers, or what the site creator’s motivations are. That someone created something this beautiful and true, is inspiring.</p>
<p>I’m not going to be a Casanova any time soon, and that’s not my intent – I’ll leave that to my son. Here I find a small army of forward thinking writers whom I enjoy reading.</p>
<p>I will contribute as long as I’m able. And read, and absorb, and join in, and contribute again, and learn with you all, and <strong>celebrate men, and the women we love.</strong></p>
<p>Roosh, Uncle, I tip my drink to you.</p>

<p><strong>Dear readers</strong>, what about you – do you have any stories of how your life has been changed by this journey?</p>
<p>Yes or no, I hope you will join me in contributing to the vital discussion of what it means to be a man.</p>
