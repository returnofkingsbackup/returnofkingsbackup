<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p>Serena Williams lost to Naomi Osaka at the 2018 US Open Championship match. What made headline news was the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/remysmidt/tennis-players-stunned-williams-us-open-final">meltdown of Serena</a> over a point and game violation for her behavior. Despite receiving multiple penalties, she kept yelling at the umpire, Carlos Ramos, demanding that he owed her an apology.</p>
<p>Player coaching has been an ongoing problem in tennis and during the match, there were instances where authorities caught her coach giving signals during points, which is a violation. There was nothing ‘unfair’ about giving her a warning for it. Serena just took too far by fighting back, bringing up irrelevant things like having a daughter, which had absolutely nothing to do with the situation. She kept saying ‘I didn’t get coaching,” and  “I have never cheated in my life!” She later made exaggerated accusations that escalated the situation.</p>
<blockquote><p>You stole a point from me. You’re a thief, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Williams demanded to speak with a higher authority, which is when Brian Earley, the referee, stepped in the address the situation. Serena began venting to the other lady, crying and whining. When her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, was interviewed by an ESPN reporter after the match, he even admitted to it, but then tried to justify it by saying that everybody does it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m honest, I was coaching. I mean, I don’t think she looked at me so that’s why she didn’t even think I was. But I was like 100 percent of the coaches on [sic] 100 percent of the matches.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coaching is fine when marketable players like Serena are involved, but when someone calls her out for it, suddenly, it becomes a gender issue. Ramos is actually one of the few respected umpires because he isn’t afraid to make tough calls on elite players which he has on Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and other rising players like Nick Kyrgios.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/uiBrForlj-k.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The odd thing about the video is that how come you can clearly hear everything Serena says yet not what Ramos or the referee, or anyone else was saying? Something just doesn’t sit right with this whole thing. I have heard that The Super Bowl was rigged in the past, and remember watching an interview in school with a man who was in prison for steroids state that the entire Olympics is a sham. Then I hear things like the UFC tells players to make fights last longer to make the audience feel like they got their money’s worth.</p>
<p>People like to bash Vince McMahon for the WWE being fake, but if you investigate enough, you’ll find that all sports is simply one big entertainment scheme where payoffs and sellouts can manipulate entire  matches. So when I see this outburst from Serena, and how the camera so perfectly catches a woman in the audience cheer her stupid behavior at around 9:30 in the video clip, it all seems like a setup to me.</p>
<p>It looks like orchestrated sports entertainment designed to sway sheeple to think a certain way. Call it crazy, but with how things are going on these days, you’d be crazy not to suspicious.</p>
<p>During the after match conference, Serena claimed that what was done to her was sexist and that a man would not have received such a penalty, but the fact of the matter is, she made the situation worse unnecessarily by letting her emotions get out of control and thus paid for it. Ramos did his job, and did it well despite the immense pressure on him from a wild yapping woman.</p>

<h3>Serena’s Bad Behavior</h3>
<p>The problem with Serena Williams is that she thinks she’s the queen of tennis and expects to be treated like royalty. She plays an act, but when things don’t go her way on court, her true colors come out.</p>
<p>Williams was <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/remysmidt/serena-williams-has-been-fined-17000-after-the-us-open-final?bfsource=relatedmanual">fined</a> $17,000($4,000 for the coaching warning, $3,000 for smashing her racket, and $10,000 for verbally abusing Carlos Ramos). Even though this situation involved a Black woman, a Spanish judge, and a Japanese winner, it’s still the White man’s fault. Serena has been getting away with it for a while and it’s about time he got what she deserved. In the past, she got penalized when an oriental linesman told the chair umpire that Serena threatened her.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/gNwc7o_0Sgg.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Serena said ‘Are you serious?’ when authority asked about the threat, denying it, however she later apologized for it…</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/ZJxIHCbZmBw.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>As you can see, Serena has a history of racquet abuse and aggressive behavior.</p>

<h3>Defenders of Serena</h3>
<p>Billie Jean King, a former player, made these statements on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1/2) Several things went very wrong during the @usopen Women’s Finals today. Coaching on every point should be allowed in tennis. It isn’t, and as a result, a player was penalized for the actions of her coach. This should not happen.</p>
<p>(2/2) When a woman is emotional, she’s “hysterical” and she’s penalized for it. When a man does the same, he’s “outspoken”; and there are no repercussions. Thank you, @serenawilliams, for calling out this double standard. More voices are needed to do the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, male stooges like James Blake, a former Black tennis player who went to Harvard during the high days of affirmative action, and washed-up has been players like Andy Roddick, bashed the umpire in their tweets.</p>
<p>Roddick himself has a track record of whining like a girl even before the match has begun…</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/tIEWxcOWUL4.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>John McEnroe was notoriously known for his anger bursts, but he received many fines and disqualifications. Other men have too, the media is just choosing not to show it.</p>
<h3>This is What Feminism Produces</h3>
<p>Why is Serena Williams playing at a tournament when she just had a baby? Why isn’t she focused on being a mother? What is the point of playing tennis at her age? What is she trying to prove? People don’t realize that a woman who recently gave birth still suffers the emotions of after pregnancy, and Serena’s case is a clear example of why women need to stop imitating men and instead be better women.</p>
<p>The real victim is Osaka, who earned her win with her talent, but got booed because of the meltdown of an immature 36-year-old woman. Serena usually intimidates her opponents by roaring like an animal, but that didn’t work on Osaka and so she resorted to what she normally does when she can’t beat better players: aggression and the blaming of others.</p>
