<span class="cb-itemprop" itemprop="reviewBody"><p><em>The following article was sponsored <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/global-seducer-quickie-podcast/id1346953754?mt=2">by Global Seducer</a>.</em></p>
<p>What does it take to succeed with women? It takes balls. That’s true. You need to have the balls to decide “enough! No more Mr. Nice Guy!” Have you already reached this point?</p>
<p>Come on. You already know what point I mean. Yes, the boiling point. You’ve been way too nice for way too long. You’ve paid the restaurant bill for way too many ungrateful women who ended up banging some other dude who didn’t pay shit. Do you really want to continue this game?</p>
<p>It’s time for a change. It’s time to become a man who naturally attracts beautiful women. Let’s cut through the chase. Success with women doesn’t come from being nice, buying her flowers, and doing what Cosmopolitan wants you to do.</p>
<p>It’s hard if you listen to the wrong advice but easy if you have the right daily guidance. That’s why I decided to start the Global Seducer Quickie Podcast. Why “Quickie?” Well, because every episode is between 10-20 minutes, which makes it easy to consume. Oh, and did I mention that…</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/global-seducer-quickie-podcast/id1346953754?mt=2"><strong>This is THE ONLY daily seduction podcast for men on iTunes.</strong></a></p>
<p>And it’s free!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-194010" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/09/global-seducer-itunes.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="416"></p>
<p>The danger: One of my podcast listeners told me that he almost crashed his car because he was enjoying my recent podcast episode so much that he stopped focusing on the street. But don’t worry. He’s okay. He even left an iTunes review for me… just like other satisfied listeners.</p>
<p><em>“Okay Sebastian, but why should I listen to the Global Seducer Quickie Podcast?”</em></p>
<p>Nope, not because of my irresistible German accent that makes Arnold Schwarzenegger sound like a native speaker. However, I talk about every dating, pickup, and seduction related topic on planet earth and I do my best to help you every single day, 365 days a year.</p>
<h3><strong>Develop Deep Self Confidence </strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-149914" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/01/girl-poolside.jpg" alt="" width="443" height="593"></p>
<p>Self-confidence is the key to success with women. And no, I’m not talking about the wishy-washy self-confidence that a lot of dating gurus sell you. I mean, come on. We both know that screaming “I’m the best PUA in the world” in the mirror won’t cut it. This bullshit doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Are you ready for the truth? Low self-confidence is never the problem. It’s just the effect.</p>
<p>The cause, the underlying problem, runs deeper. That’s why I introduce exercises and techniques in my podcast that help men like you to figure out the cause of their self-confidence issues. Eventually, this process leads to healing and to a new and more fulfilling path.</p>
<p>I promise to do everything in my power to support you on your journey to unshakable confidence.</p>
<h3><strong>Become a Man with Integrity </strong></h3>
<p>What does it mean to have integrity? It means that you do the things you want to do and say the things you want to say. But it also means to not do the things you don’t want to do. A man with integrity doesn’t agree with a woman even though he disagrees with her. Such a man doesn’t betray himself and his values. As a result, she doesn’t put him in the friend zone.</p>
<p>Integrity is the greatest aphrodisiac. Speak your truth, live your life on your own terms, and don’t give a fuck about what other people think of you. That’s what a man with integrity does. It would be an honor for me if my daily podcast episodes help you to become this man.</p>
<h3><strong>Train Your Body for Seduction Success</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-141342" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ukrainian_Girl_UAOutfit.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="393" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ukrainian_Girl_UAOutfit-100x65.jpg 100w, wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Ukrainian_Girl_UAOutfit-260x170.jpg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"></p>
<p>You’re a man. You’re a warrior. Yes, seduction skills and the right techniques are important. But in order to succeed with women, you have to step back and look at the big picture. Seduction is a holistic art. You might know all the techniques in the world, but if you’re too fat to get off the couch, you’ll fail.</p>
<p>“But Sebastian, pickup guru X, Y, and Z told me that my body doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>Newsflash: They lied to you to get your money.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the truth: Going to the gym, eating healthy, moving your body… these things are important. But that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Think about your body language. Think about the way you look at women, the way you smile, and the way you move your hands while talking to women.</p>
<p>All these things matter and I do my best to discuss them in my daily podcast.</p>
<h3><strong>Train Your Mind for Seduction Success</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine… you walk down the street. Suddenly, you see this incredibly beautiful girl. You want to talk to her. God, she’s gorgeous. She has long blonde hair, wears a tight skirt and the way her cheeks (not the one in her face) move from left to right…damn.</p>
<p>You want to approach her, but a thousand thoughts are popping up in your mind.</p>
<p><em>“How should I approach her?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What do I say next?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What if she doesn’t smile?”</em></p>
<p><em>“How do I connect with her?”</em></p>
<p><em>“How do I get her number and how do I get her on a date?”</em></p>
<p>You need the right information in the right format. That’s why I created the Global Seducer Quickie Podcast. You can listen to my incredibly annoying German accent while you relax, on your way to work, on your way to a date, and whenever your teacher, lecturer, or boss doesn’t look.</p>
<p>And don’t shit me. I know you have 10 minutes a day. Everybody does.</p>
<p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/global-seducer-quickie-podcast/id1346953754?mt=2"><strong>Why don’t you start listening to my podcast on iTunes right now?</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>Take Consistent Action and Don’t Give Up </strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-131795" src="wp-content/uploads/2017/10/cutegirl.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="351"></p>
<p>Can we make a deal? I don’t give up if you don’t give up. You have to promise me that you do everything in your power to succeed with women. You won’t give up after the tenth girl rejects you and after the fifth date ends with a hug and “it was really nice”. You approach the next girl because you know that overnight success is nothing but a myth.</p>
<p>You keep going. You keep pushing.</p>
<p><em>“Success is </em>not an accident<em>. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.” – Pele.</em></p>
<p>I give you my word: I will continue to publish a new podcast episode for you every day. Now I’m asking you: Will you start your journey towards success with women?</p>
<p>I want you to take action. I want it so bad that I decided to give you an exclusive gift. If you subscribe to my daily seduction podcast (remember, it’s free) and send me an email with the subject line “ROK Subscriber” at <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="633006010210170a020d23040f0c01020f100607160006114d000c0e">[email protected]</a>…</p>
