<h3>Game was banned from Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Kobo</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-194483" src="wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ben-garrison.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="415"></p>
<p>The big story of the week was <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/193470/amazon-has-banned-9-of-my-books-without-explanation">Amazon banning Game</a> along with eight of my other books. Barnes &amp; Noble and Kobo followed Amazon’s actions by banning my <em>entire</em> catalog of books, which includes <a href="https://www.rooshvstore.com/books/free-speech-isnt-free?utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=game&amp;utm_source=rok">Free Speech Isn’t Free</a>, a work that includes no graphic or sexual content. Here’s <a href="https://spectator.org/amazon-bans-roosh-how-love-became-hate/">a solid analysis from the Spectator</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are living in an Orwellian dystopia. Democrat members of Congress advocate harassment of their opponents, and Republican congressmen are targeted by assassins and GOP candidates are assaulted by knife-wielding lunatics, yet the so-called “mainstream” media insist that it is the Right, not the Left, which is dangerous. In this bizarre mirror-reverse world, atheists, homosexuals, violent anarchists and vehement man-hating feminists are free to say and do what they please, but a guy who tells other guys how to be successful with women is demonized like Emmanuel Goldstein in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Instead of free speech being suppressed by an all-powerful government, the enemies of freedom are gigantic multibillion-dollar Internet companies eager to appease swarming squadrons of social justice warriors (SJWs) who bombard them with complaints about alleged purveyors of “hate.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I also did interviews with <a href="https://www.infowars.com/banned-author-to-alex-jones-its-you-yesterday-and-me-today/">Alex Jones</a>, <a href="https://www.infowars.com/video-amazon-is-now-banning-offensive-books/">Paul Joseph Watson</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxckLLdRbys">JF Gariepy</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHb9_VvzsCs">Luke Rudkowski</a>. I appreciate everyone’s efforts in getting the word out for censorship that I believe was targeted for purely political reasons.</p>

<p>If you order from my store, you’ll have the opportunity to upgrade your purchase to include my entire catalog at huge savings, but only before Monday. <a href="https://www.rooshvstore.com/books/game?utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=game&amp;utm_source=rok">Click here to view the full description of Game at Roosh V Store</a>. I’m now working on ways to sell paperback editions directly to my readers. This may take a couple of months to work out.</p>
<p>I was really touched by the outpouring of support I received in the past week. I lost count how many messages I received from men who stated that they bought my book not because they want dating advice, but because they believe in what I’m doing. This encourages me to keep going. I may be down, but I’m not out.</p>
