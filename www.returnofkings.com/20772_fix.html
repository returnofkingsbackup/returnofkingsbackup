<p>Many of us here are familiar with the story of Mark Minter. A middle aged male with an apparent MRA leaning, Minter made a name for himself in the manosphere over the past year or so with a series of long, but enthralling posts about gender relations. Minter quickly gained a sizable following within the manosphere as his writings became more well known and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/319/who-is-mark-minter">more widely respected</a>.</p>
<p>It was this earned respect that made <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/14846/mark-minter-is-a-phony">Minter’s fall so surprising</a> and so spectacular. The man who had spent months damning American women and American marriage decided to <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/2013/07/26/did-commenter-kate-meet-her-fiance-at-chateau-heartiste/">shack up with a 34 year old single mother</a>.</p>
<p>Minter had failed to adhere to a principle considered vital to the conception of masculinity and manhood by many men in the manosphere and beyond: practice what you preach.</p>
<p>Granted, men are not perfect. It is only to be expected that some men err in their consistent adherence to this rule and write a few checks that their asses are not quite ready to cash in practice. Such imperfections can be forgiven to an extent, since all will prove guilty of them at some point in their life.</p>
<p>When you build large portions of your reputation on one principle, however, and then proceed to consciously go against it in an almost remarkably direct, indisputably contradictory fashion, you should not expect this kind of leniency.</p>
<p>Mark Minter may now have somewhat of a parallel in Hollywood.</p>

<p>I’m sure most of us here are familiar with Kanye West. He’s one of the most talented musicians alive today, with 6 Grammies and 5 platinum solo albums. His net worth is rumored to be in the $100 million range.</p>
<p>Kanye has made many hits, but “Gold Digger” stands out as one of the most prominent, its legacy carved deeper into modern pop culture lore and lexicon than most of his other hits.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Jamie Foxx]<br>
She take my money when I’m in need<br>
Yeah she’s a trifling friend indeed<br>
Oh she’s a gold digger way over town<br>
That digs on me</p>
<p>[Chorus:]<br>
(She gives me money)<br>
Now I ain’t sayin’ she a gold digger (when I’m in need)<br>
But she ain’t messin’ with no broke niggas<br>
(She gives me money)<br>
Now I ain’t sayin’ she a gold digger (when I’m in need)<br>
But she ain’t messin’ with no broke niggas<br>
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)<br>
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)<br>
Get down girl go head get down (I gotta leave)<br>
Get down girl gone head</p>
<p>[Verse 1:]<br>
Cutie the bomb<br>
Met her at a beauty salon<br>
With a baby Louis Vuitton<br>
Under her underarm<br>
She said I can tell you rock<br>
I can tell by your charm<br>
Far as girls you got a flock<br>
I can tell by your charm and your arm<br>
But I’m looking for the one<br>
Have you seen her?<br>
My psychic told me she have an ass like Serena<br>
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids<br>
And I gotta take all they bad ass to show-biz<br>
OK get your kids but then they got their friends<br>
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in<br>
We all went to Den and then I had to pay<br>
If you fucking with this girl then you better be paid<br>
You know why<br>
It take too much to touch her<br>
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta<br>
My best friend says she use to fuck with Usher<br>
I don’t care what none of yall say I still love her</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>[Verse 2:]<br>
18 years, 18 years<br>
She got one of your kids, got you for 18 years<br>
I know somebody paying child support for one of his kids<br>
His baby mamma’s car and crib is bigger than his<br>
You will see him on TV any given Sunday<br>
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai<br>
She was supposed to buy your shorty TYCO with your money<br>
She went to the doctor got lypo with your money<br>
She walking around looking like Michael with your money<br>
Should’ve got that insured got GEICO for your money, money, money<br>
If you ain’t no punk holla we want prenup<br>
WE WANT PRENUP! Yeah<br>
It’s something that you need to have<br>
‘Cause when she leave yo ass she gonna leave with half<br>
18 years, 18 years<br>
And on her 18th birthday he found out it wasn’t his</p>
<p>[Chorus]</p>

<p>[Verse 3:]<br>
Now I ain’t saying you’re a gold digger you got needs<br>
You don’t want your dude to smoke but he can’t buy weed<br>
You got out to eat and he can’t pay you all can’t leave<br>
There’s dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves<br>
But why you all washing watch him<br>
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun<br>
He got that ambition, baby, look in his eyes<br>
This week he mopping floors next week it’s the fries<br>
So, stick by his side<br>
I know this dude’s balling but yeah that’s nice<br>
And they gone keep calling and trying<br>
But you stay right girl<br>
But when you get on he leave your ass for a white girl</p>
<p>Get down girl go head get down<br>
Get down girl go head get down<br>
Get down girl go head get down<br>
Get down girl go head<br>
(lemme hear that back)</p>

<p>The message is pretty clear: avoid women who will bleed you dry financially. Protect yourself as a man. Sign pre-nups.</p>
<p>It all sounds fairly straightforward, right? Well, that’s what most people thought and it wasn’t long before “Gold Digger” became an iconic tune. Kanye’s message resonated with a lot of men.</p>
<p>But did it resonate with Kanye? Recent events have led me to believe that <a href="http://hollywoodlife.com/2013/10/22/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-prenup-engaged/">this isn’t quite the case</a>:</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/mdqAt1uDMko.html" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kanye is so overjoyed that Kim has agreed to be his wife, and the last thing on his mind right now is money. <strong>He ‘loves Kim too much’ to even think about asking his beautiful bride-to-be to sign a prenup!</strong></p>
<p>Kanye West has been waiting for this moment for so long and he doesn’t want to do anything to ruin his happiness with his new fiance, Kim Kardashian, 33. <strong>The Yeezus artist thinks it would be “tacky” and “awkward” to get a prenup — he just wants to celebrate their love instead</strong>, a source tells HollywoodLife.com.</p>
<p>“Kanye’s in love with Kim to the point of infatuation. It’s scary because <strong>the love is so powerful, Kanye doesn’t even want to have a prenup</strong>,” the source says. “He thinks it’s tacky and he doesn’t want to offend Kim or make anything seem awkward. <strong>He loves Kim too much for that</strong> to even cross his mind. He thinks of his money and his accomplishments and hers and he wants to share them with her — no strings attached.”</p>

<p>What were those lyrics again?</p>
<blockquote><p>Now I ain’t sayin’ she a gold digger (when I’m in need)<br>
But <strong>she ain’t messin’ with no broke niggas</strong></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://rollingout.com/entertainment/kim-kardashians-long-list-of-ex-lovers-and-boyfriends/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=kim-kardashians-long-list-of-ex-lovers-and-boyfriends">Yeah, sounds about right</a>…</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>If you ain’t no punk</strong> holla we want prenup<br>
WE WANT PRENUP! Yeah<br>
It’s something that you need to have</p></blockquote>
<p>So, is Kanye a punk now? By his own standards, I suppose the answer is yes.</p>

<p>Like Mark Minter, Kanye has revolted against his own stated standards of behavior. He has now embarked upon a mission to turn a hoe into a housewife, no doubt certain that he could be an exception to that general rule of failure. He’s decided to wife up a woman who is not only well beyond her prime, but whose entire name is built upon the foundation of a sex tape, a couple of failed marriages and a seemingly endless stream of boyfriends. And he’s decided to take this chance and dive in with no actual legal protection.</p>
<p>Good luck, Kanye. You’ll need it.</p>
