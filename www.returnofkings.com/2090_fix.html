<p>Much has been made in the manosphere of the ongoing rise of negative social indicators in the United States and the general societal decline that they seem to be predicting, particularly as they relate to gender relations. Many guys are worried sick about this, and rightfully so.</p>
<p>In the midst of this concern, however, I would like to present some information that could shed some more light on what may come of all this: we have actually been here before. In fact, there exists within our society a model for the outcome of all the ongoing negative trends we are seeing, a culture that has already felt the impact of those trends and suffered their consequences.</p>
<p>That model or “prototype” for our future is Black America.</p>
<p>The manosphere is a predominantly white corner of the net, but many of the problems discussed there are quite familiar to the relatively few blacks who frequent it. Almost every social problem guys in the manosphere cite as a growing concern within the general population has already played itself out within the Black American community.</p>
<p>Let us examine some of them individually.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1129_1350434802.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2144" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1129_1350434802.jpg" alt="" width="507" height="445" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1129_1350434802.jpg 634w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/1129_1350434802-300x263.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Concerned about growing obesity rates?</strong> Black American women already lead the nation here. <a href="http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/content.aspx?ID=6456">41% of those over 18 are obese</a>, compared to just under a quarter of White American women in the same age range. African-American women are 70% more likely to be obese than non-Hispanic white women.</p>
<p>You think white girls are getting fat? You’ve got a long way to go.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfi2ig9hh11qhxtqfo1_1280.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2148" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfi2ig9hh11qhxtqfo1_1280.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="490" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfi2ig9hh11qhxtqfo1_1280.jpg 612w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfi2ig9hh11qhxtqfo1_1280-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfi2ig9hh11qhxtqfo1_1280-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfi2ig9hh11qhxtqfo1_1280-50x50.jpg 50w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfi2ig9hh11qhxtqfo1_1280-186x186.jpg 186w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"></a></p>
<p><strong>2. Concerned about illegitimacy and rampant out of wedlock births?</strong> Black America has already been there and done that. The illegitimacy rate within that community has long been close to 70%. The nightmare scenarios being predicted in much of the manosphere regarding increased out of wedlock births and the complete breakdown of the family have already been played out there. Everyone else is <a href="http://www.aei.org/article/society-and-culture/citizenship/white-families-are-in-trouble-too/">playing catch-up</a>.</p>
<p>There is great concern about the potential for the young men of the future to grow up without a father in the picture. For most black men (including myself), this is simply routine.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfz2q9WiOY1rgyvero1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2146" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfz2q9WiOY1rgyvero1_500.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="456" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfz2q9WiOY1rgyvero1_500.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfz2q9WiOY1rgyvero1_500-295x300.jpg 295w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfz2q9WiOY1rgyvero1_500-50x50.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<p><strong>3. Concerned about the spread unchecked hypergamy is having on the dating market?</strong> Worried that it could lead to unrestrained bad-boy worship? Want to see where all of this is going?</p>
<p>Once again, look no further than black America. There may be no female more hypergamous than the average black american girl and, interestingly, there is <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/single-black-females/story?id=9395275#.UOOvCeSgYtE">no female with a lower rate of marriage</a>. The culture places a tremendous emphasis for men on the possession of traits matching those of urban masculine culture (read: “swag”, aggression, edgy appearance, etc).</p>
<p>In no culture are decent guys and more academically inclined males more marginalized and insulted than they are in Black American culture.</p>
<p>You think the sexual market value of the average white or asian nerd is low? Try being their black equivalent and having your entire culture essentially disown you and claim that <a href="http://educationnext.org/actingwhite/">your intellect makes you an insult to the culture/race</a>.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfpsawERAo1ro1dyeo2_500.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2147" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfpsawERAo1ro1dyeo2_500.png" alt="" width="450" height="464" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfpsawERAo1ro1dyeo2_500.png 500w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_mfpsawERAo1ro1dyeo2_500-291x300.png 291w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"></a></p>
<p>Bad-boy love and the extreme form of hypergamy that comes with it has ruled the black community for a couple of generations now. That nightmare is reality there.</p>
<p><strong>4. What happens when men in a certain culture are marginalized and their households become largely matriarchal?</strong></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m0nlg1itMN1qgs26do1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2151" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m0nlg1itMN1qgs26do1_500.jpg" alt="" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m0nlg1itMN1qgs26do1_500.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m0nlg1itMN1qgs26do1_500-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>

<p><em>Long Answer</em>: Men will have <a href="http://newsone.com/1510935/black-unemployment-rate/">high unemployment</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/28/sunday-review/how-prisoners-make-data-look-good.html?_r=0">incarceration rates</a>, and young boys will be prone to violence, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/education/article/Black-boys-see-bleak-future-at-school-4088520.php">academic reticence, and poor performance in school</a>. Nearly <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72">70% of undergraduate and graduate degrees will be earned by females</a>, while their men practically disappear from the higher echelons of the professional world and leave those women <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/12/20/black-men-for-black-women/a-definite-shortage-of-marriageable-black-men">without suitable mates</a>. These women will then proceed to ponder <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21532296">where all the good black men</a> went.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m9h8d443DH1qkdieno1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2159" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m9h8d443DH1qkdieno1_500.jpg" alt="" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m9h8d443DH1qkdieno1_500.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m9h8d443DH1qkdieno1_500-300x196.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>
<p>A culture hostile to academia will arise, excessive male posturing (see modern urban gang culture and the media that imitates it) will become the norm to compensate for the lack of productive pursuits among the men and the next generation will live out a cycle characterized by generally dysfunctional behavior.</p>

<p><em>Short Answer</em>: Black America will happen.</p>
<p><strong>5. Are you concerned about the rise of anti-male attitudes among women?</strong> You’d likely already know the end game were you a black American male. The manosphere’s archetype for the worst-case scenario of western womanhood is already normal in Black America.</p>
<p>“Backbreaker”, an African-American male who posts on the SoSuave.net forums, <a href="http://www.sosuave.net/forum/showpost.php?p=1974036&amp;postcount=25">broke this down quite well</a> (emphasis is mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The thing is, and this isn’t race bating or racism in the least bit, but because African Americans in the 70′s and 80′s were more single parent house holds than their Caucasian counterparts, most African American women today were raised not only without 2 parents around, but are fully convinced they don’t need a man. <strong>we kinda like have a 20 year head start on this whole feminism thing</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Black women have been telling black men they aren’t s**t, weren’t s**t and never will be S**T well before their Caucasian counterparts thought it was cool.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and well before any white woman decided to crow about “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/308135/">The End of Men</a>”.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/jaguarwright.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-2152" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/jaguarwright.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="419" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/jaguarwright.jpg 639w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/jaguarwright-300x281.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px"></a></p>
<p>Continuing (emphasis is again mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>“<strong>black women are the manosphere punch line /archetype of women who are too demanding and unrealistic and they all end up single</strong>. the only people who get got by black women are guys who want to get got. the only guy who was stupid enough to put a ring on my mom’s finger (who is the ultimate alpha widow) was the beta male who bought into the church hype.. and we all know better. and in 2 years she had rented her own apartment to get away from him. my mom has dated a school district superintendent, an engineer, a lawyer and a bishop of a church, and <strong>none of them were good enough for her independent ass lol</strong>“</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, the multiple nuclear bombs of societal decline that concern the manosphere have already went off in Black America. The end game is already on display.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always like this. Black Americans used to have <a href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=1261">more stable families and much lower illegitimacy rates (on par with or somewhat lower than those of modern white Americans)</a>. They had thinner women and lower crime rates. Their men were valued once, less marginalized and expendable than they are now considered to be and not as frequently incarcerated either.</p>
<p>In other words, there was a time in which Black America was a much closer parallel to the White America we know.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m2h4p0xi2f1qlz1xgo1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2153" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m2h4p0xi2f1qlz1xgo1_500.jpg" alt="" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m2h4p0xi2f1qlz1xgo1_500.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/tumblr_m2h4p0xi2f1qlz1xgo1_500-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>
<p>White Americans still hold on to pieces of this old reality, and now sound alarms throughout the manosphere of decline as more negative trends come closer and closer to home. Meanwhile, Black Americans have no room left for decline-the destruction is already complete.</p>
<p>If current trends are any indication, others may be soon to follow. Perhaps the numerous misfortunes that have befallen the Black American community could serve to warn others of what to do next and how to proceed into this more disconcerting future.</p>
