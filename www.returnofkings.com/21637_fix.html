<p>On November 13, I allowed publication of Tuthmosis’ article <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/21313/5-reasons-to-date-a-girl-with-an-eating-disorder">5 Reasons To Date A Girl With An Eating Disorder</a>. I did so because it contains value for men who want to date thin women in America, a country that is currently facing a devastating obesity epidemic, which we recently highlighted with <a title="Fat Shaming Week Was A Corpulent Success" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/19498/fat-shaming-week-was-a-corpulent-success">Fat Shaming Week</a>.</p>
<p>The article states several facts about women with eating disorders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A girl who spends inordinate mental and physical energy on her looks is rarely fat.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>You can go out to nice restaurants and order take-out with the confidence that your expense on her will be minimal.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>An eating disorder often translates into the direct opposite: a girl who’s modest, fragile, and vulnerable.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>They aren’t too many poor girls with eating disorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The delivery of ideas like these may make some people uncomfortable, but they are based on our experiences and views of the world. We speak the truths that politically correct outlets are too afraid to share because of sensitive mainstream readers who lose their composure at anything they disagree with.</p>
<h3>Eating disorders are bad</h3>
<p>I want to make it clear that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we at ROK are not promoting eating disorders</span>. These are devastating illnesses on those whom they afflict, and we wish sufferers are able to receive the treatment they need. It is unfortunate that sufferers continue to be stigmatized by society, so it surprises me that Tuthmosis’ article has been angrily received when it attempts to <em>reduce</em> stigma by encouraging our male readership to give women with anorexia and bulimia an opportunity for real intimacy. This is far better than merely giving patronizing e-support by outlets like <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/19/date-girl-eating-disorder_n_4303442.html">Huffington Post</a>.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<p>We are educating our masculine readers not to pass on eating disorder victims just because they have an illness, yet instead of receiving thanks, we’re receiving hate instead. If we all had cancer, and someone wrote an article titled “5 Reasons To Fornicate With A Man Who Has Cancer,” we would spread it far and wide to make fornicating with us a better proposition for women. We would <em>not</em> send death threats or calls for censorship like is happening to us now. I think a bit more graciousness is in order for our unorthodox method of outreach.</p>
<h3>The Tuthmosis case</h3>
<p>Upon closely reviewing Tuthmosis’ article, I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in it that endorses eating disorders or slanders those who have them. He has simply shared knowledge and insights that can aid single men in their pursuit of sexual happiness <em>without</em> hurting women. While some of his statements may be subjectively interpreted, we’re not a scientific journal, and so should not be judged in that manner.</p>
<p>Was Tuthmosis’ article offensive? Was it tasteless? Not to me and not to the bulk of our male readership. It is not our job as a men’s publication to ensure everything we write does not offend 7 billion human beings on this planet, so there is no legitimate reason to remove the article, and those who are calling for it to be removed should instead visit the graves of America’s great founders and speak into the ground about why they don’t believe in free speech simply because their feelings have been hurt by mere words. As a staunch believer in free speech, I will do all I can to make sure ROK contributors like Tuthmosis can share their opinions and experiences freely, especially when it does not advocate for violence or breaking the law.</p>
<p>Therefore, the article will stay and Tuthmosis will stay. We respect <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=returnofkings.com&amp;src=savs&amp;f=realtime">your freedom of expression</a>, even if they include death threats and calls for mutilation on our genitals, but I sincerely hope you can gather the strength to handle one article on the internet that you don’t like.
