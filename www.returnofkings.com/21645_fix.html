<p class="cb-author-bio">TLD is a young man in a world of men turned to sheep. He spends much of his time reading, thinking, and waking up minds that are willing to awake. He is occasionally called an asshole for his “insensitive” and/or “harsh” opinions. This does not bother him, because this is someone else’s opinion. He also likes steak.</p>

<p>When I first watched the short clip above, my reaction was a mix of laughter and annoyance (with an emphasis on annoyance). For those who do not know, Lululemon Athletica is the very successful Canadian company that pioneered and made fashionable the ever so wonderful yoga pants fad that has swept the west over the past decade. Any man, like myself, who has an insatiable lust for a well-rounded feminine posterior has this company to thank for putting a $100 price tag on a pair of spandex, thereby making it accessible to the more decadent ideals of the western female mind. Which brings me to the laughter: not only is the Founder and CEO of Lululemon some dude named “Chip”, he also sees it fit (no pun intended) to call out overweight women for wearing tight clothes on national television, albeit with tact. Bravo good sir! Standing strong for the manosphere! And then the inevitable occurs…</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/11/crazy.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-21682" alt="crazy" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/11/crazy.jpg" width="341" height="495"></a></p>
<h4>Truth Is Forbidden</h4>
<p>When asked why so many women have an issue with their Lululemon pants wearing thin, this CEO has the courage to speak the truth, and is immediately and universally chastised for it by the feminist hoard. This of course should not come as a surprise for readers of ROK, as we are all well aware of the hyper-feminist brainwashing that permeates the very fabric of Western culture. This news segment, however, struck a chord with me.</p>
<p>His answer to the question was delivered in a sincere, gentle, almost eloquent fashion. His answer is one based in physics (i.e., if you wear tight fitting athletic clothing and you happen to be overweight, inevitably you will wear out the fabric). End of story. If you have an issue with this, take it up with the Gods of Alchemy. Of course, physical reality be damned when it comes to the hyper sensitive expectations of feminized culture. How dare a man have the tenacity to suggest that women purchase clothing that fit them! And to be fair, Chip did not even go that far.</p>

<h4>Hypersensitivity/Irrationality is The Rule</h4>
<p>After reflecting on this video, I couldn’t help but visualize every single fat and/or morbidly obese girl I’ve ever seen carelessly making her way down the side walk in a pair of ATHLETIC yoga pants, seemingly oblivious to her effect on the world around her. I couldn’t help but see in my mind’s eye the overflowing rolls of fat, the over-stretched fabric barely clinging together as thunderous thighs of ignorance slowly tear it apart molecule by molecule.</p>

<p>What gets me most about this news segment, however, is just how universally accepted it is that this man should be reprehended for his suggestion that not every body type is right for yoga pants. On the surface, to any logically thinking adult, this would seem a no-brainer. If parts of your body are rubbing together due to your size, than this will deteriorate the fabric of clothing, especially if your clothing is made of a stretchy, spandex-like material. Makes sense right? Why is it then that the immediate reaction by the female interviewer, and the women they interview, is one of utter disgust? The answer: in the modern Western world, logic, common sense, and yes even physics are shunned and ignored if the truth that these avenues yield happens to even <em>slightly</em> offend the fragile female ego.</p>
<h4>How Did We Get Here?</h4>
<p>So who or what are we to blame for this irrational, emotional response that has, to the detriment of us all, become the norm? Western women. When every single thin girl under the Western sun tells her obese friend “you go girl” or that they “look hot in that sexy outfit,” they are reinforcing the ingrained dogma that no matter how unattractive a women appear, they must be told otherwise.</p>
<p>In reality, they are doing their overweight friend a disservice. By disingenuously flattering them, they are simply perpetuating her being okay with her weight problem,which down the road can and will lead to serious health issues, not to mention the inability to attract a quality mate. Beyond that, they are contributing to the continuing aesthetic decay of what was once a beautiful and virile western population. Combine this disingenuous female to female fawning with the unwritten law that the fragile egos of overweight women must be tip toed around, and you get this:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/11/81393414.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-21676" alt="81393414" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/11/81393414.jpg" width="480" height="300"></a></p>
<h4>Another Man Bites The Dust</h4>
<p>And this brings me back to my man Chip Wilson, no-bullshit CEO extraordinaire. Because of the enforced, ingrained social dogma that forces men to adhere to some blatantly illogical sensitivity standard, and to censor the truth should it be too “insulting”, his name and thus company will be tarnished by the liberal media. But fear not Chip, because intelligent males everywhere feel your pain, and we stand by you in your moment of tribulation. Though I will never purchase any of your overpriced yoga pants, I wholeheartedly support your right to rip off young, fit, bubble butt cuties everywhere.</p>
