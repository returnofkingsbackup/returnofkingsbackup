<p>Having talked to and observed many women of all kinds of ages, professions and walks of life, it became clear to me that one of the biggest turn-offs to them, if not the biggest one, is when the guy is being <em>boring</em>. Women seem to be able to overlook all kinds of other unattractive qualities. You may be bald, overweight, lacking in style or are not even that well off financially, and you could still date decent women if you have great personality, sense of humor and you can be a stimulating company to them. Even physically abusive guys get away with their temper and be forgiven if they are interesting,</p>
<p>However, if you are boring, there is nothing else about you that will make up for it, except if you just pay for sex straight up. That’s the reason there are so many  “nice” and “sweet” guys sit at home on Facebook or porn sites and jerk off. Not all of them, but many of them are just too damn boring.</p>
<p>In this article, I would like to first present one major but rarely mentioned reason why so many seemingly educated and accomplished guys appear boring to women. Then, I will suggest a simple way in which any such guy can become more interesting or at least less boring.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem: Many Guys Became Boring Because They Have Been Beta-fied<br>
</strong></p>
<p>You go out on a few dates with a few <a title="uptight women " href="http://www.practicalhappiness.com/uptight-women/" target="_blank">uptight girls</a> with serious entitlement issues, who think they are God’s gift. They can’t take the most mildly inappropriate joke or even get over the most mild disagreement, screaming “I can’t believe you just said that” as if you suggested that you endorse holocaust or slavery. You then start believing that all the girls are like that, and the only way to be attractive to any of them and the only chance to get laid is by being extremely careful and neutral when talking to them. You then start limiting your interactions, at least during the first few dates, to the most innocent topics, avoiding any kind of disagreements.</p>
<p>As a result, you go overboard in the political correctness department and you become way too careful when talking to girls. You steer away from any kind of dark humor or sarcasm. You are trying your best to be 100% positive about everything and you refrain from criticizing anything or anyone.</p>

</div>
<p>The over-the-top gentle and careful approach with girls, in turn, makes you appear extremely <a title="boring, beta yopes guys are not attractive to women" href="http://www.practicalhappiness.com/are-you-yopes/" target="_blank">boring and ultra-beta</a>, especially to the girls who have personality and a sense of humor. They want to spend time with a guy who has a backbone, can be both funny and stimulating, and can dish out dark humor and sarcasm.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/boring-date.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-23191" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/boring-date.jpg" alt="boring date" width="455" height="283"></a></p>
<p><strong>The Solution: Don’t Compromise Your Wit And Sense of Humor, and Don’t Settle For Uptight Girls<br>
</strong></p>
<p>The solution to this problem is two-fold. First, you must not start falling victim to your own past negative experiences with girls, and you must not start believing that all the women out there are uptight, high-maintenance bitches with no personality. They are not, no matter how many of them you met in the past. There are enough great women out there who you will have a great time meeting, having sex with and dating.  Therefore, you should not alter or suppress your behavior if you are naturally funny and sarcastic guy, because it will inevitably work on the type of girl that matches well with you. <a title="dark humor and sarcasm when flirting with girls" href="http://www.practicalhappiness.com/sarcasm-flirting-attraction/" target="_blank">Dark humor / sarcasm</a> is one of the most powerful flirting and seduction weapons you have been blessed with. And the smarter and more interesting the girl you are talking to is, the more intrigued and the more turned on (both physically and mentally) she will be by a man of sharp wit.</p>
<p>The fact that your behavior and personality are off-putting to some girls is actually <em>good</em> news, because it saves you so much time by pushing away the princesses and the ice queens that you want to avoid anyway.  Even if your behavior pushes away a few hot girls that you would love to bang, it gives you more time to pursue the girls who are both hot and great to be around. There aren’t that many girls out there whose inside matches their sexy outside, but they are out there.</p>
