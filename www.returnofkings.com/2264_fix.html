<p>A lot of guys have visited Ukraine and are telling their story. Here are some highlights from the forum…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-10553.html">Ukrainian women shit tests</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you talk to ukrainian girls you will inevitably come across of some of the common shit tests they use.I will present some of them and the answers usually given.</p>
<p>1.Why are you in Ukraine?</p>
<p>This test implies:Are you in Ukraine to hunt girls?If you answer I came to get girls you are immediately disqualified.If you answer I am a professional searching for business opportunities,interested in buying real estate,trying to open a shop or franchise etc you are in to be considered a liar.So carefully choose one reason why you are in Ukraine.How you justify your prsence.Tourist can mean sex tourist for them especially if you happen to be in a city flood by sex tourists or in a city with absolutely no tourist attraction.</p>
<p>2.How long will you stay in Ukraine?</p>
<p>If you answer I came for a week she may decide you are not material for LTR.If you answer I came to stay for long(student etc) she will suspect you are a liar.So you have to think of a clear answer before to this question.From my experience it is usually better to tell the truth but promise to come back soon to show that you are a frequent traveller.If she asks why do you come here often say that you have visited most European countries and Ukraine is your favourite you like the architecture and nature.Maybe the food as well.</p>
<p>3.Are girls not beautiful in your country?Why do you want ukrainian girl?</p>
<p>If you answer girls in my country suck you may appear as a sociopath or low value who cannot get a decent gf in his country.Or you may appear that you have high selection criteria so she is likely to be excluded as well.Or that you have a problem in character or a secret disadvantage that puts off girls.If you answer girls in my coutry are good she will ask then why do you not have a wife or girlfriend.This is another crucial question.</p>
<p>4.Why do you not have a girlfriend?Why are you not married?</p>
<p>This means what is your story?Are you not eligible to get a wife in your country or are you irresponsible?Or do you have some kind of defect? The answer is sth along the lines of unluckiness I did not happen to meet sb special so she will question whether you are social and cannot find girls through social circles.So be prepared guys.Have an answer beforehand for everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> I really dont know what people expect from the Ukraine either. Like most FSU countries, its only now starting to drag itself out of the dirt. The people may not look it, but the vast majority are actually quite poor by western standards and life is a daily struggle for most of them. They may look first world, but they are far from it.</p>
<p>The women themselves dont have time to waste either. They are over the hill at 25 and if they are unmarried as they move into their late 20’s they are really in quite a bit bit of trouble. Its over if they are in their 30’s for the most part. Now when they struggle like they do, it means nothing more than financial instability and loneliness for them as they get older. Throw into the mix a culture that believes and values traditional gender roles, and yes, the women are serious. They dont have time to waste on men who are not potential husbands. They dont have any safety nets and their safety net is their family and their husband.</p>

</div>
<p>This is why I keep saying to everyone that they need to get their stories straight and lie like absolute motherfuckers to them if its purely notch count they are after. Prepare properly and you will have a good time. Go there without doing your homework, acting like a tight arsed backpacker or thinking the women are all going to be DTF just because they enjoy sex is only going to lead to frustration.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-15793-post-266133.html#pid266133">Bulgaria vs Ukraine vs Hungary vs Poland</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ukraine is a different planet from anything else I’ve experienced, hardly anyone speaks english so you will need to brush up on your russian if you stay in the west, or your ukrainian if you go to the east [editor note: he has this reversed]. Kiev has a great metro system, marshrutkas are cheap and regular. Taxis suck ass, be prepared to haggle.</p>
<p>The girls are feminine and have great bodies. The Quality of the girls in Kiev seemed to be on some queer polar bell curve, they were either slavic with hairy faces or model good looking. Learn russian, I’m not kidding. Go see the burried monks, it’s a unesco world heritage site. The accomadation was not as cheap as I’d hoped in the Ukraine, and there isn’t really any set strip which was a pain. get a room near kreschatik and you should be alright.</p>
<p>There are plenty of back packers in the Ukraine so you can always pick up western tourists if you get bored of insanely pretty ukranian girls. Expect alot of dishonesty, bullshit, and outlight lies from the local guys. They are absolute scumbags, everyone is trying to rip you off. It’s a weird sensation. On the plus side they all look like crap, so you should definitely be better dressed, built, looking, and have tighter game than the locals, but fo you can’t speak Russian passably I would still give them the edge.</p>
<p>I didn’t get my Ukraine flag in Kiev, though did sleep with a back packer. The friends I made in my hostel said the girls were very mercenary, that they would sleep with you, but they needed to be taken out alot, so that would be your dollars working for you.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-6408-post-89480.html#pid89480">Ukraine – With Love</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think everyone’s experience in Ukraine has been pretty similar:</p>
<p>– Hottest girls in the world<br>
– Nightlife is so-so<br>
– Traditional culture, social circle oriented<br>
– Have connections or at least pipeline before you get there.<br>
– No one speaks English. The name of the game is “find the English speaker”<br>
– Make sure you spend more than a week there, because you’ll need it.</p>
<p>The guys who did well spent 3-6 weeks there, had social contacts, and found English-speakers. Guys who did not do well there were only there for a week and spent their time cold approaching girls who spoke no English.</p>

<p>There’s also the 27-page <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-11338.html">Industrial Shithole thread</a> which I updated while I was in Ukraine.</p>
