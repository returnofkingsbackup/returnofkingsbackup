<p>Why would anyone <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/15196/15-language-learning-tips-for-self-study">learn a language</a>? Usually we wish to improve ourselves, develop an understanding of a foreign culture and, often most of all, communicate with beautiful women who would otherwise be inaccessible to us. If you’re planning to take a trip or live abroad, as part of your preparation you should find a way to combine language study with learning about the girls in your new locale.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://www.italki.com/">iTalki</a>, a website that connects you to like-minded language students across the world. You can pay reasonable rates for private studies over Skype, write journal entries, and send messages to other students. However, iTalki really shines because of its search tool, which includes pictures of your potential language partners (girls, in this case), whether they are a native speaker, their skill level in your language, and a filter for city and country.</p>
<p>Pipelining is an increasingly important aspect of international travel. Whereas before most traveling players would dropping into a remote area and begin building contacts, the westernization of foreign countries ensures girls have exponentially more male contacts hitting them up on their iPhones. A numbers game is necessary for building both a prospect base and a social circle prior to your arrival.</p>
<p>Unlike OKCupid, where you are immediately put in a position of begging for dates as a confused foreigner, iTalki is a value exchange — you meet cute girls and help them with their English, while they help you with your French, Spanish, Russian, whatever.</p>
<p>Here are the two best reasons to work Italki into your foreign game routine:</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<h4>1. It offers value</h4>
<p>Even if you’re a clod, you’re likely a native English speaker and an American. Though that alone rarely gets you respect in the clubs in Helsinki or Buenos Aires, it projects value in this situation because many people wish to learn English and practice speaking with Americans. This type of sniper-game rewards the erudite player who is looking to improve himself in the process of finding new prospects, and helps meet women who are trying to do the same.</p>
<h4>2. Multitasking</h4>
<p>If you go to the bar, drop time and cash on a night out, and go home discouraged after getting blown out in your few approaches, what have you really accomplished? These growing pains are necessary evils for building the toolbox of your game, but improving your skills doesn’t always require an outlay of time and monetary for zero guaranteed value. Talking to cute girls on this website allows you to devote your time to two things at once, both of which synergize to make the other better. Even if your game is a rebuffed, you have still better equipped yourself for a trip or living abroad.</p>
<p>Here are the first few girls that came up with a search of English-studiers in Wroclaw, Poland and the Ukraine:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Not bad. iTalki helps you get better at actual communication, talk to cute girls, and get the local flavor before you drop into a completely new environment. What could be better motivation to keep at your language studies?</p>
