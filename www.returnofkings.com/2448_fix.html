<p>To learn about the alpha male, one does not need to look any further than today’s professional athletes. Athletes are the kings of the world with money, women, and fame. They are the modern Achilles, gods of the new age, and the ultimate alphas.</p>
<p>There was a recent debacle regarding Dwight Howard and Kobe Bryant in regards to the Lakers failing season, which brought up a discussion on being an alpha, and the butting of heads. Both men respectively shared their own opinions, which I believe gives a lot of insight to the general populace about what it really means to be an alpha.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakers-Kobe-Vs-Dwight-Fight-Picture-DivaWhispers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2654" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakers-Kobe-Vs-Dwight-Fight-Picture-DivaWhispers-300x225.jpg" alt="" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakers-Kobe-Vs-Dwight-Fight-Picture-DivaWhispers-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Lakers-Kobe-Vs-Dwight-Fight-Picture-DivaWhispers.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>In an attempt to compare the current situation in Los Angeles, Kobe was questioned by <a href="http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/nba/story/_/id/8817247/dwight-howard-says-los-angeles-lakers-play-each-other">ESPN</a> about the championship team with himself and Shaq.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That just wasn’t going to last,” he said, laughing. “You have too many alpha males. What do you think would happen if you put Jordan with Wilt? It’s just not going to happen.”</p></blockquote>
<p>However , success in that situation did still happen. The Lakers won three championships during that period. So how did they do it?</p>
<blockquote><p>“One of them has to sacrifice. I sacrificed quite a bit with individual numbers and MVPs and NBA Finals and all this other stuff.”</p></blockquote>
<p>How does this apply to regular, everyday people? Simple. It’s the same situation as when you go out. There is always an alpha male around. Both alpha’s can have success with the women they are near, but there has to be some sort of respect and boundary limitation to allow both of them to run their game. The same goes for running wingman game with two alphas. As long as both men are willing to accept that the more attractive of two women is only going to pick one of them, they can still both have a successful night.</p>

<p>Dwight also included some great insight on what it is to carry yourself as an alpha. This is a concept betas, especially those posing as alphas, usually don’t understand.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you’re an alpha male, you don’t have to always show that you’re the alpha male,” he said. “Just be who you are. You come in the room, people know you’re there.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But how else are you supposed to assert your dominance and make sure every woman knows you are an alpha?</p>
<blockquote><p>“My presence is felt every day, and I don’t have to come here and growl and snarl at people. I don’t have to do all that.”</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/VDBh9ZWjI0M%3Frel=0.html" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>You shouldn’t be trying to run game by talking about how great you are, what you do, and what you own. The focus should be on doing whatever you need to do to leave with that girl, all while letting your presence reflect who you are. Alphas assert dominance through presence. Betas on the other hand attempt it through action.</p>
<p>Dwight basically sums up the key point of being an alpha with this last quote.</p>
<blockquote><p>“That’s who I am. I’ve been an alpha male my whole life, but I don’t go pissing everywhere to show people that I’m an alpha male. I just need to be who I am.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What Dwight is really saying is, as an alpha you don’t need to be a dick or brag about who you are or how great you are. As an alpha that should be already known, or should be portrayed through a reflection of yourself through interaction. It’s like the old writing phrase goes, “show, don’t tell.” And that is how you should be running game; by showing, not telling.</p>
<p>So what does this really have to do with athletes? Simple. Athletes are the top dogs in the word. Biggest, strongest, fastest, and sometimes handsomest individuals. They have money, power, and the women. And yet, despite being at the very top, their idea of being an alpha isn’t any different than what it is to be an alpha in the local setting. In the end, it’s all the same concept.</p>
