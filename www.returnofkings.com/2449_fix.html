<p class="cb-author-bio">Edward was a weekly contributor at Return of Kings until he passed away unexpectedly after being crushed to death under the weight of his own massive ego. Tall, devastatingly handsome, witty, and successful; the poor lad just couldn’t handle the supreme awesomeness of his own being. May he rest in peace.</p>

<p>I really enjoy writing here at ROK. The readers are intelligent, and the short format allows for a quick dissemination of brutal truth without the tawdry and oh-so-tiresome task of qualifying every single statement in order to preempt the inevitable <a href="http://bronanthebarbarian.com/2012/11/08/fly-fresh-and-barbaric-presents-manospambots/" target="_blank">bot comments</a> from those with the reading comprehension of an empty beer can.</p>
<p>If I had a dollar for every “mean, misogynistic and short-sided” post I’ve written down through the years while making extra desk space for a coloring book and the 6 year old girl who stole my heart, I’d be a wealthy man. Her mom is a fine woman too, and I’m glad to have her around when she’s allegedly between boyfriends.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that the world is filled with fine women, and any man committed to staying unmarried and not allowing emotional tomfoolery to inhabit his dome will often find his experience with the lady folk to be a rather pleasing one. Yeah, even the party girls with high notch counts. If you’re not going to marry her, it really shouldn’t matter as long as the two of you get along.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, many of these sufficient women become worthless. They start out as decent specimens, but somehow manage to find themselves on <a href="http://xxxchronicles.wordpress.com/2013/01/03/i-beat-tucker-max/" target="_blank">the red pill man’s pump-and-dump list</a>. This is a bittersweet topic for me, because while I enjoy a random romp with girls who have managed to concentrate all of their worth between their legs, I’m also well aware of the many added benefits of girlfriending up a good one.</p>
<p>The way women become worthless is simple. It’s the SMP version of whats knows in the business world as the Peter Principle.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Peter Principle is a belief that, in an organization where promotion is based on achievement, success, and merit, that organization’s members will eventually be promoted beyond their level of ability. The principle is commonly phrased, “Employees tend to rise to their level of incompetence.”</p></blockquote>
<p>A pretty girl posts a sexy pic on facebook and you click like.</p>
<p>You just promoted her.</p>

<p>The same girl goes to the gym, and a dozen guys <a href="http://bangsomechicks.com/meet-girls-at-the-gym-pua-styl/" target="_blank">stare at her</a> like hungry wolves.</p>
<p>Promoted again.</p>
<p>Everyone in her family and social circle sees her HB7 and raises her three points.</p>
<p>Promotion!</p>
<p>Everything that comes out of her pretty little mouth is super relevant and interesting to the guys who want to bang her.</p>
<p>Promoted again.</p>
<p>Her beta orbiters trip over themselves trying to please her just for the satisfaction of being near her.</p>
<p>Promotion!</p>
<p>The list goes on and on, but you get the idea. From the day she’s born until the day she slams into the wall in her mid-30s, she just keeps being promoted until she reaches her level of incompetence. When the day comes that she can’t live up to the position she’s trying to fill – most awesome, sexy and unique thing everrrrr – she becomes a worthless self-centered bore who ends up in my phone as “Blonde HB7 Tiny Boobs Wrist Tattoo.”</p>
<p>I hate to do it, but I’m going to have to pin this one on men. We create these monsters by promoting otherwise good women far above their grade. If you’re doing this, I respectfully ask you to stop. Though the female ego is certainly complicit in this scenario, she can’t promote herself. It would be unwise to point a finger at feminism or a society that promotes girl power because her ego is just a self-written performance report. It takes a man to review the report and agree to promote her.</p>
<p>Slamming into the wall is a hilarious version of downsizing that sends the old, fat or ugly ones to the feminist welfare line. But it doesn’t have to be that way. I encourage men everywhere to cultivate a more solvent and manageable SMP by knocking off the beta orbiting, white knighting, and supplication that keeps promoting these women to positions they cannot handle. It’s rather unbecoming, and the shaming language from those being ushered out of relevance by red pill security guards is starting to get on my nerves.</p>
