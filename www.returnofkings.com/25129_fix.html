<p>It was really hard to narrow down the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/archives">861 posts</a> we published in 2013 to only 20, but it has been attempted. Here are what I believe the most influential and noteworthy contributions from 2013 in random order:</p>
<p><strong>1. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/2090/how-black-america-has-predicted-our-future">How Black America Has Predicted Our Future</a>.</strong> “Almost every social problem guys in the manosphere cite as a growing concern within the general population has already played itself out within the Black American community.”</p>
<p><strong>2. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/4658/dont-believe-the-lies-about-foreign-brides">Don’t Believe The Lies About Foreign Brides</a>.</strong> “So here we have average looking guys with moderate incomes and no ability with women who are still able not only marry hotter women than they would get at home, they are younger, more feminine and traditional too. They are landing far better women than they could if they stuck it out at home.”</p>
<p><strong>3. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/7765/how-young-women-promote-the-hookup-culture">How Young Women Promote The Hookup Culture</a>.</strong> “…how could a movement that seems to have played such a large role in encouraging young women to view the maintenance of meaningful relationships with men as hindrances to their future and “betrayals” of their femininity be considered in any way anti-male?”</p>
<p><strong>4. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/9932/the-15-magical-years-of-womanhood">The 15 Magical Years Of Womanhood</a>.</strong> “Despite minor adaptations to current realities, and individual variance, the arc of a woman’s beauty—and, by extension, power—has remained largely unchanged for generations.”</p>
<p><strong>5. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/3405/why-modern-dating-is-like-illegal-alaskan-halibut-fishing">Why Modern Dating Is Like Illegal Alaskan Halibut Fishing</a>.</strong> “Ironically, it’s the liberated woman who most rewards the sexually aggressive man – a man who fails to ‘seize the day’ will get left in the dust. She calls pickup artists ‘creepy,’ and then succumbs to his charm.”</p>
<p><strong>6. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/7877/the-mens-rights-movement-is-no-place-for-men">The Men’s Rights Movement Is No Place For Men</a>.</strong> “As utopians, MRAs don’t much care about any social institution for its own traditional role, but only insofar as it promotes ‘gender equality.’ Its goal is to remake every institution in society until androgyny of the sexes is attained and expected, and the ‘oppression’ of men has ceased. ”</p>
<p><strong>7. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/12436/the-10-slut-commandments">The 10 Slut Commandments</a>.</strong> “I didn’t create sluts and I would prefer that girls not spread their legs so easily, but guess what? Sluts are here to stay and they’re only going to get sluttier, so sit back, relax and let em ride your cock.”</p>
<p><strong>8. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/15487/the-western-male-is-the-reason-why-his-women-suck">The Western Male Is The Reason Why His Women Suck</a>.</strong> “When men relinquish their power over women, women will always take advantage of them. And after all, why shouldn’t they? Women merely take advantage of what is offered to them. If some man was sacrificing his life for your benefit, wouldn’t you accept his patronage?”</p>
<p><strong>9. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/16837/24-signs-shes-a-slut">24 Signs She’s A Slut</a>.</strong> “Whether you use them to get laid more reliably, or to avoid wifeing up the town bike, these cues should be on every man’s slut radar.”</p>
<p><strong>10. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/17249/how-to-defeat-new-york-city-media-liberals">How To Defeat New York City Media Liberals</a>.</strong> “The weakness lies in the original writer of the hit piece. Once the story goes viral, she is often forgotten, but it’s her where the counterattack can be successfully executed.”</p>

<p><strong>11. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/19498/fat-shaming-week-was-a-corpulent-success">Fat Shaming Week Was A Corpulent Success</a>.</strong> “I ask you, dear reader, what outlet has advanced fat shaming as much as we have? We promised you a buffet of fat shaming and I think we delivered. Most importantly, we’re still here.”</p>
<p><strong>12. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/19980/say-hello-to-the-new-definition-of-rape">Say Hello To The New Definition Of Rape</a>.</strong> “For every one of these false accusers that we catch, how many more did we miss? Feminists will continue to say this is a “small” problem, but men know very well that hooking up with the wrong girl can send them a world of trouble.”</p>
<p><strong>13. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/18694/paternity-fraud-is-worse-than-rape">Paternity Fraud Is Worse Than Rape</a>.</strong> “It must be nice for women to have so much support from the law with rape even when they are making up stories. Unfortunately, men are not afforded anywhere near the same support from the law in matters of paternity fraud.”</p>
<p><strong>14. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/21313/5-reasons-to-date-a-girl-with-an-eating-disorder">5 Reasons To Date A Girl With An Eating Disorder</a>.</strong> “In a world where the “retail price” on the typical Western woman continues to skyrocket—while their quality continues its precipitous decline—there are some real gems to be found in the bargain bin.”</p>
<p><strong>15. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/21177/20-things-women-do-that-should-be-shamed-not-celebrated">20 Things Women Do That Should Be Shamed, Not Celebrated</a>.</strong> “Rather than honoring the commitment she made to the love of her life (at the time) in front of who knows how many friends and family at their (likely) over the top extravagant wedding, women are instead celebrated for getting divorced because they’re, “not haaaapy.””</p>
<p><strong>16. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/21805/act-as-if-every-girl-is-a-slut">Act As If Every Girl Were A Slut</a>.</strong> “It’s a tactical assumption, something that you assume to be true to improve your strategy, even if you think it will be false most of the time.”</p>
<p><strong>17. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/15538/should-a-wise-man-get-married">Should A Wise Man Get Married</a>?</strong> “For Scala, a “wise man” is he who “diligently pursues peace of mind and tranquility.”  Such a man will pursue actions that tend to increase his peace and tranquility, since any other course would by definition be against his interests.  Since wives, according to the philosopher Epicurus,  are “on the borderline between good and bad,” the wise man would avoid marriage as an unacceptable risk. ”</p>
<p><strong>18. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/22358/10-reasons-why-foreign-women-are-better-than-american-women">10 Reasons Why Foreign Women Are Better Than American Women</a>.</strong> “Let’s face it—American women are pretty screwed up as a whole. They are emotionally unstable, mentally unstable, and suffer from delusions and are out of touch with reality. An American woman is living in her own movie, with herself as the star.”</p>
<p><strong>19. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/2710/8-essential-rules-to-surviving-the-workplace">8 Essential Rules To Surviving The Workplace</a>.</strong> “I have learned the hard way several times that I absolutely cannot share personal details of any kind at work. I actually came close to getting fired my second year out of college simply for giving a watered down PG-13 version of a rather tame weekend at spring break.”</p>
<p><strong>20. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/17525/controlling-your-womans-diet">How To Control Your Woman’s Diet</a>.</strong> “Next time you are in the vicinity of your girl and her friends, start a conversation with one of her inner circle about some trendy health food (I find <em>Goji Berries</em> often works) and end the interaction with “And they’re really low in fat too!…..but (Girlfriend’s name) would know nothing about that!””</p>
