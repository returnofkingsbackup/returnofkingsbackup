<p>It was a year ago during my last semester at college.  I had a cute, bubbly girl over at my apartment for dinner.  We had been on a date the week before and had kissed lightly in the car as I dropped her off.  I had planned to make my great grandmother’s spaghetti sauce recipe, hoping I’d impress her enough to charm my way into her pants.  As I stood near my kitchen stove stirring the sauce, she dropped a bomb in my face.</p>
<p>“We’re not having sex tonight, so don’t even try.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, I didn’t end up scoring with that girl one year ago.  I got her into the bedroom by playing guitar (I wasn’t a total moron), but was too much of a coward to escalate the interaction further.  I rationalized in my own mind that it was too early to push for sex, and that she was a nice girl who “wasn’t like that.”  She studied abroad in Australia for most of 2013 – and I’ll bet she racked up plenty of notches during the year.  Frustrated with my lack of success, I turned to Google.</p>
<p>I explicitly remember typing, “What to do when a girl says we’re not having sex,” into my search bar.  All of a sudden, the world was swung wide open to me.  I stumbled across blogs like Roissy and Roosh, and didn’t move from my computer chair for probably the next five hours as all the explanations for my lack of success with girls were explained to me in beautiful, concise words.</p>
<p>Little did I know at the time, but these websites that promoted what I later found out was the “Red Pill Belief” would completely change my life around.  Thankfully, the knowledge I gained was far more than the ability to simply put my dick into more girls.  It changed my life and provided me explanations for my struggles in many facets of life.  It is difficult to write things like this and admit how much I struggled and failed prior to this, but I couldn’t be more grateful.  It has taught me to be a better man and has allowed me to lay a path down that will bring me the most happiness.</p>
<p>Seeing as this is my first post at Return Of Kings for the calendar year, I thought it would be appropriate to recap how far I’ve come in my one year since the doors were swung open by swallowing the red pill.</p>
<h3>Girls</h3>
<p>This is the most obvious one, and likely the reason that most guys stumble across the red pill.</p>
<p>When I first found red pill sites, I was 21 years old.  I had really only been with one girl my entire life.  I had no idea how attraction worked or no real knowledge as how to understand females.  I was fortunately not the awkward guy learning pickup – I had the social skills, but not the <em>attraction</em> part of it.  The knowledge contained within sites like Return Of Kings teaches you <em>functional skills</em> with women.  It teaches you how to build yourself into a better man so that women are naturally going to gravitate towards you.  Knowing all of the lines, negs, and LMR tactics in the world won’t necessarily do you a lot of good without the inner frame that you are worthy of attracting beautiful women.</p>
<p>Through the red pill, I learned that if I built my life in the right way, I’m more than worthy of having a beautiful woman, or many beautiful women, in my life.</p>

<h3>Fitness</h3>
<p>Since dropping 85 pounds in high school, I’ve always been a bit of a fitness nut.  I raced endurance sports in college such as <a title="How To Prepare For Your First Triathlon" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/17798/how-to-prepare-for-your-first-triathlon">triathlon</a>.  I lifted weights at the gym 3-4 times a week.  However, I suspect my “workout plan” was what many guys who aren’t getting results are doing.  I’d walk into the gym, think of a few different exercises, try to remember the last time I’d done them, and then go perform them.  3 sets of 10, barely getting heavier with the weight, always fearing I’d throw a shoulder out of socket or hurt my knees while squatting.  I never  tracked my weight, diet, or bothered to log anything for that matter.</p>
<p>No longer.  Every detail of <a href="http://thisistrouble.com/2013/11/18/my-new-workout-regimen/">my workout</a> is meticulously logged in a journal and then expectations for the next round are set.  Now, when I’m finishing up my second workout of the day, every set is done to the point it takes every fiber of my being to complete my final repetition.  The majority of my food is made at home in my own kitchen, cutting out all of the garbage that fast food contains.</p>
<p>I’ve also noticed that as I’ve pushed myself harder, my worries about injuries have lessened.  I no longer fear the squat or shoulder press.  Thanks to the red pill, the amount of weight I can lift, my body composition, and diet have never been better.</p>
<h3>Cultivating Beneficial Hobbies And Ridding Yourself Of Poison</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/poison-bottle.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-25165" alt="poison-bottle" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/poison-bottle.jpg" width="170" height="254"></a></p>
<p>As mentioned, I’ve been a fitness enthusiast for a while.  Some of my other hobbies include guitar, writing, cars, and technology.  I was fortunate that I had some “cool” hobbies when taking the red pill.</p>
<p>There was a time, long ago though, that I played a <em>lot</em> of video games.  World of Warcraft?  Give me 14 hours a day, please.  I played Halo, Counter-Strike, and Call of Duty competitively, as if I was an athlete.</p>
<p>Pathetic.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I had desires to relapse and fire up the good ‘ol WoW account.  No longer.  I’ve realized that as a man, you must be improving and challenging yourself.  Things that take you out of reality, such as cable TV and video games, simply distract you from the pathetic state that your life is currently in.  It may make you feel better to watch reality shows like <em>Jersey Shore</em>, but ultimately you’re simply hamsterizing your own existence away.</p>

</div>
<p>The red pill has taught me to continue to cultivate current hobbies, and develop new ones.  My guitar practice sessions are structured to challenge myself more and more.  I try to write everyday at my personal blog.  I’ve also taken a few self defense classes and am starting to learn some Polish for my upcoming trip to Europe.</p>
<p>Thanks to the red pill, I’ve learned bettering and working on yourself every day will make yourself feel better, and raise your status in the eyes of others.</p>
<h3>The 40 Hour Week</h3>
<p>I was so thrilled to start my first full-time job out of college in February.  It only took me about six months to realize what everyone around here preaches – working at the mercy of a corporation <em>sucks</em>.  Truthfully, my job is not that bad at all.  My bosses are awesome, I usually enjoy the work, and the pay is good.</p>
<p>But something felt off. It never made sense to me – I thought it was bullshit that I was getting raped on taxes, and never getting any benefit from paying thousands and thousands of dollars to Uncle Sam every year.  Through the red pill, I’ve realized that American society is built upon a form of legal slavery.  The high powers want us all to report to work every day, so that they can continue to live their lavish lifestyles.  We continue to slave away because we have to in order to continue to fund <em>our</em> lavish lifestyles.</p>
<p>The hardest part is getting out.  I’m still struggling with coming to the reality that I will be miserable working in corporate America for the rest of my life.  It’s a tough pill to swallow, because everyone in my life encouraged me to go to college and get a job.  I actually got a job – so I’m far ahead of most current college grads, yet I don’t feel happy.  I feel like I signed up to fight a war…a war to give my heart and soul to my career to barely make it by.</p>
<p>That’s not a battle I’m going to fight.  I’ve been able to lay down a plan, and I’m hoping to be out of the corporate world by the time I’m 30.  I may adjust that if I feel my sanity slipping further and further down the hole.</p>
<p>Thanks to the red pill, I’ve realized that I don’t have to sell my soul completely.</p>
<h3>Travel</h3>
<p>I had never thought about leaving California, much less America.  From what everyone had ever told me, America was the best place in the world to live.  “The girls are the most beautiful!  They’re independent!  They don’t care what you think!  They can’t cook so you can eat out all the time!  They LOVE cats!”</p>
<p>These days, I simply play the game of the American girl.  I show them just enough interest so that they’re intrigued.  I escalate physically at the opportune times on our date.  I seed something back at my house that they just “have” to see.  Once back home, I pour them another drink and show them the item of interest.  I then tell them I want to play them a song on guitar – conveniently located in the bedroom.  It’s a monotonous routine, yet it gets me my nut at the end of the day.  However, if I do anything out of the ordinary, that sets me off as either a creep or a nice guy, neither of which are attractive to girls in America.</p>
<p>My eyes have been opened recently to travel.  I have no evidence besides the words of others, but I’ve realized I must see the world and see what else is out there.  I just booked my first trip to Europe last week – a week each in Poland and Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Thanks to the red pill, I have hope that girls in other parts of the world will outdo their American counterparts in every way.</p>

<h3>Friendship</h3>
<p>There is a sense of community amongst this part of the Internet.  Lots of guys who have never had the answers, and simply want to improve their lives.  I’ve been fortunate enough to meet some fellow bloggers in recent months and have had nothing but great things to say about them.  I consider them friends whom I can talk to about things that I can’t talk about at work, with blue pill friends, or even my family.</p>
<p><em>The red pill has taught me that the American world has made it tough on men, but yet, I’m not alone. </em></p>
<p>And…neither are you.  For those of you reading this that are just having your eyes opened to the thought processes of the red pill, understand that it is a very difficult journey.  It will take all of your will power, motivation, and courage to shed yourself of the beliefs you have been taught your whole life.  If you can stomach it though, you can improve your life in ways that are unimaginable.</p>
<p>A year ago, if you’d told me I’d sleep with as many girls as I have, be as in good of shape as I am in, have come this far already with blogging, or that I’d be taking two weeks off work to adventure in Europe by myself, I would have laughed in your face.  I will say this, though: the red pill is a better meal than anything you ate at the dinner table this holiday season.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, I sent out a mass ping text to tons of girls, including the girl I mentioned in the beginning of this post.  We got to talking about travels and what we’ve been doing for the last year.  We are going to meet up for some drinks next week.</p>
<p>If she says, “We’re not having sex tonight,” during the date, I doubt I’ll be able to contain the look of glee from spreading across my face.</p>
