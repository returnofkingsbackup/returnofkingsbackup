<p>2013 has been a pretty interesting year for ROK. The site has grown tremendously and I’m happy to have been a part of it. In celebration of the year’s end, I thought it prudent to take the time to look back at some of my best articles, some of which could be of value to the newer denizens of ROK. While I feel that all my articles can offer substantial value to readers, these four hit most directly on substantive lessons and themes that are crucial to this website’s mission and message.</p>
<h2>1. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/4853/why-this-site-will-always-be-creepy">Why This Site Will Always Be Creepy</a>
</h2>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tumblr_lsppbkQFwr1qi23vmo1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25284" alt="tumblr_lsppbkQFwr1qi23vmo1_500" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tumblr_lsppbkQFwr1qi23vmo1_500.jpg"></a></p>
<p>ROK’s growth this year and involvement in several viral episodes has brought a lot of hate this way. As per usual, much of this hate resorts to the use of terms like “creepy” to describe anyone who writes for or reads articles on this website and those like it.</p>
<p>This article will illustrate to you clearly why such claims are not only empty, but entirely impossible to stem and generally unworthy of engagement. Male self-improvement is has always been “creepy” to women and always will be. Your job is not to care.</p>
<h2>2. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/2090/how-black-america-has-predicted-our-future">How Black America Has Predicted Our Future</a>
</h2>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tumblr_lrd4a3utGB1qlqoewo1_500.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25281" alt="tumblr_lrd4a3utGB1qlqoewo1_500" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tumblr_lrd4a3utGB1qlqoewo1_500.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This was my first post of 2013. Plenty of time is spent in the manosphere discussing the future of American (and, more broadly, western) society and the some of the negative trends spreading within it. This discussion still draws much interest today in the manosphere and I suspect it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. This article will prove useful for those looking for a precedent capable of showing what our society’s potential destination may look like.</p>
<h2>3. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/13735/what-do-you-bring-to-the-table">What Do You Bring To The Table?</a>

<p>Self-reflection is crucial for any male concerned with self-improvement, but is too often forgotten by those who are romantically frustrated. When striving to obtain more socially from others, men (like women) must always be aware of what they bring to the table. Never lose sight of this or delude yourself into thinking it isn’t worth paying attention to. If you want quality in your romantic life, you must do all you can to ensure that you are of quality yourself.</p>
<h2>4. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8609/how-thirsty-men-kill-everyones-game">How Thirsty Men Kill Everyone’s Game</a>
</h2>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tumblr_luba29gJbu1r4qkwlo1_500.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25285" alt="tumblr_luba29gJbu1r4qkwlo1_500" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tumblr_luba29gJbu1r4qkwlo1_500.png"></a></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, feminists are not the biggest enemy of the red-pill male. That role is occupied by other men – white knights, simps, and genuinely thirsty individuals.<br>
It is imperative that all males concerned with self-improvement understand the behavior associated with these men, and avoid it at all costs.</p>

<p>This post was written at the end of December 2012, but contains a message so crucial that I’ve deemed it worthy of space in this review. The post answers several fundamental questions: What are we striving for here at ROK? What is the end game, the goal? What do we hope to accomplish? <strong>What is the point of “game” and the red pill?</strong></p>
<p>This article answers all of those questions and can quiet those who claim that “game” (and sites like ROK that promote it along with the red pill truths inherent to it) is nothing more than useless misogyny that can benefit no sensible man. There is a benefit here, and it is one that all young men concerned with substantive self-improvement should strive to obtain.</p>
<p>ROK has taken many steps forward in 2013 in what has been quite an interesting ride. With these messages in mind, here’s hoping we can all make 2014 even more remarkable than its predecessor.</p>
