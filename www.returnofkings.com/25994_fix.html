<p>Many groups are under attack for ill conduct by some members of their own group. The common phrase “N<em>ot all [insert group here] are like that</em>” is brought up by other members of the group to avoid association with the bad apple. In the manosphere, the phrase “N<em>ot all women are like that</em>” is used so often that we have simply abbreviated it as NAWALT. However, women are not the only group to use this argument.  Others include priests, law enforcement officers, and martial artists.</p>
<p>This argument means that members of any given group do not want to be judged by the actions of the worst of their group, even when they are happy to take credit for the actions of the best. If people wish this to be possible, then they must hold the members of their group to standards and take action when people fail to meet them.</p>
<p>On the contrary, many groups stay silent when a group member misbehaves, in order to avoid making waves or drama. Sometimes they will protect the group member out of loyalty. By doing this, they are enabling the bad behavior. The public will soon associate the entire group with the bad apples.</p>
<h3>Catholic Priests</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-25997" alt="catholics460" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/catholics460.jpg"></p>
<p>The role of a religious leader was to strengthen ties of community kinship by preaching about tolerance, love, and family, hoping to fight against man’s self-destructive impulses. The fact that almost every civilization had some religious figure in their communities shows that their service was worth more than the extra mouth to feed and the building to house them.</p>
<p>However, in order to do their job they need the trust and respect of the community. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_sex_abuse_cases#Criticisms_of_church_responses">flood of child abuse allegations</a> against the Catholic church has seriously undermined their credibility. Leaders in the Catholic church are claiming that many of their priests are being unfairly stereotyped by the media, even though they have done nothing wrong. In other words “N<em>ot all priests are like that</em>.”</p>
<p>As shown in the Wikipedia article linked above, men in the Catholic priesthood are no more likely than other men to be pedophiles, but what angers people is the cover up. When concerns were brought to the top leaders in the church, those leaders did nothing. Perhaps they didn’t believe that one of their own order would do such a thing. Maybe they were just cowards. However, the public perception is that the non-pedophile priests were defending the ones who were doing wrong on purpose.</p>
<h3>Law Enforcement Officers</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-26004" alt="Police guys" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Police-guys.jpg" width="460" height="329"></p>
<p>During the events of 9/11, law enforcement officers in New York along with other emergency workers did an incredible job of saving as many lives as they could in the aftermath of the attack. There is nothing unique about law enforcement in New York compared to other parts of the country. Therefore if the 9/11 attacks had happened elsewhere in the country, it is reasonable to assume that the officers there would respond with the same courage.  Across the country police were still heaped with well-deserved praise which they gladly accepted for being in the same group as the heroes of 9/11.</p>
<p>However, there are many stories of law enforcement acting badly. Overzealous police officers have killed people who have done little or nothing wrong in stories that can be found <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2013/02/21/connecticut-swat-team-raids-home-with-armored-car-shoots-and-kills-unarmed-occupant-and-pay-millions-in-damages-but-lead-officer-given-award-for-his-role-in-the-raid/">here</a>, <a href="http://jonathanturley.org/2008/07/30/police-officers-honored-after-raiding-wrong-home-and-shooting-up-house-occupied-with-a-family-of-eight/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.policestateusa.com/2013/john-geer-shot-by-police/">here</a>. In all of these situations, law enforcement acted with terrible judgment and they were protected by their own. Police officers do face many perils in their job, and getting shot is not a rare occurrence. So just like soldiers in a war they have very strong ties with each other and would not throw their comrades under the bus because they followed what was usually standard procedure.</p>
<h3>Martial Artists</h3>

</div>
<p>In one of my earlier <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/19076/how-to-spot-and-avoid-a-mcdojobelt-factory">posts</a> I talked about how the quality of martial arts schools have gone down in the last few decades. The good martial arts instructors did not protect the bad ones, but they did stay silent. These are two of the rules at my school word-for-word:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never argue with an instructor for he is always right.</li>
<li>Serve and obey without question.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules led to greater discipline in good schools, but the same rules applied to bad schools made students afraid to question their instructor on why they didn’t feel like they were learning how to actually fight. When fake martial arts schools first started popping, up the good teachers ignored it to the <a href="http://mcdojo-faq.tripod.com/#iamtheproductofamcdojo">detriment of the students who attended them</a>.</p>
<p>Now in order to combat the scourge of McDojos, if I ever have my own school I will demand that the students question me if they feel something is wrong. That lack of respect is something I will have to bear for belonging to a group that didn’t maintain the quality of its members in the past.</p>
<h3>Scientists</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-26010" alt="scientists" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/scientists.jpg" width="421" height="317"></p>
<p>This is the only group I would consider completely immune to this problem. Every time a scientist makes a claim he needs to back it up with an experiment and the experiment is checked by other researchers. If it is discovered that he falsified data, no other scientist will defend him. He is forever exiled from the group. That is why, outside of super-conservative religious groups, most people will take anything a scientist says on faith because they have so much well-earned credibility.</p>
<h3>Women</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-26012" alt="3 women" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/3-women.jpg" width="431" height="286"></p>
<p>It is well-known that women have a strong in-group preference: the sisterhood. Here are a few ways that women defend the wrongdoings of other women.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs0f_gELlFM">Divorcing a loyal husband</a> and taking full custody of the children to get more child support.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/16637/negative-hiv-tests-for-sale">Lying about being pregnant</a> in order to get a marriage proposal or money for a fake abortion.</li>
<li>Drugging your husband, tying him up, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkmanLIAdXI">chopping off his penis</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://jodiariasisinnocent.com/">Stabbing your boyfriend</a> 27 times and shooting him in the head and claiming self defense.</li>
</ul>
<p>No man on any manosphere site believes that most women are out to cut off their boyfriend’s dick and murder him. However, women will stand by the women who do these things or just stay silent most of the time. When this happens, women should not be surprised to find that they are being treated as an accomplice in spirit.</p>
<p>Men are more than ready to discipline their members for wrongdoing. When men found out what the Taliban were doing to women, they joined the military and risked their lives to stop them. It isn’t too much to ask women to speak out against their sisters at no risk to their life.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-26013 alignnone" alt="need fem to murder" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/need-fem-to-murder.jpg" width="424" height="281"></p>
<p>It is the job of the Catholic priesthood to ensure the integrity of the Church. It is the job of police officers to ensure the responsibility of their fellow officers. And it is the job of women to maintain the morality of the sisterhood.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that there are bad individuals in every occupation. However, when the good people defend the bad, they should expect that the public will regard them with the same level of disgust as the people who actually commit bad actions. If you stand beside a friend who is getting righteous shit thrown at him, then you can’t complain when some of it hits you too. People don’t think you are all “like that”, but they will not forgive you for defending those who are “like that.”</p>
