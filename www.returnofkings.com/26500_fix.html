<p>A little over a year ago when I was still fairly new to game I took my first trip to Montreal. I was bullshitting online and stumbled upon an article by <a href="http://nexxtlevelup.com">Virgil Kent</a> where he wrote, “If you get a chance to go on a date… take it.” Sounds simple enough, but do we follow this law? I know I didn’t as a beginner.</p>
<p>Here are a few reasons why you should live by this law until you get a few notches in:</p>
<h4>1. Practice makes perfect</h4>
<p>If you’re a beginner,you will often walk out of a date and get bombarded by ideas of things you should have said. This happened to me countless times when I started dating and sometimes it still does. I’d grunt at the missed opportunity to say a joke that related to our conversation topic and would have made her laugh and helped build attraction.</p>
<p>Lucky for me (and all of you), girls aren’t really that different from each other, especially in the states. Most girls have the same hobbies, watch the same shows, talk about the same things, etc. Chances are you will find yourself having the same conversations over and over again and eventually you will get it right and find your winning formula. After that, your confidence will increase tremendously and you won’t have to write topics on your sweaty palms anymore.</p>
<p>Whenever I have a date nowadays I don’t worry about how I’m going to amuse her or wow her. I know what will capture her interest because my  stories have been tested on women before her. I more often find myself crossing my fingers hoping she doesn’t bore me too much.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469);">2. You will create a sex sense</span></p>
<h4><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469);">It makes sense to pick your dates based off which girl you believe will give it up the easiest. The problem with this notion is that as a beginner you don’t know which girls those are, you only think you know.</span></h4>
<p>The summer before starting college I worked as a kitchen utensils salesman. My job was to do demos for friends and family in the hopes of making a sale. My boss preached the importance of doing as many demos as possible, no matter how sure we were the person wouldn’t buy anything. The reason? We were just starting off and had no idea what a customer looked like or sounded like.</p>
<p>I sold a grand worth of utensils my first day following the no discrimination policy. I have also banged multiple girls I would not have classified as DTF from the get go. When you’re a beginner in sales and dating, your best approach is to put yourself out there as much as possible till you catch repeated patterns and can tell which will surely buy, not buy, and are undecided. You can then set up your dates accordingly.</p>
<h4>3. Investment for the future</h4>
<p>Chances are if you’re a beginner you are still fairly young. Those $30-40 dates may seem expensive to you now, but let me tell you a secret—a lot of guys drop $100 plus on dates and most get nothing to show for it! This may seem strange to us, but women figure their company is worth it, don’t ask me why. You will save a ton of money in the future if you learn how to build attraction on a date without feeling the need to throw money at a girl in hopes of getting in her pants. I guarantee you she will eat your money faster than a slot machine.</p>
<p>When I began to date I had a few expensive dates where I got nothing more than a hug goodbye. I learned from my mistakes and now spend much less for much more.</p>

<h4>4. You will be more successful in other areas</h4>
<p>Dating will provide you with social skills that are priceless. In essence what dating teaches you is how to be charming and interesting. It will come in handy during interviews, in class, and anything that involves human interaction in general. You will feel more confident meeting people for the first time, whether it be a recruiter or hot blonde. I personally prefer the latter.</p>
<p>The list of things for which I have used knowledge derived from dating could go on forever. I’ve used it to get in teacher’s good graces, get out of trouble, persuade friends, etc. During my previous internship I found myself telling the same travel stories I’d tell a girl on the first date to the guys in the office. They loved it and wanted to hear more!</p>
<h4>5. Outsourcing Opportunities</h4>
<h3><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">If you traveled abroad you know how much greener the grass could get. If you’re like me and plan on living abroad after you accomplish a certain goal (finish school, saving x amount of dollars, etc.) then you may see little value in dating back at home.</span></h3>
<p>Let me tell you know how wrong you are. Game, just like jobs, can be outsourced. I’ve been in the trenches ever since I discovered game and it has given me a tremendous advantage over the men of countries I’ve visited. You may have to make small tweaks to your style of game but you will be pleasantly surprised from how easily you can clean up.</p>

<h4>6. It Will Help Your Approaching</h4>
<h3><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px; font-weight: normal;">Dating requires you to hold a conversation for a <strong>long</strong> time. I’d estimate my dates last anywhere between 2-3 hours. If you can keep a conversation for that long you think a 5 minute conversation will scare you away?</span></h3>
<p>As my dating increased so did my approaches. I feared rejection less and no longer feared that dreaded rolling tumbleweed moment. There were a few times I got numbers in spite of the girl being in a relationship because she enjoyed the conversation.</p>
<p>So go out and fill your weekend up, rookies! You can’t shoot 3 pointers if you can’t shoot from the foul line.</p>
