<h3>1. We’re paid in sex</h3>
<p>By your daughters, your girlfriends, your fiancées, your wives, and other members of staff. Resort workers put up serious weekly numbers. Exotic beaches trigger single women’s slut instincts. If she arrives alone its almost too easy. If she arrives with a partner it takes shockingly little effort to get her separated.</p>
<p>Resort pay typically ranges from poor to abysmal so access to a continual stream of cute guests is seen as a crucial benefit if indeed not the main one. This arrangement is fully condoned by management; resorts know they can get away with lower salaries if workers are “wifey-ing up.”</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maggiepool3.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-27980" alt="maggiepool3" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/maggiepool3.jpg" width="408" height="544"></a></p>
<h3>2. The innocent activities and games we play are far from innocent</h3>
<p>They’re for our benefit. During activities and excursions I have guests introduce themselves to each other with names and backgrounds. Innocent questions like hometown and favorite Disney movie are interspersed with more ulterior ones like stop light color (relationship status), celebrity crush (mate preference) and tattoo ownership (slut indicator). We use this information to more efficiently select targets. Kickball, volleyball, red rover and something called “the beach game” turn X-rated quickly. We’ll make up rules that may seem spontaneous but rest assured they aren’t—they’re designed to get women naked and hooking up.</p>
<p>I know one particularly well-endowed co-worker who had an effective tactic with couples and large groups. First, he would take them out on the boat to play a few drinking games. After the women were sufficiently inebriated he would institute a clothing-off policy in order to continue playing. Since the men were out on a boat with nowhere to go they had little choice but to play along or be deemed pussies by the rest of the boat. They would stand around timidly with their comparatively small penises while the women swooned over his massive member. One would always come find him later that night.</p>

<h3>3. We are pathetically grateful for tips</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously the financial component of our compensation is rarely much above poverty wages thus rendering us childishly appreciative for laughably meager sums. I still remember my first tip: two friendly Canadian guys handed me the equivalent of 5 dollars after a guest activity. I proceeded to introduce them to every cute girl in the hotel until they clicked with some hotties. I had the bartender send them free bottom shelf shots at the first lull in conversation. They didn’t sleep alone for the rest of their stay.</p>
<p>Bartenders write ad nauseam about the wisdom of taking care of servers; I would argue resort staff are a better allocation of resources because it takes a much smaller sum to impress and our ability to enable a bang is better (we have a more fun and intimate relationship with guests and we’re free to wander the resort to introduce people and take groups up to rooms, secluded balconies, staff quarters, etc.).</p>
<h3>4. Don’t mess with the staff</h3>
<p>We can ruin your vacation in any number of ways. This is sound advice for all customer-employee interactions but nowhere else have I experienced such a profound influence over customer experience. If you are a dickhead I can make sure you won’t get laid. If you are an entitled little princess I will go out of my way to make you feel unwanted and humiliated. This can range from the morally neutral (unfavorable seating/pairings during meals and activities) to the morally wrong (subtly letting it be known to the other guests that you are a creep) to the technically illegal (fighting you when I am drunk enough to not be held responsible).</p>
<p>Because pay is so low, management has little weight to reprimand its workers so more often than not complaints will fall on deaf ears. By accepting the unusual payment arrangement management has acquiesced a degree of authority over worker-guest interactions. Unless what I do is blatant, unambiguous and against the rules, management will most likely turn a blind eye to my behavior. They’d rather keep me hidden until you leave and let me continue unhindered then find and train a new employee. Because 99% of customers leave satisfied this is a deal they are more than happy to accept.</p>

<h3>5. In spite of what I just wrote, we actually love the guests</h3>
<p>I can only speak for Western employees typically in positions like hotel reception, surf instructors, tour guides, and so on (not housekeeping or kitchen). The guests are the reason we’re here. People at beach resorts are unsurprisingly a congenial lot and it’s impossible to dislike such a pleasant demographic. I’ve helped dozens of cool guests get laid, both guys and girls. In my estimate 90% of guests are great, 9% are neutral and maybe 1% are assholes. It’s only that 1% that would ever get detrimental treatment.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/luciasunglasses.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-27982" alt="luciasunglasses" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/luciasunglasses.jpg" width="448" height="336"></a></p>
<h3>6. We use code words for the guests that can be quite illuminating</h3>
<p>Sharks. Dolphins. Boppers. Cherries. Obviously many professions use code to describe customers: car salesmen have “tire-kickers” (non-serious buyers) and flight attendants have “spinners” (people who can’t find their seats), but due to close customer proximity and our relative youthfulness it’s more prevalent in this profession than others. It would be useless to explain actual terms because they vary from place to place but if you happen to overhear a worker speaking cryptically pay attention. It’s really not hard to decipher and you will benefit from their seasoned assessment. Also useful for locations: “nowhere,” “the dungeon,” “the bat cave.” If you know where we’re talking about then you will know where the party will be.</p>
<h3>7. Certain places produce sluts and certain places attract them</h3>
<p>We get to meet large numbers of women from all over the world and develop fairly accurate mosaics of slutiness based on where she’s from and where she chooses to travel. There are a few combinations that consistently produce rates at  the high end of the bell curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>American women studying abroad (bonus points for those who choose South America)</li>
<li>Southeast Asian girls who choose tourist hotspots (Bangkok, Phuket, Bali, Boracay)</li>
<li>American women who frequent the Caribbean.</li>
</ul>
<p>It should come as no surprise that America is ground zero for whores, and it becomes easy to see why Caribbean guys are so laid back—they have a never-ending supply of rich white girls flying down for sex. Side note: I only know one girl who studied abroad in Africa and she was almost a school-wide joke for the amount of dick she took. With such a small sample I can’t draw conclusions but if you have wider experience with this demographic please get in touch, I’m curious if my suspicions are true.</p>
<h3>8. Language is the only useful education the American education system provides for men</h3>
<p>Planeloads of cute little things from all over the world arrive weekly during the season and if you only speak English you are at a major disadvantage. Being American is not impressive in any way to many foreigners and is in fact often detrimental. Europeans, Asians and South Americans have seen too many of our drunken frat boys and whoring, slutty co-eds to have any respect for us just off the bat. That is until you tell them about the drink specials and ask them how their flight was in their own language. Then suddenly the table of pouty, teenage dreamboats straight off the plane from Madrid is at your full attention. Your value has just increased tenfold and eight eager little smiles greet you whenever you walk up to them. Virginities will be taken before the trip home.</p>
<p>The model quality Prada-toting 18-year-olds from Paris open up after you drop some French and wine knowledge. And by open up I mean they open their vaginas. If I could do college all over again I would opt for the highest-level language courses available and switch out my electives for a second language.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sophieeyes.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-27983" alt="sophieeyes" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/sophieeyes.jpg" width="466" height="339"></a></p>
<p>Not every resort is like this but the crazier ones certainly are. If you haven’t worked in one I would recommend you give it a try for a season. Also, I wouldn’t advise guys to allow their girlfriends to go to these places alone. If you do accompany her, don’t go to bed early if she’s staying up.</p>
