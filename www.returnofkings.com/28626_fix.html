<p>The days of men ruling the world and their own lives are long gone.  In today’s woman-ideal, leftist-inspired world, the masculine virtues that laid the foundation for our civilization are being buried deep below that foundation.  Without these masculine virtues that men used as the cornerstone of life, the aforementioned foundation will continue to crumble.</p>
<p>The best part is, a lot of these virtues are very simple things.  Do your part during Traditional Sex Roles Week, and up your masculinity level while getting your woman, or women…<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23backtothekitchen&amp;src=tyah">#BackToTheKitchen</a>.</p>
<h3>The House</h3>
<p>Man caves are pathetic.</p>
<p>In older times, the entire <em>house</em> was the man’s domain.  The only places that were unquestionably the woman’s area were the kitchen and the laundry room.  This is exactly how it should be.  Instead, we have men funding women’s entire <a title="The HGTV Channel Poisons Female Minds" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/15721/hgtv-poisons-female-minds">HGTV Network dream</a>, while they’re relegated to a singular room for their own pleasure.  On top of that, the man cave is usually designated as the room farthest from the living space, preferably the basement.</p>
<p>If you are considering buying a house, make it clear to the women in your life that <em>her</em> cave is the kitchen, and that you’ll gladly supply the essential equipment; i.e. an apron and heels.</p>
<h3>Home Maintenance</h3>
<p>Every man should know the following skills around the home:</p>
<p>1. Oil changes in vehicles<br>
2. Basic plumbing<br>
3. Hammer, drills, and other basic tools<br>
4. Electronic handiness and wiring</p>
<p>The greatest part is that even if you have never done any of these, your problem can usually be solved by a few minutes of Google searching and a mindset to figure it out.  For example, I recently hung a TV on the wall for the first time.  I had no idea how to do it or any parameters to abide by.  But, 10 minutes later, by watching a few YouTube videos and  reading How-To website, I was familiar with all of the tools and procedures to get the job done.</p>
<h3>
<strong></strong>Wrenching</h3>
<p>My father has told me stories how he grew up working on his own motorcycles, dirtbikes, and his Karmann Ghia, which he used to do donuts around dirt fields when he was fourteen years old without a driver’s license.</p>
<p>Gone are the days when men build classic cars in their garage.  Gone are the days when men would take pride in their machines, meticulously maintaining them with an attention to detail so high a single spot would not go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Nowadays, driving a Prius is the cool thing, with the classics being shamed as too high-maintenance and harmful for the environment.  Who wants to drive a ’65 Mustang or a Cobra when you have the high-tech power of a Toyota Prius/Nissan Leaf/insert other battery-powered snail?</p>
<p>That Karmann Ghia still sits in my grandparents barn as a testament to the wrenching skills and love of cars from my dad.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cobra.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-28718" alt="cobra" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/cobra.jpeg" width="288" height="216"></a></p>
<h3>Speaking Of Cars… How Many People Can Still Drive A Stick?</h3>
<p>A perfectly executed heel-toe downshift while driving my car is one of the things I look forward to most on my commute to work.  Every man should be able to work a stick with expert precision (no homo).  Being able to do so gives you complete control over your environment and vehicle.</p>
<p>As a bonus, being able to pull burnouts and chirping the tires will get panties wet.</p>
<p>As a second bonus, not many people will be able to steal your car if it’s a manual.</p>
<h3>A Strong, Masculine Physique</h3>
<p>It’s simple: there is simply too much encouragement for skinny-jean-wearing, borderline-anorexic, “muscles don’t matter” types of bodies.  Rather than being encouraged to do challenging, (somewhat) dangerous, and the most productive types of lifts (squats, deadlifts, bench press), instead, young males are told that muscles don’t matter, aren’t important, and have no impact on their sexual market value.</p>
<p>That’s a blatant lie.  Tell me, which one of these would inspire more moisture in the vaginal area?</p>
<p>The <em>skinny</em>, plaid-wearing fag sipping hot chocolate?</p>

<p>…or the <em>chiseled</em>, stone-cold killing physique of a Spartan warrior?</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gerard-sparta.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-28711" alt="gerard-sparta" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/gerard-sparta.jpg" width="252" height="218"></a></p>
<p>Sure, females will coo and aww about how adorable the first one is, but what’s important is to realize they’re talking about him in a completely different context.  Think of the context being similar to a puppy who just slipped and fell on the floor.</p>
<p>Be a Spartan.</p>
<h3>Callused Hands</h3>
<p>Gone are the days of men doing manual labor and developing rough, masculine hands.  Nowadays, it is frowned upon if you don’t use weight lifting gloves to do 15-pound bicep curls (poor form, none the less).</p>
<h3>Passion</h3>
<p>As I’ve written about before, Corporate America is basically <a title="We’re All Living The Human Resources Nightmare" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/28125/were-all-living-the-human-resources-nightmare">selling your soul to the devil</a>.  The men I encounter in my day-to-day life are just so…bland.  The life has left their eyes – at all ages.</p>
<p>Find your passion in life, whether it be music, entrepreneurship, writing, or any other sort of hobby.  No, Call of Duty does not count.</p>
<h3>Chivalry</h3>
<p>Don’t think for one second that I’m advising you start pulling out chairs and going extremely out of your way to be chivalrous on a first date.  There was a time, though, that doing chivalrous gestures like these wouldn’t be held against you.  With the fall of masculinity in general, these actions no longer are attractive to the fairer sex.  The tiny amounts of <a href="http://thisistrouble.com/2014/01/01/i-couldnt-go-dark-i-now-have-a-girlfriend-and-said-girlfriend-found-my-blog/">long-term relationship advice</a> that float around the Manosphere are quick to point out that you must balance your overall masculine and alpha traits with some occasional beta actions.</p>
<p>The problem is that men these days pussy foot so much, that <em>any</em> beta action as simple as opening a car door for a lady will send you straight down the path of jerking it to Internet porn.  Like this guy:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fag.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-28722" alt="fag" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fag.jpg" width="287" height="161"></a></p>
<h3>Bedroom Dominance</h3>
<p>You should never “make love.”  This seems like it’s every beta’s greatest fantasy these days. Thrusting slowly into a girl in missionary position, the whole time looking lovingly into her eyes.  He wants them to cum together while kissing gently.  Gag me.</p>
<p>Every fuck with any girl should be a balls-to-the-wall, pound her like she’s never been pounded before kind of effort.  Get her addicted to your dick and she will go to the moon and back (to the kitchen!) for you.</p>
<p>The best thing about being a man in the bedroom is that it’s hardly difficult.  Simply up the intensity and dominance of every session.  Be a selfish person; doing whatever you want to her and simply expect that she will like it.  Hint: she will like it rough.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dominant.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-28726" alt="dominant" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dominant.jpg" width="350" height="202" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dominant.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dominant-290x166.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"></a></p>
<h3>Decisiveness</h3>
<p>2014 “Man”: “Honey, what do you want to eat for dinner tonight?”</p>
<p>Wife: “I don’t know, you choose.”</p>
<p>Man: “I really don’t care baby, whatever YOU want!”</p>
<p>Regular readers of ROK understand exactly where this goes; and it’s a path that projects solely downward.  Realize, that as a man, it is your job to make each and every decision.  <em>It doesn’t even matter if you’re wrong.</em>  Stick to your guns, and make no apologies.</p>
<p>Women will never love you more.</p>
<p>Speaking of decisiveness; it’s time for you to make a decision.  Are you going to be a man and send her back to the kitchen, or are you going to retreat to your man cave with your dick in between your legs?</p>
