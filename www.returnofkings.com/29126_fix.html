<p>There are certain things that are almost universal truths once you ingest the red pill and understand the male vs. female dynamics. One such thing is the fact that male dominance/masculinity/”alpha-ness” attracts very feminine/sexual women, or within already attained females, creates high levels of lust and sexual desire. This result is better and more passionate sex.</p>
<p>Tuthmosis correctly pointed out that all girls <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/3009/all-girls-like-rough-sex">like rough sex</a>. Truth be told, they <em>love</em> it. I discussed my dominance experiment in a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8666/the-dominance-experiment">previous article</a> too, where I pointed out that “women love to be dominated. It is in their biology.” These articles stem from our own experiences with individual girls, repeated enough times to provide substantiation to our theories.</p>
<p>A few days ago Rollo Tomassi tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/RationalMale/status/432938284835028992">something</a> that sparked my interest.  It discussed how when men take on feminine roles in a relationship (i.e. chores/housework), it kills the female’s sexual drive. Not surprising really. But then I started to wonder however how this plays out across a larger scale. In other words, take out the individualistic analysis of a couple, or one’s experience, or a group of men’s experiences. Rather, how does this play out across a whole nation or culture? To answer that, I thought of some countries I have spent time in and how their girls’ sexual desires and raw passions compare to each other.</p>
<h4>Brazil</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="../wickedchopspoker.blogs.com/my_weblog/images/2008/03/11/ana_beatriz_barros_brazil.jpg" width="328" height="262"></p>
<p>The sexual energy these girls give off is remarkable. I cannot think of a country where the girls oozed more sex than Brazil. You have incredibly quick and lustful makeouts, Forró style dancing where you are essentially dry humping standing up, and of course great sex.</p>
<p>So what are the men like? Aggressive as hell. They will not take no for an answer when trying to make out with girls. To the point where they will corner them against a wall until the girl relents and makes out. They are also generally big dudes and very athletic – again a trait of high masculinity. If my theory is correct, then this is not a coincidence.</p>
<h4>Russia</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="../russianwomentruth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Russian-Women-Girl-in-the-Winter.jpg" width="230" height="344"></p>
<p>Yes I know I love Russian girls and talk about them a lot. But for good reason.</p>
<p>At first glance, you see the beauty of Russian girls. But then you speak to them and often times they come across as cold. You hear stories about how they are all gold diggers and materialistic bitches, and perhaps the expression “ice queens” makes an appearance.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>But battle through that first layer, and you will be handsomely rewarded. No set of foreign girls—in my experience at least—have consistently been so sexually intense and frankly as animalistically loving of sex as Russian girls have been. They cherish every second and aspect of sex, something you can see on their faces and hear in their gasps for air during the rhythmic coitus.</p>
<p>So then we ask again, what are the men like?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="../images.politico.com/global/2014/01/17/140118_aron_sochi_putin_berlusconi_ap.jpg" width="395" height="261"></p>
<p>Well if you’e ever been to Russia, the country exudes traditional gender roles amplifying male masculinity and dominance. On top of that, there is no such thing as pedestalizing women there. If one leaves, another will come along—this is the attitude Russian men harbor. In America, men seeking to do well with women are essentially urged to adapt a Russian man’s attitude, i.e. be objectively indifferent and aloof.</p>
<p>I’ve traveled a lot. Is it a coincidence that the girls I’ve found consistently to provide the best sex come from a land where the men are arguably as alpha as they come? Maybe, maybe not. But it’s hard to ignore the coincidence.</p>
<h4>On The Other Hand…</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone" alt="" src="http://blogs.philadelphiaweekly.com/music/files/2012/09/American-Girls.jpg" width="309" height="309"></p>
<p>You have American girls. Sex is the last thing on a lot of their minds—after Facebook, brunch and sadly their careers. Yes they are slutty and fuck quickly, and yes they act like pornstars in the sack. But it’s contrived and fake. Just as girls are brainwashed into thinking they should be feminists, they are brainwashed into thinking they should act like complete cum guzzlers in the bedroom. There’s a huge difference between being “a lady in the street and a freak in the bed” and “a bitch on the streets and a human toilet in the bed.”</p>
<p>And again, I do not think it is a coincidence that American girls are like this given the majority of the male population has become emasculated “men,” drifting ever so quickly into these neutral gender roles.</p>
<p>Sex is the purest and most raw form of passion, emotion, feeling, and desire two humans can naturally have with one another. So to maximize this, the man and the woman have to put forth their most natural forms.</p>
<p>Men are the leaders. So when men are actually men, women will want to actually be women. And where you have this acceptance of the natural state, as you do in some countries, you have the closest thing to what sex should be.</p>
