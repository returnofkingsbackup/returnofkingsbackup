<blockquote><p>Daddy’s flown across the ocean<br>

<p>Quick, pop quiz.  Where is this excerpt from?</p>
<ol>
<li>A famous rock song, or</li>
<li>A poem about an alpha male leaving his wife and child because she’s due to hit the wall</li>
</ol>
<p>If this was posted on a Manosphere forum or blog in today’s world, one might think that the writer was writing about an alpha who left his aging woman for lands where he assumed the grass to be greener.</p>
<p>“<em>Leaving just another memory…it was just a brick in the wall.”</em></p>
<p>What does this mean?  Could it mean the woman was simply another notch on the bedpost?  Another woman simply left in the wake of a man making his mark on the world, and living his life exactly how he wanted to live it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, <em>Another Brick In The Wall (above is Part I)</em> was released in 1979, long before the times in which men started keyboarding jockeying-terms such as peacocking and hypergamy.  It is also probably safe to assume that the members of Pink Floyd were too busy banging their way through groupies, creating alpha widows by the dozen, to ever give real worry about what their <a href="http://www.thewallanalysis.com/main/another-brick1.html">song really meant</a>.</p>
<p>Alas, I am not a rock star.</p>
<p>In today’s world, The Wall can generally be summed up as the point in time in which a woman sees her value to the opposite sex fall drastically.  Of course, this value is primarily derived from a woman’s looks, according to point number six of the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/about">ROK community beliefs:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>6. A woman’s value is mainly determined by her fertility and beauty. A man’s value is mainly determined by his resources, intellect, and character.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the wall can also be accelerated, or slowed by offspring, habits such as diet and exercise, and overall pleasantness and femininity.  <a href="http://therationalmale.com/2012/07/18/the-wall/">Rollo Tomasi</a> has a great article about The Wall that goes into further detail about these factors.</p>
<p>To this part of the Internet though, The Wall is a badge of pride.  When we talk about the women who reject us, string us along, and hurt us to the point where we are forced to reflect upon ourselves, there seems to be a common phrase along the following lines dropped it response:</p>
<p><em>“Well, wait until SHE hits the wall.  She has it coming, the bitch.”</em></p>
<p>This phrase is nothing but a bitter mask to hide behind ourselves.  A way to brace for the rejection, embarrassment, and difficulties of having beautiful women in your life, whether it be <a href="http://thisistrouble.com/2013/08/30/field-report-5-girls-in-5-days-day-5-recap/">a harem</a> or a single <a href="http://thisistrouble.com/2014/01/01/i-couldnt-go-dark-i-now-have-a-girlfriend-and-said-girlfriend-found-my-blog/">long-term relationship</a>.  Truthfully, it’s nothing but a self-defense mechanism, or he<em></em>ll, <em>a wall, </em><em></em>to protect ourselves and our masculinity.</p>
<p>Look, I get it.</p>
<p>It’s hard not to think like that when your 38-year-old, increasingly saggy wife cheats on you with the mailman.  You can’t help but think that her best days are long gone, and that in her aging state she’ll never find a new man willing to put up with her shit.</p>

<p>It’s hard not to think like that when the sexy party girl tells you that, “You’re just such a good friend, we could never be together”, then proceeds to take it up the ass backstage from the bass player of a shitty indie band.  You can’t help but look forward to the days that the late nights, hard drugs, and countless cocks gobbled on will catch up to her, and leave her a shell of her former self.</p>
<p>I understand, because I’ve been there, done that.  I’ve bashed girls I have dated, <em>endlessly</em>, and cackled manically as they gained weight and lost the sexiness that drew them to me in the first place.  I have no doubt this will become even more readily apparent as I begin to reach my prime during my 30’s as a male.  However, the endless bashing and laughing accomplished nothing for me other than a short-term band-aid, in which I could feel a little better about myself.</p>
<p>I realized it was nothing but a way to protect my fragile ego, because my own inner self and confidence couldn’t handle a woman treating me the way they sometimes did.  In a bitter state, such as after being screwed over by a girl, it’s easy to fill with rage and hope that you can channel that energy towards sending a woman head-on into The Wall.</p>
<p>You can’t.</p>
<p><em>That rage accomplishes nothing.</em></p>
<p>Your buddies will tire of the charade quickly.  If they’re good friends, they’ll tell you to shut up and get on with your life.  If you were to tell a girl directly that she is going to hit The Wall, she would simply laugh at you, and further prove her point that she was right to reject you, break up with you, or otherwise humiliate you in the way that she did.</p>
<p>So why waste your precious breath spitting vile at women for hitting The Wall?</p>
<p>That is wasted energy that you can easily channel towards better things, simply being the best you can be.  There are a plethora of articles on this site that relate to self-improvement in a variety of ways.  If you search around, you are bound to find several things that you can improve on, and that you can find a passion for.  Pick your poison.  Don’t let that poison be your own bitterness seething beneath your skin.</p>
<p>The third and final part of<em> Another Brick In The Wall</em> reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t need no arms around me.<br>
And I don’t need no drugs to calm me.<br>
I have seen the writing on the wall.<br>
Don’t think I need anything at all.<br>
No! Don’t think I’ll need anything at all.<br>
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall.<br>
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice how the last verse has a slight variation between the first and final parts:</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong> All in all <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it was</strong></span> all just bricks in the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Second: </strong>All in all <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you were</strong></span> all just bricks in the wall.</p>
<p>The most talented artists leave their work open to interpretation.  I doubt Pink Floyd thought they were contributing to 2014 modern-day seduction when they penned those lyrics in the 70’s, but they sent a great message.</p>
<p>Do not let <em>any</em> woman cause you to harbor resentment, because it is simply wasted energy.  Stop hoping desperately for old girls to hit The Wall so you can look them up on Facebook for a brief chuckle.  This bitterness and mask for insecurity is simply a distraction from living a complete and fulfilling life as a man.</p>
<p>Woman are simply one piece of the puzzle, and one singular women should never be the entire foundation of your life.</p>
<p>They’re all just bricks in the wall.</p>
