<p style="text-align: left;">Last year I gave up my <a title="5 Reasons To Learn Krav Maga" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/4552/5-reasons-to-learn-krav-maga">Krav Maga</a> self-defense training when I was in the middle of changing jobs. I never picked it back up.</p>
<p>While I stay quite busy splitting my time between my three main sources of income, last month I began to feel like something was missing. I was getting too comfortable with my daily routine– bored, too.</p>
<p>So I decided to start training in martial arts again, this time signing up for a Muay Thai gym. It’s already reinvigorated my sense of drive across other areas of my life. Here are the top 5 reasons you should start a new hobby today.</p>
<h3>1. It breaks up your current routine</h3>
<p>As humans we search for a sense of regularity. We often find it in our daily activities.</p>
<p>For example, my days typically consist of working from home in the morning, primarily on my computer, lifting weights, and then training a few clients in the late afternoon and evening. I enjoy this routine, but flying on autopilot has its dangers.</p>
<p>You aren’t as sharp. Everything is too calculated and expected. By training  in Muay Thai every other day I have something new to look forward to. It also has changed my lifting routine, to accommodate for the added exercise and fatigue.</p>
<h3>2. It pushes you outside of your comfort zone</h3>
<p>When I stepped into the Muay Thai gym for the first time I didn’t know what to expect. It was a lot different than the place I used to train Krav Maga at– more serious, less friendly even.</p>
<p>The seasoned fighters looked at me with a sense of superiority. And they were superior. But rather than backing down, being nervous, and quitting after one day– I took this as a challenge.</p>
<p>I was far from comfortable training that day. I wasn’t able to execute crisp Thai kicks or jump rope like a boss.  But being too comfortable can be a bad thing. You’ll cease to explore new opportunities and your growth with falter across the board.</p>
<p>By throwing yourself at something new, that you’re inexperienced at, you’ll be pushed outside of your comfort zone. This is a good thing. You must stay accustomed to living at the edge of your comfort zone to ensure steady growth and progress.</p>

<h3>3. You’ll learn new skills</h3>
<p>This point is obvious. By taking Muay Thai, I’ll learn a host of new fighting skills.</p>
<h3>4. It gives you a new area to set goals for</h3>
<p>The habit of setting and achieving goals is the most important habit a man can build. By entering into a new hobby, you now have a whole new area of your life that where you can practice setting and accomplishing goals.</p>
<p>For my Muay Thai experience I’ll start small. My first goal is to be able to execute a Thai kick with my left and have it feel as natural as with my right. I’ll work my way up to bigger goals as I improve.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of starting at something from scratch. At first you’ll set one small goal after another. This cycle will build momentum, and before you know it, you’ll no longer be a novice. More importantly, this momentum will carry over to other areas of your life and give you the confidence to crush more and bigger goals.</p>
<h3>5. You’ll meet new people</h3>
<p>Another obvious point. When you try something new, you’re bound to meet new people. Whether these turn out to be man friends or cute girls depends on the hobby you choose, but either way meeting new people is always a positive thing.</p>
<h3>Potential Hobbies</h3>
<p>I’ll leave you with a short list of potential hobbies for you to try today:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Martial arts/self-defense: Muay Thai, Brazilian Ju-Jitsu, Krav Maga<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Cooking<br>
<strong>3.</strong> Salsa Dancing<br>
<strong>4.</strong> Lifting weights (you should already be doing this)<br>
<strong>5.</strong> Yoga<br>
<strong>6.</strong> Writing<br>
<strong>7.</strong> Mountain Biking</p>
