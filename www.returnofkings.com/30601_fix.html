<p>Nearly 45 years ago, Canadian band The Guess Who released one of classic rock’s archetypal hits to critical acclaim, quickly reaching #1 on the Billboard Top 100 list. What originally was meant as an allegorical critique on American foreign policy regarding the Vietnam war, portraying the country as an unstable woman, the dust of the 20th century has settled and we can now analyze the song in a more literal way.</p>
<p>Though its lyrics may be simplistic, they have come to perfectly encapsulate the turbulent and chaotic behavior of young Anglo women in the 21st century. Right off the bat, lyricist and singer Burton Cummings goes for the jugular:</p>
<p><em>American woman, stay away from me</em><br>
<em>American woman, mama, let me be</em><br>
<em>Don’t come a-hangin’ around my door</em><br>
<em>I don’t wanna see your face no more</em></p>
<p>Recently, a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2440005/Divorce-mans-health-Separation-increases-risk-death-substance-abuse-suicide-depression.html" target="_blank">UK study</a> concluded that divorced men are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol, have high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, and are 39% more likely to commit suicide. While the study’s statistics are significant, they are hardly surprising. According to the <a href="http://www4.hrsdc.gc.ca/.3ndic.1t.4r@-eng.jsp?iid=37" target="_blank">2006 Canadian census</a>, there were 8.6 million families at roughly 2.5 people per household. Considering that here in Canada, roughly 50% of those marriages end in divorce, <a href="http://www.divorceportalca.com/divorce-rates-in-canada/" target="_blank">75% of them being initiated by women</a>, 3.25 million men will be taken to the proverbial cleaners – unwillingly exposed to the serious health risks mentioned above, not to mention the financial burden it will place on them to continue to support their broken household. With figures like these, it is hardly surprising marriage rates have been steadily declining for the last 60 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><em>I got more important things to do</em><i><br>
<em>Than spend my time growin’ old with you</em></i></p>
<p>As noted in the marriage rates above, men are increasingly choosing to opt out of marriage and make more sensible life choices. Whether it be to devote time to a personal side business, travel extensively, master a skill or hobby, or simply bed as many young women as possible, young men are simply no longer interested in buying a depreciating asset – they would rather invest the time and money back into themselves to become a person of true value and worth.</p>
<p>Simply put, there are absolutely no incentives for men to get married and grow old with a woman, picking one or several of the above “more important things to do” is far more rewarding financially and emotionally than walking down the aisle. Oddly enough, it is this investing in oneself to create a well-rounded man who creates an incredible attraction from women, making it a romantically rewarding choice as well.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;" align="center"><em>Coloured lights can hypnotize</em><i><br>

<p>Recently covered on Return of Kings are two cases of young men driven to kill by the allure of a woman, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/29811/why-young-men-need-the-red-pill">Why Young Men Need the Red Pill</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/27858/the-tragedy-of-letting-a-broken-woman-into-your-life">The Tragedy of Letting a Broken Woman Into Your Life</a>. Not to ignore the strong possibility of personal trauma or mental illness bubbling below the surface of these adolescent minds, but Kell and Wade were each so consumed with desire for a specific woman in their life that they resorted to theft, deceit, violence, and even murder in hopes of winning their affection.</p>
<p>As two isolated incidents, the truly sad fact is that most cases like this go unreported. While most differ wildly in scope, severity and outcome, anecdotal evidence confirms that events where men are emotionally enslaved to aiming to please a woman happen on a daily basis. We all know of a man, whether close friend or acquaintance, recently or years ago, who went to extreme lengths in hopes of winning over a woman. It started out innocently, constantly striking up awkward conversations, trying to buy her attention with gifts and promises, then turned serious with stalking, threats, attempts at controlling, or sometimes worse.</p>
<p>Whether the choice is to seek the greener pastures of foreign countries or simply sleep with easy North American women without commitment, men are increasingly becoming aware of the poisonous frame of mind many of these Anglo women now have. A realization has occurred, long overdue, by the sexual market place’s elite men: these women are attempting to coerce, convince, and pressure them into submission. These men have then made a conscious choice to either avoid them altogether, or learn to extract as much sex from them while limiting what they exchange in commitment and resources. They have bowed out of the race, and will let the next chump’s eyes be sparkled with something glittery that is not gold.</p>
<p>With these three small and brief quotes from a classic rock song, we can extract an incredible amount of information about the current state of women and their motives. One can only wonder, that some 44 years ago, the men writing the song would ever have any idea that their definitive single would foreshadow the decline of the once great creature, <em>the American Woman.</em></p>
