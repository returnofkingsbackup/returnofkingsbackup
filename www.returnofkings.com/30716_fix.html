<h3><b>Part I – Scientific Repression</b></h3>
<p><b>1</b>. Do I not disagree that the Roman Catholic Church played a major role in repressing all major scientific and technological innovation in Europe for the greater part of 1000 years after the fall of the Roman Empire? From approximately A.D. 400 to A.D. 1400?</p>
<p><b>2</b>. Do I not disagree that the invention of the Gutenberg Press in 1450, and the fall of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_constantinople" target="_blank">Constantinople</a> in 1453 (resulting in an influx of more advanced Arabic &amp; Turkish knowledge into Europe) finally began to end this Catholic stranglehold of scientific repression and knowledge enslavement?</p>
<p><b>3</b>. Do I not disagree that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age" target="_blank">Dutch Golden Age</a> of the 1600s was attributed to the Dutch Republic’s climate of intellectual and religious tolerance? And that this religious freedom (uncommon for the era) made Dutch science and technology the most acclaimed in the world during this time?</p>
<p><b>4</b>. Do I not disagree that Charles Darwin’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_evolution" target="_blank">Theory of Evolution</a> in the 1800s was based upon tangible evidence and sound reasoning? And that the discoveries of dinosaurs and other fossils which are millions of years old, proves that our Earth is far older than the mere <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/2013/05/29/lawrence-krauss-teaching-creationism-is-child-abuse/" target="_blank">6,000 years</a> that many Christians believe?</p>
<p><b>5</b>. Do I not disagree that if Christianity never existed, we could very well be at a level of technology and cultural enlightenment so unfathomably advanced, beyond our wildest dreams, in the year 2014?</p>
<h3><b>Part II – Bad Popes</b></h3>
<p><b>6</b>. Do I not disagree that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadaver_synod" target="_blank">Cadaver Synod</a> of 897 (the posthumous ecclesiastical trial of Catholic Pope Formosus) was one of the most bizarre, freaky, and disgusting scenarios in the history of humanity?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Christians-cadaver-synod.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Christians-cadaver-synod-300x199.jpg" width="300" height="199"></a></p>
<p><b>7</b>. Do I not disagree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Stephen_VI" target="_blank">Pope Stephen VI</a> was a pitiful excuse to be leader of the Catholic Church, as his conduct towards the rotting remains of his predecessor, Pope Formosus, were extremely vile and depraved?</p>
<p><i>(The rotting corpse of Formosus was exhumed and put on trial in the so-called Cadaver Synod in January 897. With the corpse propped up on a throne, a deacon was appointed to answer for the deceased pontiff. The corpse was accordingly found guilty, stripped of its sacred vestments, and deprived of three fingers of its right hand.)</i></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-stephen-vi.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-stephen-vi-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<p><i></i><b>8</b>. Do I not disagree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Ix" target="_blank">Pope Benedict IX</a> was a pitiful excuse to be leader of the Catholic Church? Due to living an extremely dissolute life, having few qualifications for the papacy other than connections with a socially powerful family, being repeatedly accused of rape and murder, and for selling the papacy like it was nothing more than a commodity?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a disgrace to the Chair of Peter” – The Catholic Encyclopedia</p>
<p>“a demon from hell in the disguise of a priest… occupied the chair of Peter and profaned the sacred mysteries of religion by his insolent courses” – Ferdinand Gregorovius, Papal Historian</p>
<p>“his rapes, murders and other unspeakable acts. His life as a pope was so vile, so foul, so execrable, that I shudder to think of it”- Pope Victor III</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-benedict-IX.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-benedict-IX-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<p><i></i><b>9</b>. Do I not disagree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_V" target="_blank">Pope Nicholas V</a> (1397-1455) was a pitiful excuse to be leader of the Catholic Church, as he authorized the King of Portugal in 1452 to enslave any and all non-believers in perpetuity through the Dum Diversas?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Papal Bull of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dum_Diversas" target="_blank">Dum Diversas</a>, 18th of June 1452</p>
<p>“We grant you [Kings of Spain and Portugal] by these present documents, with our Apostolic Authority, full and free permission to invade, search out, capture, and subjugate the Saracens and pagans and any other unbelievers and enemies of Christ wherever they may be, as well as their kingdoms, duchies, counties, principalities, and other property […] and to reduce their persons into perpetual slavery.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><i></i><b>10. </b>Do I not disagree that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_vi" target="_blank">Pope Urban VI</a> was a pitiful excuse to be leader of the Catholic Church, due to his very violent temperament, and that he complained he did not hear enough screaming when Cardinals who had conspired against him were being tortured to death?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-urban-vi.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-urban-vi-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<h3><b>Part III – Wars &amp; Atrocities</b></h3>
<p><b>11</b>. Do I not disagree on the ridiculousness that after the World War I <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_truce" target="_blank">Christmas Truces</a> of 1914, the soldiers of various nations across Europe (all following Christianity) resumed shooting at each other the following day by order of their political and military superiors? But this time against their new found friends?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-truce.jpeg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-truce-150x150.jpeg" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<p><b>12</b>. Do I not disagree that all of the 40,000-60,000 women in Europe and North America who were executed during the Witch Hunts that occurred between 1480-1750, were more than likely innocent of all accusations? And that these were instances of fundamentalist Christian mass hysteria and ignorance, and completely lacking in compassion or logic?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-witch.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-witch-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<p><b>13</b>. Do I not disagree on the ridiculousness that Wehrmacht personnel in Nazi Germany were made to invade nations, loot property, murder and enslave various ‘Untermensch’ (Sub Humans), and commit other heinous crimes all while wearing a belt buckle inscribed with “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gott_mit_uns" target="_blank">Gott mit uns</a>” (God with us)?</p>

<p><b>14</b>. Do I not disagree that the Spanish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquistador" target="_blank">Conquistadors</a> made an absolute mockery of the so-called “peaceful” Christian religion which they claimed to follow? By raping, pillaging, enslaving, and decimating all major Native American civilizations they came in contact with during the Age of Discovery?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-conquistadors.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-conquistadors-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198"></a></p>
<p><b>15</b>. Do I not disagree that George W. Bush claimed he was ‘<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/07/iraq.usa" target="_blank">told by God</a>’ to end the tyranny in Iraq? And that this conflict has directly or indirectly caused the death of at least 500,000 innocent Iraqis and many thousands of <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/2013/12/26/the-american-national-religion-the-cult-of-the-uniform/" target="_blank">U.S. troops</a>, based on a story of lies and deception?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-george-bush.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-george-bush-300x141.jpg" width="300" height="141"></a></p>
<h3>
<b>Part IV – </b><b>Evil Bible Verses</b>
</h3>
<p><b>16</b>. Do I not disagree that <strong>Psalm 137:9</strong> “<i>Happy they shall be who take your little ones and dash them against the rock</i>” is so morally repugnant that it’s making infanticide sound like a party?</p>
<blockquote><p>(“No moral justification can be offered for this notorious concluding line. All one can do is to recall the background of outraged feeling that triggers the conclusion.” – Robert Alter, Bible Scholar)</p></blockquote>
<p><b>17</b>. Do I not disagree that <strong>Peter 2:18</strong> “<i>Slaves, accept the authority of your master with all deference, not only those who are gentle but also those who are harsh</i>” has no place in a civil society where all human beings have the right to personal liberty, and to appropriately retaliate when they are being oppressed?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/braveheart-movie-quotes.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/braveheart-movie-quotes-300x193.jpg" width="300" height="193"></a></p>
<p><b>18</b>. Do I not disagree that <strong>Kings 2:23-24</strong> “”<i>From there Elisha went up to Bethel. While he was on his way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him. “Go up baldhead,” they shouted, “go up baldhead!” The prophet turned and saw them, and he cursed them in the name of the Lord. Then two shebears came out of the woods and tore forty two of the children to pieces</i>” is a bit of a harsh, bizarre, and exaggerated punishment for teasing a prophet of God for simply having a bald head? Especially when directed against such young children?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-she-bears.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-she-bears-300x272.jpg" width="300" height="272"></a></p>
<p><b>19</b>. Do I not disagree that <strong>Samuel 15:2-3</strong> “<i>This is what the Lord of hosts has to say: ‘I will punish what Amalek did to Israel when he barred his way as he was coming up from Egypt. Go, now, attack Amalek, and deal with him and all that he has under the ban. Do not spare him, but kill men and women, children and infants, oxen and sheep, camels and asses” </i>Is a passage of wanton and indiscriminate mass murder which is not suitable for this religion of ‘peace’?</p>
<p><b>20</b>. Do I not disagree that <strong>Deuteronomy 22:28-29</strong> “<i>If a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her” </i>is sheer lunacy? What kind of God would mandate that a rape victim marry her attacker?</p>

<h3><b>Part V – General Questions</b></h3>
<p><b>21</b>. Do I not disagree that countries such as Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands are among the most prosperous, peaceful, and charitable societies on Earth? And that these traditionally Christian nations ironically have among the <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/2013/05/24/frans-de-waal-morality-without-religion/" target="_blank">highest percentages</a> of non-religious, agnostics, and atheists in the world?</p>
<p><b>22</b>. Do I not disagree that the United States and Brazil, the two most populous countries on Earth where the vast majority of inhabitants claim Christianity as their religion, have far higher per capita instances of robbery, rape, and murder than largely non-religious Northern Europe?</p>
<p><b>23</b>. Do I not disagree that the state of Mississippi is the most religious state in the USA, yet it bottoms out on many national social indicators which are not complimentary? Such as being the poorest and most obese? In addition to having the lowest life expectancy, lowest reading and math scores, lowest prevalence of STEM careers, and the highest infant mortality rate in the nation?</p>
<p><b>24</b>. Do I not disagree it’s disheartening that God is supposed to be all-knowing and all-powerful, and capable of divine intervention, yet has never once intervened (with solid proof) to stop a good or righteous person from being tortured, mutilated, gravely injured or killed by wicked persons, animals, or the forces of nature?</p>
<p><b>25</b>. Do I not disagree it’s a ridiculous concept that God is supposed to be all-powerful and capable of miracles, yet has no power and control over something as petty as money? And that we as flesh-and-blood humans are supposed to fill the void by constantly donating to charities, churches, and other religious organizations with our hard-earned fiat currency?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-monopoly.gif"><img alt="" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/christians-monopoly-150x150.gif" width="150" height="150"></a></p>
<h3><b>Conclusion – The Red Pill Truth</b></h3>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;" align="center">“The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the sun, in which they put a man called Christ in the place of the sun, and pay him the adoration originally payed to the sun.” – (Thomas Paine)</p>
