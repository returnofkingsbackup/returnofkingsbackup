<p><strong>Meet Joe:</strong></p>
<p>At 34.4 years old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_Joe">Joe</a><strong> </strong>has done everything right in his life. He’s married with two children and supports his family with a $32,000/year office job. Joe has a bit of money in the bank, but most of his salary goes to his mortgage and car payments. Having reached his physical prime at 23 Joe stopped exercising like he used to. At <a href="http://www.elitefeet.com/are-you-an-average-man">5’9” 175lbs</a> <strong></strong> Joe can run an 8.5 minute mile, bench 160lbs and do one pullup.</p>
<p>Joe is content with his life, but a few months from now his wife will give him divorce papers because she found a new man named “Chad” who made her feel alive. Luckily for Joe his wife Jane was a kind woman. All she asked of him was to share the custody of their two children and help out with expenses until the children can follow in he and Jane’s footsteps.</p>
<p>Joe is at his sexual prime and is not too far away from his financial prime. After the divorce he spends his time reminiscing about the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19374216/ns/health-sexual_health/t/new-survey-tells-how-much-sex-were-having/#.UPiTiGfNmwd">3 sexual partners</a> he had before Jane. He’ll be too scared to call up his high school sweetheart Jessica and will spend the rest of his days working a banal job, going home to watch TV, drinking beer, and eating fast food. He will die empty and completely alone after having sex with only 3 more women.</p>
<p>This is the average man according to various articles on the internet, but how many men do you see that have it ‘worse’ or ‘better’ than Joe? How many of you have friends who aspire to be nothing more than average or slightly above average. They’ll tell you their plans about having sex with girls in university, getting a degree, then a good job, then a family. You’ll ask them “Don’t you want more?” they’ll reply with dream cars, vacations, and children. Again you will ask them “Don’t you want more?” and they will reply “What more is there?”</p>

<p><strong>What More Is There?<br>
</strong></p>
<p>It is easy to see that “most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them.” This song is passion, ambition, drive, motivation, whatever you want to call it. It is the feeling of <a href="http://dangerandplay.com/he-hormone-testosterone-replacement-therapy/">testosterone coursing through your veins</a> <strong></strong>and the thrill of accomplishment. It’s waking up every day and knowing that you are living for yourself, improving yourself, and doing anything you want to do.</p>
<p><strong></strong><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/2859/when-are-a-mans-best-years">It’s always great to be a man</a>, but only if you work at it. When has the average guy ever done anything great? If you are reading this then you are more than likely far from average. If you set your mind to it you can accomplish more in a year than the average man will accomplish in his lifetime.</p>
