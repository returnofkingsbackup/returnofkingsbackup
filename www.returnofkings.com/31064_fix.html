<p>I think now more than ever it is of the utmost importance to school our younger brothers who are just starting out on their journey that one of the fundamental truths of life is <i>nothing ever really changes</i>.  In the words of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Course_of_Empire">Lord Byron</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p><em>There is the moral of all human tales;</em><br>
<em> ‘Tis but the same rehearsal of the past,</em><br>
<em> First freedom and then Glory – when that fails,</em><br>
<em> Wealth, vice, corruption – barbarism at last.</em><br>
<em> And History, with all her volumes vast,</em><br>
<em> Hath but one page…</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Throughout the course of human existence, there have been many empires and civilizations.  In their infancy, the exploded onto the world stage with a vengeance, usually throwing off some oppressive yoke of the previous regime and ushering in a new age.  When they rose, they used military might to assimilate different lands into their empire and made rapid advances in technology and ideas, culminating in being recognized as a beacon of inspiration and hope for the future.  When they inevitably fell, the pattern of events leading up to their demise was always the same, and the cycle began anew with a different civilization.</p>
<p>When you know what the warning signs are, you can better prepare yourself for what the future holds.  Unfortunately for us, most of the younger generation in the West don’t even recognize these signs, and the ones that do can’t be bothered to pay attention to them.  That is something we shall have to remedy.</p>
<h4><b><i>“War Is Upon You Whether You Would Risk It or Not”</i></b></h4>
<p>The first thing you must understand is that we are not living in a time of peace.  And I don’t mean Iraq and Afghanistan and all the things going down abroad.  I mean right here in our own country, we are in a state of war.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to look at dealing with the effects of feminism as just putting up with spoiled, entitled bitches and learning how to deal with their endless shit tests so you can get in their pants.  It is not some phase or fad that will eventually fade away.  You must recognize feminism for what it truly is: one of the arms of Communism, with its goals being to break up the nuclear family, effectively weaken the country from within, and to eradicate any form of masculinity or aggression, thereby reducing the number of people who can engage in dissent.</p>
<p>Remember, no matter what you call the system or ideology, be it fascist, totalitarian, communist, socialist, or dictatorial, the one thing they all have in common is the complete and utter annihilation of dissent.  In the words of <a href="http://www.monticello.org/site/jefferson/dissent-highest-form-patriotism-quotation">somebody</a>, <i>“Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.”</i>  The cornerstone of any truly free society is the right to openly and peacefully disagree with a prevailing idea, law, or policy without fear of reprisal.  Once the right to dissent is eliminated, freedom no longer exists.</p>
<h4><b><i>The WorldCom of Ideologies</i></b></h4>
<p>Now some of the younger readers might not be too familiar with the term Communism.  That’s because you know it as Socialism, Progressivism, Liberalism, or Social Democracy.  Same shit, different bull.   I don’t use any of these synonyms because, just as we should engage in fat-shaming and slut-shaming, we should engage in Commie-shaming.</p>
<p>One of the Left’s favorite tricks is <a href="http://youtu.be/mDBq-OU1rHo?t=1m58s">rebranding</a>.  Communism is still a bad word here in America, especially with the Baby Boomers that grew up during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mccarthyism">McCarthyism</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_scare">Red Scare</a> in the 50’s and 60’s.  So the Left refers to them only as “socialists” or “progressives” now, to disguise their true intentions.  Since the Boomers are approaching the twilight of their years and are slowly fading from political and cultural relevance, the Left can indoctrinate younger generations in the new nomenclature and in a sense effectively erase the negative association between the word Communism and its synonyms.</p>
<p>Another aspect of rebranding is a phenomenon known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideasthesia">Ideasthesia</a>, which is when certain sounds in a language are tied to ideas or perceptions.  For instance, it’s an “urban legend” in stand-up comedy circles that emphasizing and using words that contain <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yx5QxzSn1w">hard consonants</a> is funnier than using words with soft consonants.  The same could be said of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect">aggressive or negative perceptions</a>.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_xUIDRxdmc&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">Like with the</a> entire <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yWY-QkC3Co&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player">German language</a>.</p>
<p>Therefore, Communism, which starts with the hardest consonant sound, is a much more aggressive word than Socialism, which has none.  Ever wonder why the word <i>cunt</i> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=most+offensive+word+in+the+english+language&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.5256j0j9&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;oq=most+offensive+word+in+the+english+language&amp;gs_l=heirloom-serp.3...15336.18832.0.19016.24.11.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0.ckp%2Ckpns%3D1000...0...1.1.34.heirloom-serp..24.0.0.BneGlQEFC2c">is so much more offensive to American women than bitch, slut, or whore</a>?  It has the same meaning as <i>pussy, </i>and a woman (probably) won’t go nuclear if you call her that, so what’s the big deal?  It’s partly because it starts and ends with a hard consonant.  There is no nice way to say that word.  You could try it with a shit-eating grin on your face, and that would probably just make it worse.  Precede it with “fucking”, and you’ll achieve a glorious <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVuK44kWgxk">full feminist meltdown</a>.</p>
<h4><b><i>Yuri Bezmenov, The Great Prognosticator</i></b></h4>
<p>To really illustrate the connection between Communist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion">ideological subversion</a> and our current P.C.-saturated, equality-obsessed culture, I’d like you to meet Yuri Alexandrovich Bezmenov, who was a KGB operative for the Soviet Union in the 1960’s and who defected to the United States in 1970 when he became disillusioned with the Communist system.  Keep in mind that this interview was conducted in 1984, exactly <b><i><span style="text-decoration: underline;">30 years ago</span></i></b>.  The parallels between what he predicts and what is happening now are… disturbing.</p>

<h4><b><i>Sour Grapes</i></b></h4>
<p><b><i>4:30 – 8:17</i></b>  Yuri explains the difference between our free-market Capitalist society and a Communist one.  A common phrase heard by brainwashed Leftists is <i>“Well it really doesn’t matter what system you live under because they’re all the same: corrupt and run by tyrants.”  </i>This is the argumentative equivalent of sour grapes, aka being a <a href="http://www.flicksandbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/samuel-l-jackson-stephen-django-unchained.jpg">diabolical hater</a>, in game:</p>

<p><i>“That guy’s always with hot women while I’m by myself, but that’s only because he has money/fame/looks and </i><a href="http://cdn.arwrath.com/1/149084.gif"><i>I wouldn’t want to fuck those sluts anyway</i></a><i>” </i>translates to “<i>You’ve proven that my ideology is bullshit, but that’s only because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> ideologies are bullshit and there is no perfect system, including yours.  So suck it.”</i></p>
<p>True, there is no perfect system, and of course corruption will exist as long as there are human beings, therefore certain levels of corruption are to be expected in any society.  In order for good to exist, evil must also exist, since they are simply two sides of the same coin.  The difference is, by keeping moral values high and shaming bad behavior, a society can mitigate corruption and find a balance.</p>
<h4><b><i>America: Then…</i></b></h4>
<p>If you were able to cut the rampant racism from our Golden Era of 1950-1960 to even current levels of racial acceptance, in my mind you would have achieved as close to a utopia as you were going to get with the greatest system in the world, Free-Market Capitalism.</p>
<p>We built the greatest middle class and the greatest economy in the history of humanity.  A man was paid an honest day’s pay for an honest day’s work.  Our creativity, ingenuity, and ambition were unmatched while our women were feminine and content to stay home and do what they do best, which is rear children and take care of their families.  Homosexuality was treated like what it is: at worst a deviant perversion and at best a chromosomal aberration.  Either way, it wasn’t celebrated, and was tolerated as long as it stayed behind closed doors.</p>
<p>A man’s word was his bond.</p>
<p>The elite of this country understood that to have a prosperous nation, you had to have a strong middle class, a strong nuclear family, and strong moral values.  Workers were valued and had names, not just numbers.  As Yuri states, even our prisoners had rights. And while rights may be man-made ideas determined by the powerful, at least they were upheld and considered sacrosanct.</p>
<h4><b><i>…and now</i></b></h4>
<p>Compare the past to the present, and you’ll see that in a span of less than 50 years, creeping Communism has eroded all the hard work and sacrifice of our ancestors.  The middle class is all but extinct and our economy is a joke.  People want an honest day’s pay for no work at all.  Our populace is lazy, spoiled, arrogant, and fat, while we build nothing of value here anymore.</p>
<p>We all know what happened to our women.  Thanks to feminism, the <a href="http://images.moviepilot-cdn.com/single_moms_club_ver2-the-single-moms-club.jpeg?width=570&amp;height=880">nuclear family is gone</a> and homosexual perversion is not only deemed normal, but is now openly promoted, accepted, and forced on us.  Honor and integrity are now quaint remnants of a bygone era, existing only in small pockets of civilization.  Workers are basically drones or expendable cannon fodder, known more by their number designations than by their names.  If you are a man, the validity of your rights is determined by man-hating feminists and homosexuals and you are now guilty until proven innocent.  Long story short, we are inexorably headed towards the hell that Yuri describes.</p>
<h4><b><i>WTF Guys.  China?</i></b></h4>
<p><b><i>11:00 – 13:15 </i></b> It has been comprehensively covered on this site how <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/652/human-resources-is-your-master">American corporations are clearly promoting the P.C./Feminist agenda</a>.  Since we’ve established that the agenda is a Communist one, we’re basically shooting ourselves in the foot.  Here Yuri describes how we are making the same error that we made with the Soviets.  He points out how American corporations were nourishing the Communist system by making grain deals with the Russians.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today, and you see that almost everything in this country is made in China which, despite their relaxation on certain policies recently, is still a Communist country with a <a href="http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/china">deplorable human rights record</a>.  In other words, they treat their people like shit.</p>
<p><a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/moneymatters/ss/How-Much-US-Debt-Does-China-Own.htm">We owe China, a Communist country, over a trillion dollars in debt</a>.   When you don’t pay a debt, what happens?  The bank takes your house, car, or business, or some goon takes your kneecaps.  You don’t have to be an economist to understand that eventually China’s going to want their money.  We have a floundering economy that’s resulted in us raising our debt ceiling and having our credit rating dropped, and we owe what effectively amounts to a one-party totalitarian state with a rapidly expanding military over a trillion dollars.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kD6oseZN8s">Result</a>?</p>
<h4><b><i>The Great Egalitarian Socialist Utopia is a Pipe Dream</i></b></h4>
<p>Pay close attention to the words and phrases Yuri uses, and note how they correlate to the ones used in the West today.  He predicts that we’ll eventually end up like the Soviet Union, using a gulag system where we’ll work for free under the glorious system of “socialist equality.”  Sound familiar?  You can’t throw a rock in any direction in this country, including both up and down, without hitting some idiot screaming about equality.</p>
<p>This may be hard to swallow for some, but there is no such thing as equality.  Life isn’t fair.  Deal with it.  Strong/weak, beautiful/ugly, tall/short, smart/dumb, rich/poor—some people are just simply better than others.  It’s up to you, and you alone, to elevate yourself and overcome your shortcomings.</p>
<p>Leftists love erroneously pointing out that the constitution says all men are equal.  Wrong.  It says all men are <b><i>created</i></b> equal.  We all come into this world as drooling bundles of joy who are unable to take care of ourselves at first and must rely on others for survival.  Once we’re young adults, the race begins, and your success in this life will be determined by your merit and hard work.  True, some are born with greater economic advantages due to their parents’ wealth, but a lazy wealthy person cannot make the same accomplishments as a poor person with unlimited drive, ambition, and a never-give-up attitude.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://youtu.be/SZnkULuWFDg?t=26m18s">another highly recommended video</a> featuring our friend Yuri that breaks down step-by-step the process of ideological subversion, he verifies this claim.  <b><i>Equality must be earned, and cannot be given</i></b>.  The <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/8f/8feb4b8354e4b351f1898d7acf9dda3fe619791fc9e94bafeea751e4ee3c972b.jpg">Leftist hamster cannot accept this</a>.  They would rather drag the strong down to their level at the bottom than improve themselves and rise to the top.</p>
