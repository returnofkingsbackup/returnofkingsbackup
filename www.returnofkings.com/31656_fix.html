<p>In the 1980s, there were personal ads. This required a woman to come up with a few sentences about herself, contact a newspaper or magazine and pay for the ad, wait for her phone to ring, agree to a date, meet the man, and then make a determination of her level of attraction to him. Let’s say only 1% of the female population would go through the efforts of placing a print ad.</p>
<p>In the 1990s the internet came along. Sites like Yahoo Personals made it a bit easier to place an online ad for the woman seeking a companion. Aside from the online medium, it was relatively the same as the print ad. With the ability to email, the man and woman could exchange pictures online after dialing in to AOL or another service provider prior to meeting. We can assume the ease of the internet raised the participation level of females to using this medium to 5%.</p>
<p>In 1995 Match.com was born and eventually became very popular. Girls would have to set up a profile, write about themselves, pay a monthly fee and then either contact others with a message, or wait to be contacted by a man who searched out their profile and initiated a conversation. Let’s put forth an educated guess of about 20% of the dating female market used Match.com or something similar.</p>
<p>Eventually in the 2000s sites came along like Okcupid and PlentyOfFish, which required even less effort. No payment needed, easier to search through and message people, and so on. As these online mediums became more accepted, so did its usage. My incredibly scientific research pins the market usage at 40%.</p>
<p>The latest evolution is Tinder. This application requires the least amount of effort one can imagine. After you upload some of your photos, girls can just sit there and tap yes or no (or swipe left or right) to indicate if they like a particular male or not. No information, interests, hobbies or other personal details are revealed. Ask any single and dating girl about Tinder and she’s almost guaranteed to have heard of it, and probably uses it.</p>
<h4>Tinder’s Effects On Girls</h4>
<p>Girls now have the ability to be instantly validated. They can have endless attention by just opening an app on their iPhones. Whereas before they would have to be hit on in person, or open the website to see their messages on Match.com, or even the apps for OKC or PlentyOfFish to see what messages they got, now they literally sit there like robots tapping the screen of their phone for the same thing.</p>

<p>Countless times when I’m out at a bar, eating lunch, on the subway, walking the streets I see girls on Tinder. They just tap, tap, tap, tap and are oblivious their surroundings. During this past Superbowl, I was at a sports bar and saw groups of girls there drinking, on their phones, and not watching the game or talking to each other. Just tapping.</p>
<p>On the plus side, if you are looking for easy sex Tinderellas are pretty damn slutty. So while I do fault the app for creating this lack of effort on the part of women, I will admit that it has made it very easy as a male to find sex. Tap, text, bang.</p>

<h4>Tinder IS America</h4>
<p>As the title of this post suggests, Tinder captures the state of America today. We are a nation that has sacrificed all efforts for comforts, values for ease. Guys and girls both can now avoid going out and meeting people the old-fashioned way and just sit at home and tap tap tap. It’s mindless and develops no social skills in the individual.</p>
<p>Idiocracy was a movie from 2006 that alluded to our cultural state today. While housed in jest and comedy, there are some disturbing similarities beginning to surface:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the 21st century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Most science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down. How did this happen? Evolution does not necessarily reward intelligence. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left the intelligent to become an endangered species.</p>
<p>The years passed, mankind became stupider at a frightening rate. Some had high hopes the genetic engineering would correct this trend in evolution, but sadly the greatest minds and resources where focused on conquering hair loss and prolonging erections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reality TV. Seamless. Tinder. Everything is designed for us to just sit around or minimize our mental activity, or both. It’s scary and sad at the same time.</p>
<h4>Tinderfessions</h4>
<p>This twitter handle, <a href="https://twitter.com/tinderfessions">Tinderfessions</a>, brings us the anonymous confessions of various Tinder users. If you’ve ever doubted how slutty girls are, or how much they seek quick validation, this should give you a view into the real state of American girls these days. Here are some choice ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Record for how many Tinder guys I’ve hooked up with in one day: 8 – Robin</p>
<p>I like to swipe right on guys who are friends with my brother, they come over to hangout w/him &amp; don’t leave until they’ve fucked me – Kylie</p>
<p>I have had tinder for about 5 days now and I have over 400 matches and I have fucked four guys already – Janet</p>
<p>2109 matches and still going strong. I’ve never met one of them in person and I plan on keeping it that way. – Kate</p>
<p>Tinder guys are clingy…I just wanna fuck &amp; move onto the next one. – Julia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We’ve discussed ad nauseam here and other places how while quick and fast sex is great, it comes at a cost to civilization as a whole. Tinder is just another step towards the degradation of society here in America. I can’t imagine how things can get simpler than just tapping, but there is always something.</p>
