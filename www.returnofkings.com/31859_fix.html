<p>Last month, a woman was <a href="http://jalopnik.com/womans-horniness-causes-plane-to-make-emergency-landin-1519959068">arrested on Delta Airlines flight 1189</a> that was bound from Baltimore to Salt Lake City, Utah.  Like any sane, fun person would do, she had a few drinks prior to boarding the airplane.  As is often found, females tend to be very sexually promiscuous once under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>So what did the dashing young lady do once she had her fill of liquid courage in the form of vodka cranberries?</p>
<p>She hit on her fellow passenger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-textannotation-id="ed8a6488310e69bda04c5aa3fff212b5">A Delta flight from Baltimore-Washington to Salt Lake City — widely considered America’s two sexiest metro areas and the corridor between them is usually thought of as the Bermuda Triangle of Arousal — was the setting for the attempted sexytime that went so very, very wrong.</p>
<p data-textannotation-id="c391f87d3d818e4b14c52513209d2d81">The woman, who was described as “very intoxicated” reportedly made several sexual advances to her male seatmate, who refused. This allegedly made the woman intensely angry, as you’d expect from almost any drunk, horny, sexually aggressive citizen. As you can hear in the video, she then became loud and abusive, threatening to “fucking kill” the man, and then once she was restrained with handcuffs, things got even worse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the in-field video of her seduction:</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/YRSdc9Ypykc.html" height="315" width="420" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Notice the confident opener, aggressive body language, and willingness to push past the resistance in order to get a close.  I give her an A+.</p>
<p>Except, this video was taken <i>after </i>the male victim had already turned down her advances.  This was her reaction – and I swear, I’ve seen the same exact scene play out in the grocery store – when a parent turns down a five-year-old’s consistent badgering for a donut.</p>
<p>She was so out of control that the pilots on flight 1189 were forced to divert to Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Here is the video of authorities escorting her off of the plane.  Before you wonder why they’re taking the male victim off of the plane, look a little closer.  Or, you could, you know, vomit.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/8OR0BbcfHyc.html" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>There’s no sense in wasting time debating whether she is a man or woman – for all intents and purposes, it is a female.  Now, let’s re-write this story with a male seducer:</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script data-cfasync="false" src="cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<p><i>A man was arrested last night on Delta flight 1189 from Baltimore to Salt Lake City.  Once on board, he ordered a Jack and Coke for the flight.  He was flirting with the passenger next to him. After flirting with her for an hour, he asked for her number.  She responded in a shrill tone, saying that she wasn’t interested.  The male flight attendant, upon noticing that a female passenger was facing unwanted advances, immediatley intervened, handcuffing him to the back flight attendant seat for the remainder of the flight.  Upon landing, the aggressor was questioned by police and a restraining order was put on him.</i></p>
<p>While this fictional story may be a little absurd, we all know that if we directly substituted a male for our lesbian dyke in these videos, he’d end up in jail, and probably not just overnight.</p>
<p>The real lesson to be taken from the story is not what the media portrays, which is that of a drunk, horny woman who lost control of her sexual impulses.  No, the real lesson to be learned is that women can simply not handle sexual rejection.  They are so used to dozens of thirsty men fawning all over them that when they actually stick their necks out and get the door slammed in their face, they go batshit insane.  It is a blow that their psyches are simply incapable of handling.</p>
<p>I know from personal experience, and I’m sure many other readers can attest to this, as well.  Turning a girl down for sex absolutely infuriates them.  Of course, the mainstream media would never mention that you can <i>completely use this to your advantage.</i></p>
<p>For starters, your self confidence.  Turning a woman down puts you in the seat of power, and gives you a cocky demeanor.  It signals to you that you don’t need this particular woman, because you are already satisfied with what you have.  It knocks them right off of the precious pedestal.  Every man should reject a sexually aggressive woman at least once in their lifetime just to see what it feels like.</p>
<p>Two, even if you have slept with the girl already, or are even in a relationship, turning a girl down for sex is a great way to instill a little dread.  It will make her wonder if she is doing enough to keep you, which will result in her putting more effort into pleasing you.  I recently turned down my girlfriend’s sexual advances in a non-direct way – basically by just passing out.  Her reaction in the morning was priceless.</p>
<p>A relationship is most healthy when there are opposite polarities – you are the king and she is Cinderella – not the princess version, mind you – the servant.  Perhaps though, if this sexually aggressive woman on flight 1189 looked more like Cinderella and less like a dyke, we wouldn’t even be having this discussion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, judging by the fact that there were no prominent follow-up stories on this situation, I’d wager that the approacher got off with a slap on the wrist.   It’s a shame it’s a slap on the ass that she really wanted.</p>
<p>She should have flown on <i>United</i> instead.</p>
