<p>There is a commenter named Mark Minter who is dropping anti-marriage bombs all over the manosphere. His first hall of fame comment comes <a href="http://donlak.wordpress.com/2012/09/03/get-married/comment-page-1/#comment-3047">via Donlak</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the most ridiculous logic I have heard. To call someone a pussy that counsels not to get married because of the risk is blowhard bullshit. You have a 1 in 1,000,000 chance of dying when you leave the house. You have 1 in 2 chance of divorce. 1 in 2. My opinion and observation of data is that your odds are higher if you marry someone attractive. Higher still if you were a player. So go to a roulette wheel and bet 40% of all of your future income on the red or the black. Same thing. It depends on your definition of Game. Some say Game is proactive and allows you to get the best out of life. I think it is somewhat reactive. I say it is defensive. Game enables you to avoid Oneitis and to make sane and rational decisions, to not be dragged, tricked, or manipulated into marriage.</p>
<p>You ever been married for 17 years? I have. I know what it is like. I know the boredom you will experience. I know what it is like to be chained to a career that is not your choosing because of the financial pressures placed on you. I am a expert at mid 19th Russian history because my fucking wife went to bed early for 10 years. Ask me how much mid 19th century Russian history I have read since divorce. None. I spent this weekend watching every college game on TV.</p>
<p>The odds are you probably will end up divorced. You don’t know how to be married. You think you do and you think that Game might help to avoid divorce. Fuck off. The only way you will stay married is if she has no better alternative to you. And if you have no balls. If you are a nice little handyman, if you stand around and hold her coat and let her direct the movie, then she might just let you keep on being her slave. All this talk about Game saving you from divorce is pretty recent and to me, mighty suspect with what I know about being married. My opinion is that if you are a lion, then you will be divorced. If you are a mouse then you might be divorced. You have to toe the line of what women think is the “good dad” and you will have to subordinate yourself to the woman’s definition of the “greater good”. Both me and my brother-in-law were faced with a situation where both of us had vetted wives based on the fact that they would work. “Sure. Sure. We love to work. We’re modern women”. Then when the kids came both wives quit or got fired. They were both faced with some tough situations at work and both sat down. “My baby needs me.” Fuck that. She didn’t work anymore and used the convenient justification. Both, my brother-in-law and I freaked out. Both women felt absolutely justified. “People change. When I said I would work, I didn’t know the reality of how much I would want to be with my child.” You can say same about a ton of things, where you live, how much money is acceptable, how big a house. Also, my wife was supposed to inherit about 7 million dollars from her dad and then the dad re-married, out of the blue, right before he died, and the new wife took a great chunk of that money when the will was changed. My ex-wife figured, hey a few million isn’t enough for two people to live on so it is in her advantage to ditch this guy before her dad died.</p>
<p>Fine, marriage might work out for you. It probably won’t and you will fuck yourself bad. It happens to 1 in 2 men. 1 in fucking 2.</p>
<p>This might be the first time I have read this blog and I don’t know man, but I certainly will filter anything you might write after this. This is pure hyper macho “Real alphas aren’t afraid to marry”. Fine, get a revolver, but 3 bullets in it, spin the chamber, and put it to your head. Same thing, buddy. 1 in 2 man.</p>
<p>The essence of modern divorce law is that it changes the classical trade of surplus labor for sex. Once anyone can receive the benefit from any deal without supplying their part then you can bet your ass that they will use the situation to their advantage. Dalrock wrote last week that the modern church preaches that it is the duty of the woman to withhold sex to coerce her husband into acting “right” as she defines “right” to be. Fairness never enters into it. “He won’t go to Home Depot with me because I want to change all the light switches in the house because I don’t like them and he wants to watch stupid football instead”. That’s justification enough for her to withhold sex. Or “I’m too tired. I have my job and the kids.” or any 100s of reasons that the hamster will use to justify it and you can do nothing to keep it from happening. So then when she has starved you out for 6 months and then you look at porn after hours and hours of being alone, then “Aha, he looks a porn and I am justified in divorcing him”. The law gives the woman undue advantage legally and you are hoping she will listen to her better angels and not take advantage.</p>
<p>It not a lack of courage. It is prudentiality. You examine the rewards and you consider the risk as well as the potential loss. And just because you have read four blogs that say game your wife and she won’t leave you is not enough to make me forget that millions of men are tossed out into the street every year. You can read all you want about trading in Forex and think you are just the shit on trading the JPY-EUR pair and then lose your ass. Prudentiality or prudence, however you want to look at it, will allow to know a bad risk when you see it. Courage has nothing to do with judgement.</p>
<p>Your kidding yourself if you think you can eliminate risk by looking at age, education, parental history, and a bunch of factors. The only safe way is to not marry. And it is not a coward’s way out. You will be happier in the end when you are 55, 60, 70. I have been alone for two years now at 57. The lack of stress, of not having a bitch, of no abuse, of no arguments, no Home Depot, no stupid female bullshit is tremendous. My dad never remarried after my mom died. They fought for years throughout the whole marriage and she slept alone in another room for about 5 years before she died. No one was more Alpha then him. He partied a bit and she was always on his ass about it. Once she accused him of having a girlfriend and he said “Evelyn, you may not have cured me of drinking, but you damn sure cured me of women.” And he meant it. After she died, he never even had a girlfriend.</p>
<p>We all thought “Gosh, he must be lonely” He fucking wasn’t. He had ample money to do as he pleased and he did exactly that. I didn’t really know how happy he was to not have 5 kids up his ass all wanting something from him and a bitch on his back all the time. Until I did it.</p>
<p>He had sort of been a role model for me. I surely wanted to wait to marry, to not have a lot of kids, because even as a boy I figured out he was getting the shit end of the stick. I should have paid even better attention and never married.</p>
<p>Sure, when your in your 30s and early 40s, people will think there is something fucked with you because they all think old school, if you were worth a shit then a woman would want you or you would “man up”.</p>
<p>You have to leave all that bullshit thinking behind. Like it or not, this is a new era in mankind. Marriage is and will continue to be the first casualty of PostModernism.</p>
<p>You know what. I am going exactly the other direction from you. You are a pussy if you do marry. You are a coward that is falling for conditioning, that you need the social validation of it, that you are afraid that you will be alone when you are old, that you need to follow what you are told to do and man-up and meet your responsibilities, that you are afraid to stick your nose out there and continue to struggle to get what you want from women and from the world and you want a bitch to tell you what to do, that you are such a fucking wimp that you need a woman so you can lay your head on her chest and seek your mother like you were a little baby infant (Coco Chanel’s word about men, not mine).</p>
<p>Pussy.</p>

<p>I was reading the Red Pill Blog (It’s a very good blog if you have never read it. I highly recommend his article on The Female Social Matrix. It is very long. Here is a link to it:<a href="http://theredpillroom.blogspot.com/2012/05/female-social-matrix-introduction.html" rel="nofollow">http://theredpillroom.blogspot.com/2012/05/female-social-matrix-introduction.html</a> ). The writer is another guy that has been married for 21 years. One of his articles says you can’t be alpha part of the time. His wife says “Foreplay begins in the morning when your feet hit the floor after you wake up” He begins this list of things you should do:</p>
<p>That means being the leader every day.<br>
That means being decisive in your leadership every day.<br>
That means soliciting her opinions before you make a decision about something important, every day.<br>
That means ensuring the health, safety, and welfare for your family every day.<br>
That means household maintenance every day.<br>
That means working out in some way, every day.<br>
That means making at least three good DHV Alpha moves every day.<br>
That means intriguing her sense of curiosity or wonder every day.<br>
That means making her come to you, not the other way around, every day.</p>
<p>And this is just a fragment of his list and I started thinking after reading about a third of the way through it, “Fuck it”. It’s such a load of shit to go through just to be with a woman. You just can’t “be” with one. There is always going to be this tension that you are going to be put through in one form or another. You either are the perfect little beta with a side of alpha that is the best little handyman or you have to now go through this contrived alpha shit that Ian Ironwood lists above.</p>
<p>its such a lot of shit to go through just to have some regular pussy. That’s not really even regular and it gets real tired. It is far better to fuck new pussy then your old tired ass wife and look that crap you have to go through to even get that.</p>
<p>And none of it is guaranteed to work and most of this is just conjecture. A few married guys that a “her-i-cane” hasn’t made “landfall” into his life and his marriage are like people living in Orlando telling people in southern Alabama how best to avoid a hurricane. Just because a major hurricane hasn’t hit Orlando doesn’t mean one won’t ever hit there.</p>
<p>I am 57. I am divorced. I live without a woman. I was sad and mad for about four years after the divorce. But now, not a day fucking goes by that I am not actually thankful that I don’t have that woman in my life. I don’t mean just a little bit thankful. I mean I am fucking giddy about it. Being happy is fucking easy. All you have to do to be happy is not be unhappy. I can’t really tell you how to be happy but I can fucking tell you how to be unhappy. Have a 55 year old wife. That’s how.</p>
<p>There are 3 women in their late forties or fifties that all three live right next to each other, right by me. I look at them and I am so glad I don’t have one of these beasts in my bed. My mother died way before my father and he never went with another woman. It wasn’t any devotion to her. He hated her. He was sick of her. She harangued and henpecked him for 40 or years. And he was alpha as mother fucker and he had all those good beta qualities of regularity and dependability that a woman could want in a man. He was 6’3″ 220 pound Sergeant-Major in the military that was about the meanest looking mother fucker you would see every week. He had a command voice that would freeze children in their tracks. I would run into his young troopers on the base when I was a teenager and when they found out who I was they would say “Your dad is a mean fucking asshole”. I would reply “You’re telling me something I don’t know. I’m his fucking son. Try that on for a while.” But no matter what, how alpha you are or what good alpha/beta mix you are there is still going to be something that is going to put a burr in that woman’s saddle. He was a good man and a good husband and still they ended up sleeping in different rooms.</p>
<p>All this ink and writing about how to be some alpha with some beta in you or a beta with some alpha in you is a fucking waste of time. There is no solution to this. Women and men are too far apart and there is no reconciliation. They have opinions that are rationalized, solipsistic, false, or generalized. They have the advantageous position of having a pussy that you want more than they want your dick, and they have the law, religion, and the media on their side. The highest rate of divorce is among interracial marriages of white woman and black men. And you know those relationships are the best example of women wanting to marry alpha dick and that is the only reason that the woman married the man.</p>
<p>Get it through your head, Men are from mars; women are FUCKING IDIOTS.</p>
<p>Never marry. Duh. Plate Theory. Duh. Game. Duh. Pump them, dump them, next them. Duh. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO WIN. Duh!!!!!</p>
<p>You have no idea how young you are going to feel when you are 57 and how old those women will be when they are 57. You will not feel a lick of shit older or different when you are 57. Your dick will work, your body will work. You will still be viable sexually. And that women will be a broken down piece of shit with a dead vagina and a body that would disgust you to see her naked much less fuck her. My ex-wife would be 50 years old right now and I have no idea how I could actually bring myself to fuck her knowing how she probably looks without clothes right now. Women say old men are pervs for wanting to fuck young girls. Fuck I would think it is perverted to fuck old women. It is natural as a motherfucker to want to fuck young women. Duh.</p>
<p>You can’t fucking win at this game. Get a fucking PS3. Get DirectTV. Get a lot of guy friends. Go fishing. Get some kind of Game be it alpha game or beta game to make them think you will be their sucker provider and then run away after you get the trim.</p>
<p>Whatever, just never marry. I am starting to get bored with this theme, how to be a better husband by being more alpha.</p>
<p>It won’t work.</p>
<p>You cannot look at a 40 year old women today and say that today’s thirty year old will be just like that when she is 40. You can’t even look at a 30 year old today and say today’s 20 year old will be like her. You have no idea what any of them are going to be like when they get older. The only reason women stayed with men in the past was because they had to and now they don’t and they won’t. Maybe if you are in the top 10% of income and your wife doesn’t work then she might stay with you.</p>
<p>There was this piece in The Atlantic a few days ago called “The Weaker Sex”. It profiled 3 women as something the female writer called the DWP club, divorced women professionals. It profiled 4 women, three were already divorced and loving it. They had fucking weekends off from kids. The Ex husbands came and got the kids. So they had female nirvana, money, independence, nobody trying to fuck them, and someone else to raise the kids on the weekends. The fourth had a househusband, who she fucking abused, and the writer made him look like a nitwit idiot and hinted this woman was well on the way to getting a divorce. All made mid six figure incomes. Women will only stay with you if they have to and they don’t have to any fucking more. Get it through your head. They get just as sick of your dick as you will with their tired ass boring pussy.</p>
<p>Pump them, dump them, next them.</p>
<p>If you do this, if you never marry, and they invent time machines in the next 30 years, your 57 year old self will fucking come back and thank you for doing it. If you don’t listen to me, then your 57 will come back and say “Listen to me you little idiot, when you meet a blond woman named Suzanne from Long Island, New York, RUN!!!!!”</p>

<p>He has been getting criticisms about <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-16629-post-283614.html#pid283614">being bitter</a>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think he said some great red pill info, but he sounds so bitter.</p>
<p>Women can be wonderful creatures, as well as nightmares also, I spent such good moments with them, also non considering sex and romance, I can’t agree with all the things Mark Minter says.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget this, because enjoying women it’s part of a player and should be part of everyone’s life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bitter or not, I like his comments because he has been through the trenches. He speaks from experience and for that I think we should at least consider his warnings against marriage.</p>
