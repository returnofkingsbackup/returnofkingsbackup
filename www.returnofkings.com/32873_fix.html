<p><i>“Once you date an Asian girl, you will never go back.” </i>Men often hear something similar to this from other men who have dated Asian women, meaning women directly from Asia, not American women of Asian descent. This is important because American women can be completely obnoxious and entitled. When an American-born Asian women  behaves in that manner, it is actually tenfold more annoying.</p>
<p>Living in Hawaii, I am surrounded by Asian and American women. So I have tried to take advantage of this and go out on dates—if you can still call them that—with Asian women as well as American women. I immediately noticed stark differences in the way they conduct themselves.</p>
<h4><em>Pre Date</em></h4>
<p>Arranging the date is far easier with Asian women. The Asian woman <i>listens</i> and happily accommodates with any recommendations. She is just glad to be in your company and whatever plans you make are almost irrelevant to simply being with you.</p>
<p>The American women is indecisive, whiny and wants you to make all the decisions.  If you offer up something she does not approve of she will say so, but not offer any alternatives, not to mention the 30%  chance she will flake all together.  As a man, you are already annoyed with her but you move forward with the date anyway.</p>
<h4><em>Appearance</em></h4>
<p>In Hawaii things are naturally quite casual, but for a first date you still step up your dress a little. At least some jeans and a button up. This is Hawaii, again, and unless you have been here you have no idea how casual it is. George Clooney said it best in The Descendents,  <em>“Some of the most powerful people in Hawaii look like bums and stunt men”. </em>However<em>, </em> Asian women will actually tend to overdress a bit. But when she opens her door in a nice sundress, hair and makeup done in a subtle but striking manner, combined with the pleasant aroma produced by her favorite perfume or body spray, you are fine with it. You feel good knowing she put forth effort to look good for you, for herself and doing so in tasteful way. You are proud to have her on your arm.</p>
<p>Your American date meets you at the bar or in the parking lot of her condo. If she dressed up at all it is in a dress too tight and too short for anyone not earning meth money on a street corner. She has on so much makeup that Bozo the Clown would be resentful. In Hawaii she will usually just show up with her hair pulled back in a ponytail. Maybe some jean shorts a size too small and a tank top or t-shirt with a bra that shoves her tits up into her throat. Revealing much more while simultaneously making her less attractive. Sure, you want to bang her, but that is all.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<h4><em>Conversation</em></h4>
<p>So begins the general conversation one would expect to engage in on a first date. For an Asian women this means listening and politely asking questions, while showing a genuine interest. Again, she is sincerely happy to be in your presence and is actually quite enthralled. She doesn’t interrupt or make judgmental comments. She wants to know more about <i>you</i>, not your income or how you can benefit <i>her</i>. She will drink  water, maybe a martini or craft beer you recommend.  Conversation is pleasant and she answers all your questions with a refreshing authenticity.</p>
<p>The American woman immediately orders a draft beer or maybe a shot of Jameson. At the very least the latest trendy drink, perhaps a mojito. She wants to talk about her and only her. When you talk about yourself, she interrupts and somehow still makes it about her. Negative comments pepper the conversation like <i>“I can’t stand my roommate, she is such a bitch”</i> or <i>“My job sucks, everyone is a bunch of assholes.”</i> All this while texting friends and checking Facebook every three minutes. By the end of dinner she is bombed and semi-belligerent, swiping’ spoonfuls of desert off your plate after she said she was full and didn’t want her own. She will make the obligatory “<i>let me pay</i>” gesture. But we know she never intended to anyway. Only thing she brought was her ID, iPhone and some backup birth control.</p>
<h4><em>After Dinner Antics</em></h4>
<p>We come to the end of the date and as you walk the Asian women back to the car, you find yourself with her arm hooked around yours and you are opening her car door for her. Not because you feel obligated to do so, but because you actually <i>want</i> to. She deserves to be treated well, and you reciprocate. You may end up getting coffee somewhere and then drop her off back home. Maybe a kiss, maybe not. But you are okay with it because it was a pleasure to be out with her, you feel content. She expresses her gratitude for the evening, so much so it is almost uncomfortable. When you get home you find a text on your phone thanking you again. A delightful experience.</p>
<p>The American women will often request you go out to do more drinking and bar hopping, even inviting friends. If you just want to get laid, you go along with it. Not saying it isn’t fun, it can be.  You end up in some dive bar and she hammers down more Fireball shots on your tab. Maybe she lunges at you in the bar and you end up in a full make out session right there, perhaps more. Classy? No, but still fun. You end up going back to her place and she may or may not invite you in for some easy sex. If not it is only because she wants to appear like she has a sliver of class. It’s all an act because you will be balls deep on next date, no question. No gratitude, no “<em>thank you”</em> text messages. Just an entitled attitude because this is what all men do for her. It was a fun date, sure. But you have little to no respect for her and any chance of her coming to the company Christmas bash went right down the toilet, the same place her head now rests.</p>
<p>Asians win. Flawless victory.</p>
