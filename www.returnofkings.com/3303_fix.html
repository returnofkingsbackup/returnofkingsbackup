<p>The NY Times, ever on top of American culture with their n=4 sample sizes, recently published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/fashion/the-end-of-courtship.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">The End Of Courtship</a>. Highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The word ‘date’ should almost be stricken from the dictionary,” Ms. Silver said. “Dating culture has evolved to a cycle of text messages, each one requiring the code-breaking skills of a cold war spy to interpret.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“I’ve seen men put more effort into finding a movie to watch on Netflix Instant than composing a coherent message to ask a woman out,” said Anna Goldfarb, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>34</strong></span>, an author and blogger in Moorestown, N.J. A typical, annoying query is the last-minute: “Is anything fun going on tonight?” More annoying still are the men who simply ping, “Hey” or “ ’sup.”</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>…the median income for young, single, childless women is higher than it is for men in many of the country’s biggest cities (though men still dominate the highest-income jobs, according to James Chung, the company’s president).  This may be one reason it is not uncommon to walk into the hottest new West Village bistro on a Saturday night and find five smartly dressed young women dining together — the nearest man the waiter. Income equality, or superiority, for women muddles the old, male-dominated dating structure.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>After an evening when she exchanged flirtatious glances with a bouncer at a Williamsburg nightclub, the bouncer invited her and her friends back to his apartment for whiskey and boxed macaroni and cheese. <strong>When she agreed</strong>, he gamely hoisted her over his shoulders, and, she recalled, “carried me home, my girlfriends and his bros in tow, where we danced around a tiny apartment to some MGMT and Ratatat remixes.”</p>

<p>She spent the night at the apartment, which kicked off a cycle of <strong>weekly hookups</strong>, invariably preceded by a Thursday night text message from him saying, ‘hey babe, what are you up to this weekend?” (It petered out after four months.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot can be said of this article but there is one point everyone, male and females, must understand: desirable men will not date in a way that punishes their dick. If sending text messages with “Hey” didn’t work, if inviting girls for “weekly hookups” or mac n’ cheese didn’t work, then the highest quality men of any society <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/you-did-this-to-me">simply wouldn’t do it</a>. If we were to listen to these girls and apply more courtship rituals to our game, what would happen? We wouldn’t get laid! The girls would construe it as needy and overbearing.</p>
<p>Women can change the dating game for the entire country in just one month. If every woman in America decided to simultaneously refuse aloof advances alphas, and instead fuck men who only took them out to dinner, called them daily, and complimented their appearance, the result would be obvious. Even if you are the most alpha of alpha in your crew, you would be wining and dining girls like a simp to get vagina if that was the only way to score. But that’s not what the women want. They want the Skittles man and they want the man who texts like he has a 6th grade education. And as long as they prefer that, that’s all they’ll get.</p>
