<p>One characteristic of a masculine man is the quality of fearlessness. What does this mean exactly, and how does one attain such a quality? Fearlessness does not mean being stupid or reckless. It doesn’t mean trying to walk across a busy freeway with the excuse “I am fearless”. Retarded reality TV shows nowadays try to paint fearlessness as being a reckless moron.</p>
<p>In the ultimate sense, the fear of death is the greatest fear. If we can overcome that fear, then naturally we will be able to conquer all lesser fears. There is a reason why Tyler Durden told his friend in Fight Club that he needs to give up the fear of death because by doing so, he would be free to do anything.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free.”<br>
― Jim Morrison</p></blockquote>

<p>This is turn brings us to the question of, what is the self. The fear of death is the fear that our individual selves will cease, our individual consciousness will cease into nothingness. Although science has not yet proven that there is a soul, there have been hundreds if not thousands of books written about near death experiences, that any unbiased person will accept that our consciousness lives on in an astral body after the death of the physical body.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you are not afraid of dying, there is nothing you cannot achieve.<br>
-Lao Tzu</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, Eastern religions and new age spirituality, in the West at least, is plagued and infected mostly with beta types of men as well as liberal feminist women. But these eastern religions like Hinduism or Buddhism are not liberal at their root. You can go to Asia or India and see for yourself—Hindus and Buddhists are conservative people. It is unfortunate that so many men who subscribe to eastern spirituality in the West are manginas because this turns off masculine men from such philosophies.</p>

<p>I’ve found the most success personally by avoiding organized religious groups and just studying eastern philosophy books by myself, and thus I’m able to avoid the liberal interpretation that most Westerners apply to such philosophies. Wherever there is an organization of any kind, there will always be women, and thus such organizations will always be a watered down version of the truth, if not promoting outright falsehoods.</p>
<p>The ancient books of the East such as The Teachings of the Buddha, the Tao Ching, the Bhagavad-Gita, and the Vedas help us overcome fear by reminding us the truth about how transient life really is, how insignificant we truly are. Fear is primarily a function of the ego and these ancient scriptures and books shatter our ego by teaching us that we are basically just a grain of sand in a massive universe. Even if one conquers the entire world, they’ll be forgotten within a few thousand years. That’s not to say that we should not try to become men of greatness but to achieve that first we have to achieve greatness within.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sage.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-33044" alt="Sage" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sage.jpg" width="518" height="316" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sage.jpg 800w, wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Sage-700x426.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 518px) 100vw, 518px"></a></p>
<p>Spirituality can also help us develop a mood of detachment. By reminding us of how insignificant our existence really is, we can cultivate a mood of detachment and aloofness. With such a mood of detachment, one no longer takes everything so personally because one is trying to not identify with their own ego anymore. Having a mood of detachment and aloofness will help you in most areas of your life as well.</p>
<p>Power comes from within. This is the masculine propensity. The female propensity, on the other hand, is that they want to be GIVEN power by someone else. And that is where eastern spirituality and metaphysics can help us. They guide us to conquer the self, and then you are truly capable of doing anything. That is basically what enlightenment is. In the days of old, such noble goals like the attainment of enlightenment was followed by many men and this produced men of noble quality. Men found strength from within, instead of trying to get validation from the external world.</p>
