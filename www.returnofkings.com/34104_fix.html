<p><em>“You Stay Classy San Diego” – </em>Ron Burgundy</p>
<p>Much like most of America, the ladies of San Diego <em>hardly </em>keep it classy these days.  Of course, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Less class equals more sex, and girls give sex out more freely than ever, though only to a handful of guys.  San Diego is one of those cutthroat cities – where, if you have your shit together, getting laid can be as simple as shooting fish in a barrel.  However, competition can definitely be tough, and I would never recommend anyone move here for the girls, regardless of how *incredibly* difficult it is to have to cope with 70 degree weather 10 months a year.</p>
<p>If you want to move, or take a vacation, to San Diego, here are some tips to get you started.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/san-diego-state-alpha-phis-10.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34108" alt="san-diego-state-alpha-phis-10" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/san-diego-state-alpha-phis-10.jpg"></a></p>
<h3>The “Man Diego” Name Rings True</h3>
<p>San Diego is often referred to as “Man Diego”, and it is commonly said that the only rain we get is “when it rains men.”  You know that moment when you walk into a bar, and you see twice as many guys as girls?  Many of you often grumble at the site, and curse yourself for going out that night.  In San Diego it’s not that uncommon to walk into a venue and see <i>four or</i><em> five</em> guys for every <em>one</em> girl.</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly – <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>4/5:1</strong></span></p>
<p>The reason for this:</p>
<h3>The Military Presence Is Huge</h3>
<p>There are some 7 bases within 15 miles of each other in the actual city of San Diego, plus Camp Pendleton only 30 miles up the road in Oceanside.  To illustrate my point, I’ve included the below snapshot.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/military.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34109" alt="military" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/military.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This means that there are drunken Navy and Marine boys running around all the time.  They often have quite a bit of money to blow because they live in the barracks and therefore have no living expenses.  While they don’t have game, the sheer number of them means that girls get endless attention, drinks, and as a result their bitch shields are often sky-high.  In addition to that, they are all in good shape.  While good fitness will not make up for a total lack of game, if <em>you</em> are not in good shape then it simply makes you look worse in a sea of cock.</p>

<h3>The Stupid SoCal Girl Vibe Is <em>True</em>
</h3>
<p><em></em>The dumb “like, OH MY GOD!!!” mentality that you always hear about beach girls is very much true.  Many girls here are incapable of thoughtful conversation, iPhone-obsessed, and have the attention span of a child.  However, don’t let this dissuade you; dumb girls are often quite easy.</p>

</div>
<p>So far I’ve highlighted some of the downsides of the city, but let’s end on a positive note, shall we?</p>
<h3>There Are A Lot Of Quality Girls</h3>
<p>Yes, the numbers with other guys are shitty, but remember that the population of San Diego is well over a million people.  Many girls are in good shape, athletic, and are in general, good-looking.  The city overall is very active due to the year-round gorgeous weather, which means that many people pride themselves on keeping themselves in top beach shape year round.  Of course, this also depends on where you go.  If you wander into the suburbs of Poway, you’ll find your fair share of fat single moms.  Stick to the coastal areas and you will be able to find slim and attractive girls.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/APhi-Honeys1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-34112" alt="APhi-Honeys1" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/APhi-Honeys1.jpg" width="291" height="218"></a></p>
<h3>Diversity</h3>
<p>Mexicans?  You’re 20 minutes from Tijuana.  Asians?  Hit up UCSD. Slutty sorority white girls?  Head towards SDSU.  European Au Pairs are all over the place.  San Diego is a like a buffet where you can sample a bit of everything.  If you’re foreign, girls will just drop their panties.  I had a friend from Australia who came over for some work training for two months.  He abused the shit out of his accent, and enjoyed himself, to say the least.</p>
<h3>Tourism Is High, Especially On Spring Break And Summer</h3>
<p>It’s easy to meet girls that are vacationing here who will fuck you.  After all, they’re on vacation and just want some fun, therefore it “doesn’t count.”</p>
<h3>Daygame Is An Untapped Market</h3>
<p>95% of guys here have terrible game.  As mentioned, it is mostly drunken Navy and Army boys making laughable approaches and blowing money only to get blown off.  If you can approach, you are way ahead of the game.  In addition, San Diego is not a huge, well-known city.  Most girls do not get approached during the day.  It is not a place like New York or London, where I can <a href="http://thisistrouble.com/2014/04/23/troubles-travels-volume-vi-yousowould-go-to-london/">recognize the area</a> simply because I’ve seen a zillion daygame videos filmed there.</p>
