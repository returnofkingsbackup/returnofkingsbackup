<p>One of my previous gigs (before I discovered the red pill) was in a multinational media firm predominated by women. In hindsight, I see that office as a soul-crushing nightmare for a red piller to work in because the boss was himself a mangina who was under the influence of his mistresses in the office.</p>
<p>She was a mature, progressive feminist spinster (previously a professional call-girl) from the FSU, whom he had given an insignificant job in the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/14599/human-resources-have-absolute-power-over-male-workers">HR</a> after having tasted her ‘goods’. I had subconsciously nicknamed her as <b>Madame du HR</b>, out of her self-confessed outspoken fascination for medieval French courtesans. She was an average looking, thin, long-legged pale woman with a conspicuous plump ass, but notable for her sexual allure and pull over men.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Office-wiles.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-34271" alt="Office wiles" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Office-wiles.jpg" width="461" height="346"></a></p>
<p>In spite of her ‘job’, a respectable family background and a higher education, she used to prostitute herself for money on weekends—to business clients, male coworkers, or any other rich influential man whom she met and caught a fancy to at work—and sleep her way to money and professional influence. The office had effectively become her brothel to ply her wiles on men.</p>
<p>After being on the same team with her, she expectedly made her move on me (like she did on everybody else), which I rejected out of both personal and professional ethics. But during the time I worked with her, I learnt some valuable lessons about workplace prostitution.</p>
<h4>1. Work place and part-time voluntary prostitutes are as common as professional prostitutes.</h4>
<p>Sleeping with the boss, business clients or coworkers for career gain or influence <em>is prostitution</em>—just as sleeping with a man to influence him to pay for domestic or personal expenses. These girls are no different from the working girls on the street whoring themselves for money. That’s what Madame du HR used to do—and often glamorized her own lifestyle to female interns. They were ‘trained’ by her and graduated as full-blown whores themselves to dominate men by the time they left their jobs.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Office-Intern.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-34274" alt="Office Intern" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Office-Intern.jpg" width="438" height="488"></a></p>
<h4>
<b></b>2. A woman’s sexuality often gives her more power and influence than her professional skill.</h4>
<p>Madame du HR spent most of her office hours chatting on the phone or idly surfing the web at her desk. In spite of being inefficient and incompetent, and the numerous times she was often reprimanded for her “non-professionalism” by the boss himself (sometimes in front of all the staff), she surprisingly retained her job. The reason? Because of her ass (her sexual exploits).</p>
<p>She often mockingly boasted how sexually ‘addicted’ the boss was to her ass, which afforded her the professional immunity.</p>
<h4>3. Voluntary prostitution is a self-rationalized delusion of utopia that women harbor to subconsciously destroy their own character.</h4>
<p>Madame du HR’s deadpan justification when I rejected her advances was, “You know what, I am a whore. But I know why I am doing it. It’s <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/909287/posts">just another job</a>, like any another profession.” She had firmly rationalized her choice to whore herself.</p>
<p>It’s common to see a lot of modern women having the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/prostitute-myth-has-strong-pull/176609.article">Pretty Woman</a> complex (a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM3CTpz2Ez4">role model</a> for some)—especially from <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/384/every-girl-has-a-price">the FSU</a>, to choose voluntary prostitution (a notorious <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/16728/russian-girls-are-all-whores">stereotype</a> with some truth), even though prostitution is a social evil. A lot of women keep sponsors for social benefits and end up marrying them, even while having boyfriends, without any qualms about it.</p>
<p>The ability to compartmentalize between love, sex and friendship is a trait unique to whores and sluts. With her dissociation of sex from emotion, a whore often destroys her own nurturing (emotional) ability to bond through sex – a trait unique to the emotional nature of women.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Whores can thus neither nurture nor bond to a man because their minds are self programmed to detach themselves from their emotional natures. Sexual loyalty is a joke for them while sex or love becomes merely an act or a profession, without emotion.</p>
<h4>4. Whores can’t deal with rejection and lack of attention even more as compared to ordinary women.</h4>
<p>After I rejected her, I faced intrigue and double-standards within the office (due to her sexual influence on the male management).</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Make-the-move.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-34273" alt="Make the move" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Make-the-move.jpg" width="464" height="261" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Make-the-move.jpg 644w, wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Make-the-move-620x350.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 464px) 100vw, 464px"></a></p>
<p>She made sure to make my office life miserable. Whores need attention because of their fragile egos, while real women need respect. And I had unknowingly implied to her that I rejected her because she was a whore (thus bruising her ego), even though I didn’t call her one.</p>
<p>Things became tense if she saw me even casually complimenting a female client or coworker—I was often given inexplicable disciplinary talks in the boss’s cabin about professional ‘etiquette’ (while she continued to whore herself to men with impunity right under his eyes ). I then realized <em>the depth of a mistress’s power</em> in an office.</p>
<h4>5. Never get involved with women who pursue you (especially at work).</h4>
<p>I’ve seen many men falling for this bait which usually entails a hidden trap—female control over men—not only in that office, but also in other real life situations.</p>
<p>Madame du HR embodied that– she aggressively pursued men whom she wanted to control (using sex). The men who fell for her sexual bait predictably ended up as her slaves.</p>
<h4>6. Never fuck with the boss’s mistress.</h4>
<p>A no-brainer which most of my male colleagues there failed to follow. The result was forced subservience to her, who dominated them by often threatening to reveal their shenanigans with her to the boss. She used fear as well as sex to control them.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Office-liasion.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34275" alt="Office liasion" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Office-liasion.jpg"></a></p>
<p>It’s often said never to mix business with pleasure, but what’s more idiotic is the stupid dog which shits in its own bed. The man who fucks the boss’s mistress becomes a toy boy pup of sorts, whose professional life then becomes a minefield with the detonation trigger in the hands of the eaten forbidden fruit (the mistress).</p>
<h4>7. Never work where whores rule<b>.</b>
</h4>
<p>A lot of businessmen offer their mistresses a job in their firms. The ensuing problem for the male staff is that they then have to actually report to two bosses: the actual male boss and his mistress. Looking at her behavior, I sometimes wondered whether the boss had deliberately hired her as a spy, to seduce the male staff on purpose so as to create both a professional fear (for fucking her) as well as to pry out their personal secrets (which he could then exploit to dominate them).</p>
<p>For the man refusing to sleep with such women, working in such places is where you often have to be reluctantly subservient to a glorified prostitute, not to mention the countless double standards and intrigues you’d have to endure for scorning a whore who wants to call the shots in the office. Yet you simply can’t afford to piss her off. Offices where whores rule are actually mangina producing factories.</p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
<p>Needless to say, after two years, I quit that soul-crushing job to regain my freedom again. A lot of my ex-colleagues still say to me that in retrospect how I could’ve possibly <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/28890/the-myth-of-female-agency">risen to higher ranks</a> within that office had I not rejected her. I reply that not all pussy is worth the <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/do-not-have-sex-with-feminists">risk</a>. Sometimes there’s a choice in life between a piece of ass, and <em>peace of mind. I</em>t’s better to choose the latter to maintain your freedom and <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-one-thing-i-will-never-give-a-woman">dignity</a>.</p>
