<p>If I may I would like to offer some life advice for young men and women…</p>
<h3>Men</h3>
<p>Whatever you do, do not get married. Do not even consider it. It is a terrible business decision and you will always regret it but by the time you do, you will be institutionalized to the point where you cannot function outside of the structure of having your wife tell you what to do and what to think and when to take a piss.</p>
<p>Then, because you are such a pushover and not man enough to do what you think is best, or because you are constantly saying wimpy things like “whatever you want honey” to avoid confrontation, she will be turned off (not knowing exactly why) and will start looking around her and mistaking the passing sexual attention of some nearby single “bad boy” and think it’s long term dating interest.</p>
<p>She will start thinking she is wasting her prime years with you. The loyal schlub that pays all her bills. She will start consulting her friends (who are probably already divorced and miserable) and they will seek to validate their own stupid decisions by telling her “you deserve to be happy” (when really they want her to be miserable, let’s face it, <em>women hate each other</em>).</p>
<p>Then one day just before she hits the wall (because you weren’t smart enough to marry a girl 10 years younger than you) she’s going to screw around with some guy and say “it just happened” (even though it never just happens) or she’s going to flat out leave you. Then you get divorce raped, then you are back out in the wild with your game skills so atrophied you don’t even know how to talk to a girl. You will spend years in misery recovering from this.</p>
<p>The only way to avoid this kind of shitty outcome with your wife is to be a man that makes HIS mission, (not his wife) his priority.  She will respect you then, and while she will constantly try and test your resolve with dramatic meltdowns and childish fits, every time you don’t give in, she will love you more (as opposed to her losing respect for you and loving you less).</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/travel3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-41470" alt="travel3" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/travel3.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em>As it ought to be</em></p>
<p>Women want to align themselves with a stronger masculine presence, it makes them feel feminine, special, and safe. They want a man with unshakable confidence, who believes in himself and who knows how to take charge of a situation.</p>
<p>The only way to become this kind of man is by living a full life, filled with adversity, defeat (and victory), setbacks overcome, and the type of life experience that evokes personal growth. You simply cannot achieve this by the time you are 25.  It just won’t happen, and marrying early will surely put a halt on completing yourself as a man.</p>
<p>Take your single bachelorhood, and travel as much as you can. See the world around you.  Meet beautiful women from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself about what you want out of life, do not bend to societies expectations of you.  Society does not care about the individual, only you will ultimately be on your side.</p>
<p>Stay fit, healthy and strong. Keep learning, study a second language, write about your life, study a martial art of some kind, learn to grill out like a champion (get a “kiss the cook” apron, trust me) and be like the shark that has to swim or die, only do it with self-improvement.</p>
<p>Do not become a fat bastard that puts Doritos on his sandwich. Be better than that.</p>
<p>Memorize this poem:</p>
<h4>If— by Rudyard Kipling</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>(‘Brother Square-Toes’—Rewards and Fairies)</p>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,</p>
<p>If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
But make allowance for their doubting too;</p>
<p>If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,</p>
<p>Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;</p>
<p>If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
And treat those two impostors just the same;</p>
<p>If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,</p>
<p>Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,</p>
<p>And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
And never breathe a word about your loss;</p>
<p>If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,</p>
<p>And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,</p>
<p>If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
If all men count with you, but none too much;</p>
<p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,</p>
<p>Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Men – if you are one of these wimps that has to have someone because you are needy and lonely (it’s going to fail because you are needy and lonely), or perhaps you have seen the world, completed yourself as a man, and are ready for a family, marry a younger girl.</p>
<p>Women don’t age well, and keeping attraction is vitally important. If she is your age and you are both in your 30s, she is going to look 40 while you still look good.</p>
<p>DON’T get married in the US, and preferably not to an American girl. Their manners are atrocious, they are narcissists addicted to getting “likes” on Facebook in order to give them a sense of self-worth.</p>
<h3>Now for the women…</h3>
<p>They need to learn to get their sense of self-worth by accomplishing things of merit.</p>
<p>Girls like to feel feminine and special, but because most are spoiled brats (who don’t even realize they had things handed to them their whole lives), they take the easy way out and throw on a slutty dress to get the quick fix of validation and post a “sexy” photo in order to get male attention.</p>

</div>
<p>It’s something I pity women for because it becomes a horrible cycle of need, where you only feel good when someone is giving you attention. It causes you to spend more time in front of the mirror instead of spending that time doing something noble, and of good character.</p>
<p>It ruins you, because you are addicted to a fleeting short-term fix of cheap self-worth, of which there will never be enough.</p>
<p>Women who sleep around don’t realize it, but they are screwing up their ability to be emotionally loyal.  They become addicted to the high of a new relationship, the chemicals and hormones that are released when they are intimate with a man (even with a one night stand), and so they are forever chasing that high as well, often confusing it with “being in love”.  The trouble of course happening when a relationship takes its natural course and that “newness” being over, they think they are no longer in love, and seek out another man.  The emotional and psychological costs of living this type of lifestyle is just not worth it.</p>
<p>Do not fall into the trap of trying to “enjoy your younger years” by dating around (also known as being a slut) just so you can later on decide when you are approaching 30 that you’re ready to settle down.</p>
<p>While I advise men, especially in the US, to stay single I’m advising you to lock down a good man as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Men need to be tempered like steel through all the trials I described above.</p>
<p>Women need to be sculpted and molded like a piece of art, and that can be done when they marry early to a man of substance who becomes a mentor of sorts.</p>
<p>Women need to be lead the same as when they do a ballroom dance.</p>
<p>Men of substance and means don’t want a 30 year old girl who’s about to hit the wall. The type of men you want value youthfulness and attractiveness and more than anything, they value a girl they can trust.</p>
<p>A girl who has spent most of her adult life partying and texting 15 different guys at once riding the cock carousel is not a girl who will ever be trustworthy. She is ruined, damaged goods, and not worth the trouble or risk.</p>
<p>She has lived a life of deceit and manipulation, and no amount of wanting to change will turn her into a suitable lifelong companion.  She simply cannot recover from that kind of social conditioning.</p>
<p>I know what you’re thinking, it’s “I don’t need a man to be happy! I have my career! I have my looks! I have my friends!” Ladies, I’m here to tell you, you have been fed a feminist lie. Just as men feel masculine when they fix things around the house for their wife or protect her from spiders, women feel feminine (and special) when they take care of their man and their family. The feminist lie that the only difference between men and women is their “parts” is an intellectual, bullshit, myth and if you don’t shape up soon, you will later find out the hard way.</p>
<p>Men and women are very different, and feminism is causing our poor women to create a disconnect between their feminine nature, and how they live their lives by being more masculine. They are taught to view all men as “potential rapists” instead of their protectors as they historically were (and still are). The result is a horrible one, as they go from failed relationship to failed relationship (driving good men away with crazy demands and a sense of entitlement), with the caliber of man declining each time as they get older and more worn down until their cat is their only companion.</p>
<p>Look at any older feminist and despite what she claims, she is a sad and lonely spinster, bitter at the world and unable to let go of the dogma she’s bought into because she has self identified with it so much, to reject it now would destroy her sense of self.</p>
<p>Men of stature DO NOT CARE if you have a college degree, those things are a dime a dozen, they want a woman who has her shit together.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20988_447080722045394_664221495_n.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-41471" alt="20988_447080722045394_664221495_n" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/20988_447080722045394_664221495_n.jpg" width="480" height="360"></a></p>
<p><em>She works in human resources…but who cares?</em></p>
<p>Don’t think because you have a degree that means you are special. EVERY girl has some bullshit degree (probably in HR or women’s studies) and men of stature DO NOT CARE about that.</p>
<p>A needy, high maintenance, whiny, girl who is hot, has about 72 hours until her attractiveness wears off. Don’t be some vapid and vacuous party girl that’s good for one thing.</p>
<p>Learn to make decisions about what to do, and what you think about something on your own and without consulting your friends.  Nothing is more unattractive than having to deal with a woman who is the type of person that follows the advice of the last person they spoke to.</p>
<p>Become a feminine, trustworthy, SOLID, and well-balanced human being.</p>
<p>And if you really want to stand out, learn to cook well.  Most women actually gain a lot of satisfaction from cooking the interest of their affection a nice meal.</p>
<p>Oh and for God’s sake, stay in shape and stay out of the tanning bed.</p>
<p>Don’t try and pretend to be this type of girl, BE this type of girl.</p>
<p>Find a man who is worthy of that type of woman and become devoted to him.</p>
<p>Women, look for a man who is willing to tell you “no.” Look for a man who will make decisions and not say “Whatever you want”. Look for a man who is driven towards his own mission.  Look for a man who tells you that you’re cute when you get angry.  Look for a man who other men want to be.  This is the type of man you will stay attracted to, and this is the type of man that will value a girl that makes a trustworthy companion.</p>
<p>Lock this man down, because this man is going to have his pick of women and if he is wise, he will choose the one that’s described above when he is ready for a family.</p>
