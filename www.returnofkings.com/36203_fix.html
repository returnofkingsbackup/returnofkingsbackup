<p><span style="color: #000000;">Recently, Facebook rolled out a new change. As many people know, a person’s relationship status was—unless proactively hidden—a matter of public record on Facebook. Many people took delight in sharing their relationship status with the world. This became, for all intents and purposes, the hallmark feature of Facebook—a chance for people, particularly females, to brag about their new beau online.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Now, if your want to know somebody’s relationship status, you might have to press an “ask” button. </span><span style="color: #000000;"> </span><span style="color: #000000;">A host of people, mostly women, are now choosing to keep this information private. I did a cursory check the other day, and noticed around ten women I know—all single/single mothers—that have made the crossover.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I sense a whole new market for game theory here—how to successfully pick up women by using their “ask” button!</span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FB1.png"><img style="width: 357px; height: 173px;" alt="FB#1" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FB1.png" width="175" height="93"></a></p>
<p>So why the sudden change then? Could something be amiss in relationship land?<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>In a recent CNN article, Facebook was noticeably evasive on the topic. MoMoZhou, a Facebook representative, stated that, “This feature provides as easy way for friends to ask for information that’s not already on your profile.” Hmm… ok. Another Facebook spokesperson stated that, “buttons have been available on mobile and Web for a few months for other profile information.” Ok, thank you for that.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>So again, back to my earlier question. Why the sudden change? Let me go ahead and toss my hat into the ring on this one.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></p>
<h3>
<b><span style="color: #000000;">1. Single older women are having a meltdown</span></b><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span>
</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Her relationship status was fun five years ago, when she was “single and ready to mingle.” Now, her continual inability to grab a guy is becoming bothersome. People, particularly other women, are starting to talk. If she is so attractive, why can’t she catch a man? What’s wrong with her?</span><strong><br>
</strong></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FB2.jpg"><img alt="FB#2" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FB2.jpg"></a></p>
<p>This fact becomes unbearable around Valentine’s Day. Single women are forced to watch the countless photos of flowers and chocolates that their married friends are receiving. It’s amusing to see married women take delight in torturing their single “friends.” They will inflict pain upon a single woman that no reader of ROK would ever dream of doing!</p>
<p>And of course, there is a blatant irony at work here—the fact that a single “modern” woman is hiding her relationship status. Wait a minute… I thought you were proud to be a “strong and independent ” woman? I heard for years how you don’t need a man. Shouldn’t you be proud of your single status? Shouldn’t you declare it loudly, instead of choosing to hide this fact? Well, as we all know, feminist hypocrisy knows no limit. It makes a profession out of saying one thing, but doing another.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Facebook has saved the day for these women. They will be allowed to continue their narcissistic romp across the information landscape. We will, for the time being, not be able to see that they’re perpetually single. They no longer will be perceived as a girl that cannot catch a man—now they are a mysterious possibility again. They have a “get out of jail” card for the moment.</p>

<h3><b>2. “Modern” women, particularly older ones, are finding it harder to attract a man. And that’s a good thing.</b></h3>
<p>Some people in the Manosphere claim that women, regardless of what they do, will never have to pay the piper; there will always be some thirsty beta to come and save the day. This may be the case in some places. However, this new move by Facebook seems to be suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p>Facebook felt the need to help women hide this information. It needed to protect their fragile emotional worlds from being damaged publicly. But what is the underlying cause of all this?</p>
<p>To better understand the issue, I think we need a statistical analysis. We can use the recent Pew report as a reference here. According to the nationwide report, the marriage rate in the US is at an all time low—down from 72% in 1960, to 51% today. Also, the divorce rate continues to be higher than it was in previous eras. Lastly, 40% of Americans now find marriage to be obsolete. Needless to say, the opinions of men are rarely polled in these studies. That being said, we can make this hypothesis based on the information; statistically, the institution of marriage is sinking like a Led Zeppelin.</p>
<p>What does this mean for the average single mother? Or, more particularly, a dysfunctional woman who destroyed her first marriage, thinking another sucker was just around the corner?</p>
<p>It means that there are fewer suckers than she thought. Given her hypergamous nature, a woman in her late 20s or early 30s will instinctively seek out an older man. Therein lies the problem. Many older men have already been burned. Some are in the midst of an ongoing nightmare with the ex: they cannot see their son, they are paying alimony, she left him for a ski instructor, etc. These men simply do not have the resources to make another mistake. They cannot afford to pick up the tab for a single mother with three daughters.<span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cena.jpg"><img alt="Cena" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Cena.jpg" width="480" height="480"></a></p>
<h3>
<b><span style="color: #000000;">Summary</span></b><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span>
</h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">This leads back to Facebook and the new changes to its relationship status page. There were a plethora of single women who, even after advertising they were single, were unable to land a guy. They miscalculated plan B. They thought a quality relief pitcher would arrive to take over for the previous starter. Men would continue to arrive in droves, much as they did in her early twenties. But sadly, these guys aren’t arriving. The fact has started to hit home—and it stings. Houston… we have a problem.</span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">By changing her relationship status to “ask,” she is essentially waving the white flag. She is saying that she lost a battle that she thought she could win.</span></p>
<p>Let’s hope that things continue to go into the tank for these women. It’s only when people have hit rock bottom that they are able to gain some humility. And if they gain nothing more than that, it will be a pleasant addition to their personalities.</p>
