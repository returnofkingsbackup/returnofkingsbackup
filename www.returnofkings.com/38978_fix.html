<p>A great many players will tell you that game did not come to them naturally. They had to work on it. They saw what they wanted, developed strategy and tactics and worked hard on it until success was achieved. In some cases it took years of painful and slow development to see any kind of success. But with tight game achieved, can it then be lost?</p>
<p>I am here to assure you that it can, indeed.</p>
<h4>Getting Game</h4>
<p>I got laid exactly twice in high school. In both instances, the girl made the first, second, and third moves, before I finally caught on to what she wanted. To say that I was shy around women is… well, understatement doesn’t even begin to cover it. I was deathly afraid of them. Lord knows, I wanted them, but had not a clue how to go about it. More importantly, I lacked the absolute most critical component of all players—confidence. Looking back, it is ridiculous to think of the missed opportunities that I had. What a dweeb!</p>
<p>And so, I joined the U.S. Marine Corps. Much of Marine Corps training is designed to build exactly what I was lacking. They even have an entire circuit entitled “Confidence Course.” Often mistaken for an obstacle course, it is designed to make you face your fears and physical limits, most notably a fear of heights. Some of these can be seen in the boot camp parts of the movie, Full Metal Jacket. I graduated boot camp at the tender age of 17, my confidence only starting to fill up. I didn’t realize at the time that it had a long way to go yet.</p>
<p>The next year and a half were the most hectic of my life. After boot camp came four more months of training (0311 or Rifleman was my chosen specialty), followed by posting to the ‘Fleet’. Deployment quickly followed, first to the Mediterranean as the Marine contingent of the 6th Fleet and then immediately to the Gulf for what turned out to be round one. These first two years in the Corps did not allow a lot of time for the ladies. The ladies I did encounter were either prostitutes or had multiple shields up that surpassed the simple slut type (more on that later). The reason I outline this is to show how and why my confidence kept increasing. I was achieving. I had graduated boot camp, completed infantry training, successfully integrated with my permanent unit (no small feat) and had been deployed twice, both times involving shots fired. I had already done things that most men will never do. After two short years, I was a “salt” and had the chest salad to prove it. I wasn’t just cocky—I was arrogant. All fear of women was gone.</p>
<p>In this time, while in Naples, Italy for only four days, I had my very first success with “game.” It should be noted that this was before the Internet, much less sites like ROK and others to give you tips and tricks. I am certain there were books at the time on how to approach women, but I wasn’t reading any. Anyway, Jenny was a waitress at a bar I happened in to and she was as gorgeous as her mixed Italian/Japanese ancestry would indicate. I honed in on her like a laser and banged her right there in the bar two days later. It was the first time in my life, that I had met a girl and successfully pursued her. Back on the ship that night, the guys gave me a hero’s welcome. Ego boosted.</p>

<p>Through my twenties, I improved and expanded my game, a term unknown to me at the time. I simply had that arrogant cockiness and observed what worked and what didn’t. I continually had at least two or three women in orbit around me, more or less waiting their turn. Some hotter than others, some more eager than others. I had a serious case of I-don’t-give-a-fuck that I wore on my sleeve and, in retrospect, I think that was the real clincher with most of these women. Fun though it was, it was not destined to last.</p>
<p>As I approached my thirties, I began to question my life and really began to want more out of it. So I got married. Almost as soon as I did, I lost all my game. What did I need game for? I was now off the market, right? I will now be married forever, right? Wrong.</p>
<h4>Disaster</h4>
<p>Losing my game happened just months into married life. It started with, you guessed it… finances. My wife had control of the checkbook and I tried arguing with her that I needed at least a share of that responsibility (talk about blue pill!). Basically, she just ignored me and I gave up after a while, since it was easier to not argue. I literally, handed her my paychecks, with her often forging my signature, since I had become that lazy. I should’ve just cut my balls off, since it was the same thing and with the same result. Needless to say, that was just the first domino in a long line of disrespect, culminating in the worst—infidelity. It was followed by divorce. In a heart-beat, I lost everything, my family, my house and my job. Wiped out. Bankrupt and alone. Everything that I had worked so very hard for, eviscerated.</p>
<p>What followed was years of depression. I went through life listlessly. I wasn’t even trying. Jobs came and went. I didn’t care. I even walked out on the best paying job I ever had. Life had no flavor and no purpose. Through my now ex wife, I was angry at all women and rarely even attempted any kind of relationship with them. The few women that I did approach could sense this depression and desperation and it acted exactly as the pussy repellant that it is.</p>
<h4>Learn from my mistakes, not your own</h4>
<p>I did recover. This article is proof of that. There was a time when I could not speak about these events at all and forget posting it on the interwebs for all the world to see. The recovery is for another time though, for now it is enough to finish with the moral of the story.</p>
<p>Never give up your game. Ever. For exactly zero reason. It is only years later that I realize that my marriage failure was entirely my own fault. I owned a nice home in the ‘burbs and had two new cars but I lost my children and everything else because I handed control over to my wife and she proceeded to do what women always do—destroy. Being married and building a family is all about stability and planning for the future; I can not think of anything that women are worse at than that. They act, react and “think” emotionally and this leads to precisely the opposite effect—instability and acting on whims. Nothing destroys more families than that.</p>
<p>So, if you are married or contemplating marriage, learn from my mistakes, not your own. Keep your game sharp and constant at all times. You will need it.</p>
