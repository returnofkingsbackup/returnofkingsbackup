<p>DC can be a tricky place to go out in. You can read plenty of statistics and see that there is about a three to one girl to guy ratio. It should be a single man’s paradise on paper, but what those study don’t tell you or doesn’t take into account is the DC female population’s average look, so bring that number down to 2 to 1 true girl to guy ratio. Now take into account the average weight of a typical DC girl now the ratio is about 1 to 1 of eligible guys and the real number of datable/bangable DC women. Now take into account the remaining attractive women will be constantly bombarded by the most powerful alphas with political connections and money then you can see in reality DC is one of the hardest cities for single guys to date in.</p>
<p>From going out in DC for over ten years and since I’ve started teaching my <a href="http://nexxtlevelup.com/game/wingman-night-game-workshop">wingman workshop</a> I have found that the great equalizer is knowing where to go out to meet the top one on one female to guy ratio and also encounter the least competition. How many pictures has Roosh put up of an average DC night spot showing three to five pink dots for females and twenty blue dots for males? At the same time I’ve been in some establishments where my friends and I were outnumbered by attractive females 3 to 1. This heavenly scenario happened for maybe two to three hours but I found if I return during the same night and time period I had a similar ratio.</p>
<p>The top five best places to go out in DC all depend on the night of the, maybe specific hours during that time period and what that establishment is known for. The scene can get a little bit more complicated depending on the type of girls you like and where they like to hang out at. Without further ado the top five best places in DC to go out with wingmen.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.barcelonawinebar.com/washingtondc.htm"><strong>1. Barcelona on U street (the get-the-night-started spot)</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Best time to go HH to about 10:30pm Tuesday through Saturday</li>
<li>Type of women mid-twenties to cougar all different nationalities, career women, preppy</li>
<li>Male competition is nonexistent mostly gay men during these time period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Barcelona is a swanky upscale Spanish wine and tapas restaurant on the lower part of U street right above Logan Circle. This is where the upper echelon of the DC working girls and socialites all meet to get wine and share different small plates of food. If you ever enter this location on a busy night then you’ll quickly notice that there’s approachable groups of girls and a large number of gay men. A lot of straight men in DC are busy pregaming at home or drinking at a sports bar and quickly over look this location because of the price, but if you designate Barcelona as your primary meet up spot to start the night then you’ll discover that you will be showered by plenty of female attention.</p>
<p>The girls meet around 5:30 or 6 in the bar area and will have been sipping white wine and gossiping for a few hours. Once you and your wingman show up they’re more than ready to be approached and talk with attractive straight men who have game. If you’re looking for an easy way to get the juices flowing and your confidence up with approaching women Barcelona is the location to start your night.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.lostsociety-dc.com/"><strong>2. Lost Society on U street (Best Thursday night rooftop international spot)</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Best time to go Thursday nights: 11pm to 2am  summertime rooftop</li>
<li>Type of women: International. You’ll fine Europeans, Eastern European, South American, Asian</li>
<li>Male competition: few single guys usually foreign guys that come with groups of their girls already. Easy to jump between groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are plenty of rooftops all over U Street and on any given night they’re all good. But on Thursday nights for some reason Lost Society located on 14<sup>th</sup> and U street is probably the best. It gets crowded but expect to find plenty of Russian women or turn around and talk to a German au pair. The international vibe of the place is open and friendly and not one that’s stuck up or hostile like some other international lounges in DC. Girls go there to talk to guys so if you and your wingman are trying to talk to foreign friendly girls maybe here for the summer this is the place to go out on a school night. The DJ’s they usually have play incredible house music as well.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.marivanna.ru/washington/"><strong>3. Mari Vanna on Dupont Circle (best Russian lounge… period)</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Best time to go: Wednesday night Karaoke, Friday and Saturday nights starting at 11pm</li>
<li>Type of women: Russians</li>
<li>Male Competition: Russian men who come with their girls or in groups but besides that not much non-Russian men to go against</li>
</ul>
<p>Mari Vanna is three level Russian restaurant that turns the top level into a lounge/ club after 10 pm. If you love fresh off the boat Russian women then this is the place you need to be at without a doubt. Not only Russian but Ukrainians, Romanians, Uzbekistan—all over the former Soviet Union. The place is easy to miss and usually the door is closed so from the outside it just looks like a busy restaurant but once you get to the top floor you’ll be transported to another dimension you didn’t know existed.</p>

</div>
<p>This is where you’ll find the best concentration of 8s to 10s in DC hands down. Of course if you don’t speak a little Russian then you’re starting from a very steep hill. Knowing just a little bet can get your foot in the door and is enough to win the bartenders over and remember you for service. The music is international and Russian disco. The Russian men aren’t a threat because they usually came with their women or don’t see you as a threat to take their women from them. Put it this way they’re there to drink and catch up not pick up more Russian women.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.townhalldc.com/"><strong>4. Town Hall Georgetown Glover Park via North of Georgetown (best spot for preppy girls)</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Best time to go: Saturday nights when it gets dark</li>
<li>Type of women: slightly older (but under 30) preppy girl</li>
<li>Male competition: tons but the thing is this place is still a 1 to 1 ratio of attractive girls to guys</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing about Town Hall is that it’s a fun place to hang out with your wingman. Plenty of attractive high class older preppy girls who’s mom and dad still help them out with their rent three years after graduating Georgetown. At first the small down side is that it’s an extremely preppy Georgetown type. You know what I’m talking about—J. Crew, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger madra shorts wearing crowd. Your natural instinct maybe to try and conform to this environment but if you know game then you’ll already know that the more you stand out the better your chances of getting noticed and attention.</p>
<p>Usually having more of a bad boy style, showing off tattoos, and being a little rough around the edges helps you to carry on conversations longer.  The girls are still in their sorority drunk stage so wait a few hours and you’ll be surprised how hard it is to get them to shut up. If you know how to carry a conversation and have a good wingman you’ll have a great opportunity to open up tons of preppy sets at this location. All you have to do is remember the typical preppy guys these girls are used to talking to and be the exact opposite.</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.richardsandoval.com/elcentrodf/"><strong>5. El Centro DF U street (best Latin club/lounge)</strong></a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Best time to go: Thursday (11:30) Friday and Saturday HH and all night</li>
<li>Type of women: Latin and all types of women who love Latin music</li>
<li>Male competition: men who know how to dance to Latin music.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve been in DC and have seen plenty of Latin and Salsa clubs come and go but by far hands down the best is El Centro on 14 and U street area. It’s one of the few Latin spots where actual Latin people actually enjoy going to. In the dark, grimy basement you will find tons of girls lined up by the bar and dance floor looking to be twirled around by men who know how to salsa or bachata or whatever is the new cool Latin dance craze. Here’s the thing… I hate El Centro because I can’t dance any of those dances. But I still go because I’ve been able to offset the lack of having Latin moves with a few power game moves.</p>
<p>For instance, I find a cute girl who’s friend or friends are busy dancing and she’s chilling on the side solo and then I chat her up. At this point if a girl isn’t getting any male interaction but her friends are having fun you’ll be surprised to how open they are for conversation. Another scenario is to admit you don’t know what you’re doing but to give it a try anyways. Luckily I do have enough rhythm to fake it and as long as you’re willing to give it a shot you don’t have to be the best dancer in the world.</p>
<p>Find a girl who doesn’t know how to dance to the Latin music and dance or with her regularly. Along with a nice dark basement there’s a rooftop patio that are filled with girls there for the fresh air and strong margaritas. On some nights this is a better alternative than going downstairs into a sweaty basement. On weekends between 10 and 12 the rooftop is alive with large groups of girls also there to meet men. If you start here with your wingman and get a girl or two to come with you to dance then the battle is halfway done.</p>
<p>There you have it. Going out in DC in a favorable environment comes down to strategy and timing. A favorable location can become unfavorable within hours of arriving as if the attractive women all migrate to another location knowing the next location is just as vital as well. Remember these top five best places in DC if you ever find yourself in a bar or lounge and you wonder where all the attractive girls in DC are. While running my<a href="http://nexxtlevelup.com/game/wingman-night-game-workshop"> wingman workshops</a> I’ve been able to find smaller less crowded bars that triangulate off of some of these locations where you can find smaller groups of girls not looking for a crowded scene to go out in.</p>
<p>Also as a side note I purposefully left off all the big name K street clubs in DC. Sure this would be the place to find the top 1% of attractive females in any race or nationality but by now everyone knows the amount of energy, finance, and level of bullshit you’d have to put up with is not worth even recommending for a proper night out with your wingman.</p>
