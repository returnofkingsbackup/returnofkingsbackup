<p>This is a novel about O, a woman who voluntarily becomes a sex slave at Chateau Roissy in France where she is whipped, tied up, and gangbanged in all her orifices by a menagerie of men. The story shows her deepening commitment to her masters and also the role she plays in trying to recruit additional women to the operation. It’s an old book so there was some tenderness and romance in many scenes, like when her vagina was stretched with a special dildo harness.</p>
<blockquote><p>She did not wish to die, but if torture was the price she had to pay to keep her lover’s love, then she only hoped he was pleased that she had endured it.</p></blockquote>
<p>She got into the lifestyle due to her submissive nature and her desire to prove her love to a man who wanted to enslave her for himself and his friends. The game he used was along the lines of, “If you love me, you’ll let this masked man violate your anus.”</p>
<p>Many passages gave me boners. They were fleeting and not fully engorged, but it did get my mind imagining how to be a dominant slave master. The convincing style of writing makes you think that all women want to be dominated like O.</p>

<blockquote><p>O was happy that Rene had her whipped and had prostituted her, because her impassioned submission would furnish her love with the proof that she belonged to him, but also because the pain and shame of the lash, and the outrage inflicted upon her by those who compelled her to pleasure when they took her, and at the same time delighted in their own without paying the slightest heed to hers, seemed to her the way redemption of her sins.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, my boners went away towards the second half of the book where I simply couldn’t get used to the beatings and pain even after it became clear that O loved it. Some women want to be tied up and anally pounded, but not all, and O’s enslavement became disturbing when the branding irons were brought out. It didn’t help that the writer gave O the personality of a dog. She was just an empty shell to be manipulated by her masters for awesome sexual pleasure.</p>
<blockquote><p>Would she ever dare to tell him that no pleasure, no joy, no figment of her imagination could ever compete with the happiness she felt at the way he used her with such utter freedom at the notion that he could do anything with her, that there was no limit, no restriction in the manner with which, on her body, he might search for pleasure.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you consider that this is a romance novel intended for women, it did a great job of holding my attention and keeping me sexually entertained, especially in the first half. It’s a quick read that gives you a disturbing look into the nature of some women (and men).</p>
