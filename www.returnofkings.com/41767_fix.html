<p align="left">Check out Julie Beck’s article, <a title="A (Straight, Male) History of Sex Dolls" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/08/a-straight-male-history-of-dolls/375623/" target="_blank">A (Straight, Male) History of Sex Dolls</a>. It’s an interesting survey of the history of sex dolls, followed up by a look into the phenomenon of RealDolls—a line of surprisingly sophisticated sex dolls with a dedicated and growing number of satisfied owners. Beck does a pretty good job of hiding her biases, but her clichéd feminism reveals itself when she inevitably casts the whole affair as yet another example of piggish men acting out their abusive attitudes toward women. She remarks that “plenty of men would like real women to be a little more like dolls,” and that these sex dolls “are reminders of unequal gender power dynamics that play out in the real world.” Sigh.</p>
<h3 align="left">Should you take this seriously?</h3>
<p align="left">When I first read Beck’s article, I thought these sex dolls must be for the sad, lonely, socially-inept loser with several thousand dollars to spend on taking his masturbation to the next level. But this analysis is a little too easy. While I was sure that some RealDoll owners fit the loser stereotype, I suspected that not all of them do. And they’re not as far from the norm as I thought. It turns out that 20% of people surveyed said that they’d be willing to <a title="bang a robot" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/05/07/poll-finds-1-in-5-people-would-have-sex-with-a-robot.html" target="_blank">bang a robot</a>. Would you?</p>

<p align="left"><em>If you build it, he will come.</em></p>
<p align="left">After any initial shock at the thought of human-robot coupling, take a few minutes to consider what’s really at stake, and why any man today would prefer a flesh and blood woman. Certainly there are a few decent women out there, but too many women today are selfish, emotionally fucked up money sponges with princess complexes who sometimes “forget” to take their birth-control pills. How about an alternative? I’ve never tried a plastic robo-pussy, and I can’t imagine that it would feel nearly as good as the real thing, but for a gradually increasing number of men, the trade-off is worth it to avoid all the hassles that come with real women.</p>

<p align="left">Already modern feminists have encouraged women to be just about anything except good wives and mothers, dramatically reducing their long-term utility to men. Increasingly, men are waking up to this, as evidenced by MGTOW, red pill culture, and the manosphere, and many men are either foregoing traditional marriage or seeking foreign women who still have their priorities straight. Soon, and maybe sooner than you might think, men will be assessing the short-term utility of women as well.</p>
<h3 align="left">Where do we go from here?</h3>
<p align="left">Well, that depends. Twenty years ago, a sex-bot would have been little more than a Hustler magazine hot-glued to a shop vac. Twenty years from now, a sex-bot might be a walking, talking, house-cleaning companion with more brains and personality than your average ho-bag barfly. And is it so hard to believe that such a thing could achieve mainstream popularity? Given that mainstream culture has already embraced having fake friends (Facebook) and <a title="fake children" href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/canine-corner/201105/do-we-treat-dogs-the-same-way-children-in-our-modern-families" target="_blank">fake children</a>, fake girlfriends and wives can’t be far behind.</p>
<p align="left">For years feminists have been able to indulge their most vicious, selfish, and immature impulses because they’ve still been able to use their pussies to get what they want. But the phenomenon of RealDolls serves as a sobering reminder of that old adage—be careful what you wish for. Feminists have also long advocated their independence from men, and pretty soon they might just get it. And after all, there is something egalitarian about it. Robots have put many hard working men out of a job, and soon they might take the jobs of all those women who pay their rent on their backs.</p>
<p align="left">The good news is, not all is lost. Already some women are waking up to the realization that the logical conclusion of modern feminism is isolation, a lack of fulfillment, and a state of stunted emotional development in which they offer men sex in exchange for room and board and putting up with their bullshit. In opposing what they view as objectification, feminists have ultimately objectified themselves, and in the not-too-distant future they may find themselves competing with objects. True to form, many women will try to cope by denigrating the competition, shaming men, or playing victim. Eventually, though, some will realize that they’ve failed to cultivate those qualities necessary for a mature and healthy long-term relationship. Before it’s too late, women wanting to avoid being rendered romantically obsolete will need to get their shit together. Fast.</p>
