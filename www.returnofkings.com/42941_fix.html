<p>For anyone who is familiar with great literature from the Manosphere, the following book and author needs no introduction. Nonetheless, I am going to try:</p>
<h3><strong>Who is Esther Vilar?</strong></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/51Noc3owv4L._SL500_SX300_.jpg"></p>
<p>Esther Vilar was born Esther Margareta Katzen on September 16, 1935 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She trained and practised as a medical doctor before establishing herself as an author. In 1960 Vilar went to West Germany on scholarship to continue her studies in psychology and sociology. She worked as a doctor in a Bavarian hospital for a year, and had held previous jobs as a translator, saleswoman, assembly line worker in a thermometer factory, shoe model, and secretary.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Unknown.jpeg"></p>
<p>In 1971 Vilar wrote the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Manipulated-Man-Esther-Vilar/dp/1905177178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411431829&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Manipulated+Man&amp;tag=rok0f-20">The Manipulated Man,</a> originally published in Germany under the title <em>Der Dressierte Mann</em>. The idea behind the book is that women are not oppressed by men, but rather men are controlled by women, an idea that has been bucking the politically correct ideologies of the West since the book’s first publication. There have been brutally honest writings about females dating back as far as biblical times, but Vilar’s book should be considered the earliest of sacred scrolls of 20th (and 21st) Century red pill wisdom. The author has managed to effectively anger all feminists worldwide, and she continues receiving death threats to this day.</p>
<p>The book asserts that women have a level of control of men that most men are not aware of, or most likely do not want to admit. The basic tactics outlined include:</p>
<p>• Duping men with sex<br>
• Administering meaningless praise to control men<br>
• Using emotional blackmail<br>
• Propagating the myths of love and romance as a guise to mask her real intentions and motives</p>
<p><img alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/twats2.jpg"></p>
<p>Her book is one bitter red pill to swallow, as it prompts a man to reconsider not only why the hell he should bother with marriage in the first place, but also his purpose in life and society. She also feels that man desires to be enslaved via getting hitched at the altar, which has more to do with influences from parental upbringing as well as the zeitgeist. To quote Vilar:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If a young man gets married, and starts a family and spends the rest of his life working at a soul-destroying job, he is held up as an example of virtue and responsibility. The other type of man, living only for himself, working only for himself, doing first one thing and then another simply because he enjoys it and because he has to keep only himself, sleeping where and when he wants, and facing woman when he meets her on equal terms and not as one of a million slaves, is rejected by society. The free, unshackled man has no place in its midst.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Thug-loving is not mentioned in the book, due to such tendencies in women likely occurring infrequently in 1970’s Germany. However, things have continued in the above vein: women will publicly praise a married man in front of her friends and family while secretly she’ll give herself to a violent asshole who gives her the kind of mental and physical abuse she desires. Today’s women are broken, yet they are spreading their legs and shitting out the bastard kids of losers who do nothing for society. Decent men have the same effect on women that daylight has on Dracula.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/twats7.jpg"></p>
<p>One common question that gets asked: If men are being manipulated by women via sex, then what about women’s sexuality? Vilar asserts:</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<blockquote><p>“A woman will certainly feel happy when she has an orgasm – but it is not the most intense pleasure she knows. A cocktail party, or buying a new pair of aubergine-colored patent-leather boots, rates far higher.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And therein lies the difference between men and women. It is no secret that in any arena that the guy with the gram of coke leaves with the hottest scag in the social gathering, while Mr. works-out-at-the-gym-and-knows-game observes this, scratches his head and wonders what is going on.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/twats4.jpg"></p>
<p>For quite some time just after the 1970’s American feminazi wave, many men assumed the behaviors we experienced in our women were limited to the borders of the USA. Today it is painfully obvious that is not the case, although Esther Vilar already knew that underneath it all, women were all the same:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The American woman is no worse than other women. She is only ahead of them all. Her unscrupulous tactics for exploitation would not be so dangerous if they were not constantly idealized by a powerful TV and film industry. As the latter creates the image of Western woman, her behavior is being copied, and as her standard of living is constantly raised, the fate of her husband automatically becomes the fate of men in other countries.”</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Enjoy her…fuck her….but don’t let her play you for a sucker:</em></p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/4XbbQr8cuUg%3Frel=0.html" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>No man will ever be loved or cared about as a human being by a woman, ever. It was once said that women are not good nor bad, they just are. And for philosophical perspectives perhaps that is true. One cannot blame a wolf for being a wolf, it’s simply nature; and it behooves us to be aware of the true nature of women. The flaw may very well lie in men as it would appear that we have been handed down a congenital defect in our brains, or perhaps this is all one big joke played on us by the cosmos or evolutionary biology; in that men desire something that does not care for us outside of tangible resources.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/09/twats9.jpg"></p>
<p>It is quite intriguing what she stated decades ago is very similar to this current state of affairs:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Only woman can break the vicious circle of man’s manipulation and exploitation – but she will not do it. There is absolutely no compelling reason why she should. It is useless to appeal to her feelings, for she is callous and knows no pity. And so the world will go on, sinking deeper and deeper into this morass of kitsch, barbarism, and inanity called femininity. And man, that wonderful dreamer, will never awaken from his dream.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we are at third wave feminism, and the situation has gotten to such extremes that a man will kill his own brother for a mere whiff of a woman’s vagina. There’s no telling where it will all lead, but one prediction comes from the author of the <a href="http://www.singularity2050.com/2010/01/the-misandry-bubble.html">Misandry Bubble</a>, who is forecasting some kind of awareness or paradigm shift by 2020. We’ll have to wait and see if that prediction comes to fruition.</p>
<p>For those of you who are already unplugged, The Manipulated Man may not tell you anything new. That said, I would still recommend getting a copy for the same reason any man who is religious would have a copy of his doctrine. At the very least you will find it interesting just how many of Esther Vilar’s assertions and predictions ring true today. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Manipulated-Man-Esther-Vilar/dp/1905177178/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1411431829&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Manipulated+Man&amp;tag=rok0f-20">Get your copy now from amazon by clicking here</a>.</p>
