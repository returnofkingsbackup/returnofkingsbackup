<p>Columbia University student Emma Sulkowicz has decided to publicly broadcast her “rape” experience by carrying around a mattress on campus at all times—purportedly the mattress she was raped on—as part of her senior thesis in visual arts. She claims to have been anally raped by a man with whom she twice beforehand had consensual sex.</p>
<p>Emma was so frustrated at the lack of serious response by the campus and police authorities that she is using the mattress to not only make a statement against rape but also to complete her requirements for graduation. She states that she will not stop carrying the mattress until her rapist is kicked out of school, yet reluctantly admits that she may have to carry it until she graduates.</p>
<p>Watch Emma describe what the mattress means to her:</p>

<p>The story of her rape <a href="http://indypendent.org/2014/06/12/%E2%80%98there-was-no-one-me-turn-to">sounds extremely suspicious</a>, and by extremely suspicious, I mean complete bullshit. The fact that she had to convince herself that she was raped several months after the fact and was hesitant to provide details to police should convince even a male feminist that her story is twisted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ES: My attacker was one of my closest friends at the time, and we’d had consensual sex twice in the past. There was a party and we left together. I invited him to my room because we’d had sex before, and we were having consensual vaginal intercourse. Soon though, he hit me across the face and started choking me and pinned my arms behind my head and pushed my legs up against my chest. He began to anally penetrate me. It was really painful and I was saying no, I was telling him to stop but he didn’t. Then finally he did, he got off and laid down next to me for a second. I was just frozen solid. I was petrified. And then he ran out.</p>
<p>I spent months in denial. I wasn’t really ready to believe that I’d been raped because realizing that you’ve been raped is realizing that people can take control of you and objectify you. In that moment, I wasn’t a human to him. I was just a thing. And that’s pretty fucking scary. Once I finally did admit to myself that it had happened, I was really unhappy. And I think a lot of what I’ve been dealing with since then is trying to find ways to believe that I am human.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She found it offensive that authorities didn’t just take her word for it and arrest the rapist immediately. How dare they ask her specific information about the incident in order <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/us/fight-against-sex-crimes-holds-colleges-to-account.html?_r=1">to determine if a crime had occurred</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Already anxious and queasy, Ms. Sulkowicz, a junior at Columbia University, said she felt her body freeze up and her heart race as she tried to answer questions that seemed to her to reveal not just skepticism about her story, but also disturbing ignorance in someone who had supposedly been trained for this role.</p>
<p><strong>“The fact that I had to tell an embarrassing story and then teach them an embarrassing subject on top of that felt really gross,” she recalled in an interview.</strong> Worse still, for her, was the outcome: The panel dismissed her accusation — the same result, she said, from sexual assault complaints against the same man that year by two other students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her rape accusation was so frivolous that not even the friend who she took to the police station with her for emotional support <a href="http://bwog.com/2014/05/16/emma-sulkowicz-files-police-report-for-sexual-assault/">believed her story</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Spec, Sulkowicz went to the police after finishing her finals on the 13th.  She filed a complaint with the NYPD after being dissatisfied with Columbia’s internal handling of the case.</p>
<p>Sulkowicz’s experience with the NYPD was harrowing, to say the least.  She describes the police as “dismissive,” as they emphasized the fact that she had engaged in earlier consensual sex with Nungesser and that she could not remember specific details of the attack, like what shoes Nungesser was wearing. They demanded graphic details, and one officer also allegedly told friends Sulkowicz brought for emotional support that he “didn’t believe [her] for a second.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once she discovered that police need actual facts, she decided that is was just too laborious for her. In <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/09/columbia-emma-sulkowicz-mattress-rape-performance-interview.html">a farcical interview with NY Mag</a>, she attempts to give her reasoning for not pursuing charges against the rapist who so destroyed her life:</p>

<p><b>The last time we spoke you said you had filed a report with the NYPD and they were starting to investigate. What is the status of that?</b></p>
<p>It got transferred to the district attorney’s office, and I decided I didn’t want to pursue it any further because they told it me it would take nine months to a year to actually go to court, which would be after I graduated and probably wanting to erase all of my memories of Columbia from my brain anyway, so I decided not to pursue it.</p>
<p><b>You were also hoping to file a complaint with the police regarding how you were treated. What happened with that?</b></p>
<p>I was contacted by an investigator who was really, really annoying to work with. He would call me randomly, and make me repeat everything that happened. He kept telling me I had to come into the station, and obviously I don’t want to deal with the police any more right now. It’s so disorganized, and it’s really upsetting to work with them at all.</p>

<p>Neither campus authorities nor police believed her. Combined with the fact that she is broadcasting her “rape” to the media, granting interviews to anyone who will ask (<a href="http://time.com/98433/video-ivy-league-rape/">here’s a video interview with Time</a>), and using it to get an easy A grade on her thesis, it’s safe to conclude that we are looking at a false rape accusation by a mentally unstable woman. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that this girl was not truly raped, and instead was sour about being pumped and dumped after giving up her anus to a guy she had the tingles for.</p>
<p>The icing on the cake is that she’s too lazy to even fulfill her victimhood project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One girl seems to be organizing some sort of website that will allow students to organize and figure out how to help me carry [the mattress] to all my classes.</p>
<p><b>Are you prepared to carry the mattress until graduation?</b></p>
<p>Yeah. I would prefer not to obviously — it is really painful and tiring — but I don’t think it is a protest. It’s an art piece.</p>

<p>Hearing about false rape accusations is <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/19980/say-hello-to-the-new-definition-of-rape">not uncommon in these parts</a>, but for many Americans it’s a new frontier in a culture which teaches them to always take a girl’s word for it. It’s becoming obvious to the everyman that rape accusations are being used as a weapon by women to gain attention, settle scores with men, and inject drama into their lives, giving them a perverse sort of life meaning that is not provided by an iPhone, psychology degree, and cock carousel.</p>
<p>While it would be easy for us to attack Emma for her unexcusable behavior, we should thank her instead. Emma is doing more than we can to show exactly how absurd “rape culture” has become and how meaningless a rape accusation is becoming. For the longest time, feminists have been complaining that crimes against them are not being taken seriously, but due to their own abuse of yelling rape, I believe that such as accusation will be brushed off much more easily than in the past. Girls are crying wolf a bit too much, and soon no one will believe them when they are ravaged by a real one.</p>
