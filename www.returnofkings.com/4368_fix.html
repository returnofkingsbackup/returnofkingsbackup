<p>There are words and moves that are so weak and that are so inherently beta that they bring a fatal blow to your game. These game-killers are as important to keep in mind as they are easy to avoid…</p>
<h4>
<span style="font-size: 1em;">1. </span>Giving or taking Facebook contact information<span style="font-size: 1em;">.</span>
</h4>
<p>If you met a girl, the last thing you want to do is downgrade you interaction to Facebook. If you are interested in her, there is no reason to either make her your Facebook “friend” or become one of her 500 Facebook friends. If she asks you “Are you on Facebook?” this is a perfect opportunity for you to mess with her lightly and ask “Why?” When you refuse to take your communication all the way down to Facebook, you will stand out so much in this day and age, when so many guys out there think that Facebook is the “safe” way to go. Perhaps they mistakenly use the term “safe” where “lame” would be more appropriate.</p>

<h4>2. Giving your number out to girls.</h4>
<p>Realize that the girl who takes your number is <strong><em>not</em></strong> going to call you. Very few women can hop over the well set social barrier and call the guy first, even when they are the one who get the guy’s number and even when they are interested in seeing that guy again. If you ask the girl for her number and she says: “Why don’t you give me your number instead?” you should say that you are a gentleman, and you believe that the gentleman should be the one calling the lady. If she still doesn’t give you her number, then you say “Never mind” and walk away.  She didn’t give you her number because she is either not interested, or too careful for her own good , or socially confused. Either way, there is nothing you can or should be doing about it.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<h4>3. Bragging.</h4>
<p>This is another classic beta behavior and a huge turn-off to women. The more you talk about how accomplished and great you are, the more likely you are to come across as an insecure puppy who needs to be patted on his back and who is lacking the most basic <a title="how to become more confident with women" href="http://www.practicalhappiness.com/how-to-become-more-confident-with-women/" target="_blank">confidence with women</a>. I seriously doubt that the likes of Bill Gates or Warren Buffet have the need to announce about how successful they are. You are not Bill Gates but you can certainly learn from him how not to try to impress others. You best way of impressing might just be simply <em>not trying to impress</em>.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bragging.bmp"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-4373" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/bragging.bmp" alt="guy bragging" width="220" height="146"></a></p>
<h4>4. Small talk.</h4>
<p>Small talk is meant to be an ice-breaker, not the “meat and potatoes” of your interactions with girls. Making comments about weather, her earrings and what’s on your plate at a dinner table is not going to make you sound interesting to be around, and it’s not going to make her want to see you again. Excessive political correctness might have been programmed for you since you remember yourself being able to talk, but it’s also an express, one-way ticket to <a title="how to stop being boring to girls" href="http://www.practicalhappiness.com/how-to-stop-being-boring-to-women/" target="_blank">boring the girl to death</a> or, at best, to friends zone, which I am sure you want to avoid.</p>

<p>By avoiding these four mistakes you already jump your game to the next level. Try it.</p>
