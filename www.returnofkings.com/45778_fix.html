<p>Yoga is an ancient philosophy that means literally “to unite with the Divine.” It was a way of life that helped one focus all of one’s actions on attaining this goal. Real men will tell you that to achieve anything in life you have to give 100 percent of your focus, a type of singular one-mindedness. Why should yoga be any different?</p>
<p>Yoga has gotten a bad rap in the west, and is considered something that women do. American women have taken such a great philosophy like yoga and they’ve turned it into a very shallow and superficial concept. What women call “yoga” nowadays is nothing but gymnastic bullshit. Real yoga requires a very high level of dedication. One has to be willing to change their entire lifestyle and outlook on life. Yoga is not just something you do for an hour a week, practicing pointless gymnastic exercises. But American women will corrupt whatever they can get their grubby little paws on.</p>

<p>To achieve anything requires very hard work and effort. The nature of women is that they want to be given everything for free and do not want to work for anything. However, for a man who is willing to put in the time, it can be highly rewarding. Yoga can offer men a much higher level of concentration, energy levels, and overall physical health, to name a few of the benefits.</p>
<p>This yogic breathing exercise is called Sodarshan Chakra Kriya. It is considered by many to be the most powerful yoga exercise ever. If you were to practice just one yoga exercise, this is the one.</p>
<p>Instructions for performing Sodarshan Chakra Kriya:</p>
<p>1. Sit up straight, preferably in the siddhasana posture (picture below). Try to keep your spine as straight as possible.<br>
2. Rest your left hand on your left knee. Block your right nostril with your right thumb and have the remaining fingers pointing upwards.<br>
3. Now breathe in deeply through the left nostril filling your lungs to capacity. Lower your right hand now and place it on your right knee.<br>
4. With your breath held in begin to pump your stomach (pulling in the abdominal muscles) and mentally count with each pump, 1, 2, 3, and so on.<br>
5. Once you have reached 48 stomach pumps with the breath held in, raise your right hand, close off the left nostril with your right pinkie and breathe out of your right nostril.</p>
<p>This completes 1 cycle – breathe in through left nostril, hold and pump, breathe out through right nostril. Continue to repeat this cycle for the duration of the practice. This can be practiced for up to 3 hours daily.</p>

<p>Siddhasana sitting posture</p>
<p>In the beginning, it will be very hard to hold in your breath long enough to do 48 pumps, so it is best to start small and work your way up.</p>
<p>Beginner’s Level: 16 stomach pumps instead of 48<br>
Intermediate Level: 32 stomach pumps instead of 48<br>
Full level: 48 stomach pumps, as described above</p>
<p>A video demonstration of it:<br>
</p>
<p>The only modification I have made to it is that instead of mentally repeating that “wahay guru” mantra with each stomach pump, I mentally count 1, 2, 3, and so on, for each stomach pump. I don’t know how I’d be able to keep track of the number of stomach pumps unless I mentally kept track of the number. This yogic breathing exercise is very simple to practice and you don’t need to go to some feminized yoga class to learn it or listen to some mangina yoga teacher.</p>
<p>It is best to practice this on an empty stomach, before eating or 2 to 3 hours after the last time you ate. This yogic breathing exercise will also help purify your eating and drinking habits. It’s very difficult to practice it if you eat a lot of processed food, because the processed food will slow down your digestion and clog up your stomach. This is especially true for products that are made with white flour. As for drinking, it’s impossible to practice if you’ve been drinking hard liquor the night before because your stomach will feel like complete shit.</p>
<p>This yogic breathing exercise falls more into the category of pranayama or kundalini yoga rather than hatha yoga, which is the showboat gymnastics yoga that most women practice in the West. It will not only help improve your physical health but also your emotional and mental health as well.</p>
