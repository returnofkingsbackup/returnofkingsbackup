<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/16/women-and-prescription-drug-use_n_1098023.html">25 percent </a>of American women are taking psychiatric drugs, with the majority of those being anti-depressants. As anti-depressant drug use has increased 350 percent over the past 10 years, it raises the question: Is anti-depressant drug use causing the massive increase of fat women in America?</p>
<p>As a personal anecdote, every single American woman that I’ve known that has used anti-depressant drugs has been at least moderately obsese (10 pounds or more over the healthy body weight limit), and many of them have been outright chunky landwhales, the mere sight of which would make you want to vomit.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Extremely-Fat-Woman.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-46077" alt="Extremely Fat Woman" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Extremely-Fat-Woman.jpg" width="415" height="530"></a></p>
<p>Why do so many American women feel the need to turn to drug use in order to cope with reality? Is life really that hard for women in America? In rural India, some women have to walk many kilometers each day carrying large pots of water on their heads. Or in Pakistan, car bombings and other acts of violence are an almost daily occurance. And yet women in India and Pakistan aren’t guzzling down anti-depressant drugs in record numbers.</p>
<p>The fact is that American women are the most spoiled, pampered women on the planet and have an extremely easy life. Why then are they so unhappy? Any man that has travelled outside of America and met foreign women will tell you that women outside of America are much more mentally stable and much more likely to have a healthy body weight. Outside of America, the vast majority of women don’t take anti-depressant drugs and aren’t fat either. Coincidence?</p>

Give me a spicy Pakistani woman any day of the week over a fat chunky American landwhale</p>
<h4><strong>Do anti-depressant drugs cause weight gain?</strong></h4>
<p>According to Norman Sussman M.D., a psychiatrist and associate dean for postgraduate medical programs at the NYU School of Medicine, the <a href="http://www.webmd.com/depression/features/antidepressants-weight-gain">side effects of weight gain</a> appear with long term use of anti-depressants, generally appearing after 6 months of first starting the usage of the drugs, although some anti-depressant drugs can cause weight gain both in the short term and long term.</p>
<p>Antidepressants have been associated with <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-antidepressant-diet/201007/reversing-antidepressant-weight-gain">weight gain</a> since they were first used about 50 years ago, according to Psychology Today. One woman even reported that she went from petite to obese, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/judith-j-wurtman-phd/antidepressants-weight-gain_b_5495403.html">gaining 100 pounds</a> in weight after having started the usage of anti-depressant drugs.</p>

<p>About 70% of people in the United States are overweight and, in a cruel catch-22, many of the drugs used to treat obesity-linked conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and depression can themselves cause <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20545602,00.html">weight gain</a>, according to Health.com.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/the-depression-and-weight-gain-conundrum/373175/">One woman</a> who had been taking Zoloft for two years described her own situation on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote><p>[All of the SSRIs I’ve taken] have caused weight gain, and lately it feels totally unmanageable. I work out 5 days a week, cardio and lifting free weights, and still the pounds keep coming. I watch what I eat. I don’t drink or do recreational drugs anymore, I even gave up smoking. I’m in therapy. Basically, I am doing all the shit necessarily for an emotionally healthy and stable life and it really frustrates me that I am still piling on the pounds. I was a fat kid and body issues are a big deal for me. Weight gain tends to spark feelings of panic and self-loathing and hopelessness, all of which can help me slip right into depression again.</p></blockquote>
<p>One study even discovered that mothers that took <a href="http://endoftheamericandream.com/archives/30-million-americans-on-antidepressants-and-21-other-facts-about-americas-endless-pharmaceutical-nightmare">antidepressants</a> during pregnancy were four times more likely to have a baby that developed an autistic spectrum disorder. American women are not only damaging their own bodies with anti-depressant drug use, but also the bodies of their unborn children. Congratulations, ladies.</p>
<p>There is also the troubling possibility that, in some cases, the causal arrow points in the opposite direction—obesity may exacerbate an existing tendency toward depression, creating a vicious cycle that is depriving the American man of dateable women. Americans eating a standard diet are constantly being <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8555/monsanto-ruins-american-bodies">force-fed poison</a> that makes it much more difficult to maintain a slim physique, and research is finding that what goes on in the brain is <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fendo.2014.00117/full">inextricably linked</a> to what we put into our stomachs.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fat-Woman-11.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-46080" alt="Fat Woman 1" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fat-Woman-11.jpeg" width="393" height="386" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fat-Woman-11.jpeg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Fat-Woman-11-50x50.jpeg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 393px) 100vw, 393px"></a></p>
<p>In either case, a clear aspect of the problem is that American women have had such easy lives, never having experienced any real hardship or difficulty. As it stands right now, most American women are nothing but a bunch of spoiled little brat children who never grew up and learned how to function as adults, as women, instead of acting like an immature 12 year old girl. And most of them certainly never learned to cook nutritious meals for themselves, instead relying upon eating processed slop that may actually lead to mental illness.</p>
<p>But as more and more men reject feminism and <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/us-usa-marriage-survey-idUSKCN0HI06C20140923">boycott marriage</a>, American women will have no choice but to adjust their behaviors, change their bad attitudes, and lose some weight. Otherwise they will end up growing old alone with their 10 cats.</p>
