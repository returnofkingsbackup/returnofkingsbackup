<p>At first I was confused why GamerGate was such a big deal. So feminists reportedly<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/42109/how-zoe-quinn-screwed-her-way-through-the-video-game-industry"> screwed their way through the video game industry</a> and pretended to be victims of male aggression. Aren’t they always doing that? Aren’t there thousands of Zoe Quinns out there?</p>
<p>But then the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/42399/why-is-the-zoe-quinn-scandal-blacked-out-across-the-internet">censorship started</a>, pervasively on forums such as 4chan and reddit. Then came a massive assault by the news media and video game industry. If this issue isn’t such a big deal, why do they so fiercely abuse their own consumers? Deep in my stomach I could tell something was very wrong.</p>
<h3>The Internet Will Destroy The Press</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-46422" alt="1" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/1.jpg" width="480" height="353"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Victor Hugo (1802-1885) once said, “The printing press will kill the church.” In medieval times, the universal church held on to power through the production of books. They ran the religion, government, commerce, every aspect of social life. People literally were executed for owning or copying important records such as the bible because it could threaten the church’s control.</span></p>
<p>But suddenly the printing press afforded the common man the opportunity to write his own books and spread his own message. After that, despite years of wars waged by authorities, the printing press prevailed.</p>
<p>The cathedral was overthrown and a new building rose in its place, one <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q0nE1cCtCsKvgdtQ8NPOuN2A5UOfAahWV3W8U36z3BU/edit">built by the common man</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The press, that giant machine, which incessantly pumps all the intellectual sap of society, belches forth without pause fresh materials for its work. The whole human race is on the scaffoldings. Each mind is a mason. The humblest fills his hole, or places his stone. Retif dè le Bretonne brings his hod of plaster. Every day a new course rises. Independently of the original and individual contribution of each writer, there are collective contingents. The eighteenth century gives the Encyclopedia, the revolution gives the Moniteur. Assuredly, it is a construction which increases and piles up in endless spirals; there also are confusion of tongues, incessant activity, indefatigable labor, eager competition of all humanity, refuge promised to intelligence, a new Flood against an overflow of barbarians. It is the second tower of Babel of the human race.” <em>(Hunchback of Notre Dame, Victor Hugo, 1831)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The internet is the next great invention. Today, anyone can create a website and spread beliefs. Everyone is connected and everyone contributes to some degree. We don’t need CNN to give us the headlines or to tell us what to think. But this freedom does not come without great conflict. Today, just as then, the authorities are not willing to give up their control.</p>
<h3>Gaming: The Third Tower of Babel</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-46425" alt="4" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4.jpg" width="480" height="295"></a></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">

<p>Hugo called the printing press the “second Tower of Babel.” Without getting religious, let’s look at the reasons why the Tower of Babel fell. Civilization was going through a technological revolution at that time. The invention of baked bricks allowed the people to construct buildings like never before and to express their opinions and beliefs in architecture. It was a communication revolution. But then their language got confused. Their society fractured because nobody could understand anyone else. Each individual wanted things his way and that broke up society.</p>
<p>But “if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.” And this is where gaming comes into play. So-called social justice warriors still cling on to the structure of the old days because they are frightened of a future without it. Their great crusades of social justice are nothing more than preservation of an antiquated belief system.</p>
<p>And it is true, the new system leaves destruction in its wake. Just look at the state of the music industry. Popular music gets progressively worse, and do you think peer-to-peer technology has nothing to do with it? Look at Hollywood in the age of YouTube, tumbling to the ground in a disgusting heap. Remediasation has very real and huge implications: we in the West are losing our language.</p>
<p>Gaming is a large part of that revolution, an industry for which revenue <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/25/5840882/games-industry-revenue-hit-100-billion-by-2018-dfc-Intelligence">will soon hit $100 billion</a>. In the UK, gaming already accounts for <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/www.ibtimes.co.uk/video-game-biggest-entertainment-category-uk-317940">40% of the entertainment industry</a>. This is because gamers more than sit on a couch and consume a story. You become part of the story and influence what is going on. You interact with other gamers and build communities. How much power will they hold onto if any man can build and distribute their own story in this kind of medium?</p>
<p>This is why SJWs are so eager to attack gamers. This is why big-shots like Joss Whedon are so eager to compare us to the KKK, and why SJWs cry foul like a losing soccer player. The gaming medium will fundamentally change how we live, and they want the same authorities to remain in control, because that is what they are comfortable with.</p>
<p>We are learning little by little that the people who control the media, the celebrities, the gaming industry CEOs, the journalists, are just the same as the Church inquisitors of the dark ages. This is starting to really sink in. They call themselves “liberals” but they are just the opposite.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-46424" alt="2" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/10/2.jpg" width="448" height="299"></a></p>
<h3>Return Of Kings At The Lead</h3>
<p>The old authorities can hold on to power if they edge out new developers and control the discussion. But alternative discussion platforms don’t allow them to do that. All it takes is a few people to boldly say the old rules of political correctness are ridiculous. A backwards hierarchy where women dominate men and deviancy of all kind is rewarded will not stand. These ideas catch fire because they ring true.</p>
<p>The social justice warriors lust for control because they know there is no future for them. This revolution is what Roosh champions with Return of Kings. The individual is liberated and change an old-fashioned, perverse, unnatural social structure. We are less consumers and more independent creators.</p>
