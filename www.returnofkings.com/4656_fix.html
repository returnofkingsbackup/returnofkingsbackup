<p>I decided to read Hanna Rosin’s <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/17i8uf/i_am_hanna_rosin_author_of_the_end_of_men_ama/?sort=top">recent AMA</a> since she’s our <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/2099/the-9-ugliest-american-feminists">#5 feminist</a>, plus I knew nothing about her nor ever considered her to be anything special.  My suppositions were correct.  She was asked hundreds of questions yet only responded to a few in detail, mainly the softballs.</p>
<p>Look at how bad she fumbles when attempting to answer even moderately challenging questions…</p>
<h4>1. Society thinks men are weird and more men need to become MRA’s</h4>
<p>When asked, “What should be done to help men,” this is the answer Rosin gave:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I think the general gist is, why, if women are doing so well, aren’t we reaching out and helping men? I think the answer is that we as a society think that’s weird. We have a hard time thinking of men as people who need help.</strong> So, for example, in my education chapter, I write about the open secret among admissions officers at private colleges that men get affirmative action, but also about how we are so squeamish about acknowledging that. <strong>So there are a ton of things we could do to help men but maybe men have to band together and advocate for some of those things, and not solely in the context of divorce and the law.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it guys.  Until men rise up to the giant shit test that is feminism, society is just going to keep thinking you’re weird if you want help.  Better do something about that… you better become an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_rights_movement">men’s rights activist today</a>.</p>
<h4>2. The hookup culture is good for women, except that it’s not</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s really easy to tune into the heartbreak of a 35 year old woman or man for whom a good relationship has been elusive. <strong>I think no matter what we say we all want to love and be loved. But if you think of the hook up culture as something that happens in college, the fact is, most college graduates end up married, and in stable and relatively happy marriages.</strong> So I don’t think there is much evidence that hook up culture leads to loneliness. One other thing: I don’t “endorse” it. I just get tired of hearing how it destroys women. Joan Didion once complained about certain strains of the feminist movement perpetuating a vision of women as “creatures too ‘tender’ for the abrasiveness of daily life, too fragile for the streets… too ‘sensitive’ for the difficulties and ambiguities of adult life.</p>
<p>So, yes, there is heartbreak but there is also a lot women gain from their independence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So even if college girls piss away their best years as nothing more than sex objects, it’s cool because they’ll still be able to settle down with the man of their dreams so they can try to conceive before menopause.  Like this woman:</p>

<p>Lucky couple.  However, someone had the nerve to ask Hanna an interesting question about having lots of sex:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think about the rising rates of single motherhood and fraction of babies born to unwed mothers? <strong>Considering that non-married families are far less symmetrical in child care than married ones, isn’t this a step backward for women?</strong> How do you see this trend affecting the balance between the genders?</p></blockquote>
<p>Rosin responds,</p>
<blockquote><p>I write about this in my book. I don’t think it’s great. The term studies use is “ambiguous independence” – meaning there is a certain degree of empowerment in going it alone, providing for your family, etc, but it’s far from ideal.</p></blockquote>
<p>So is a promiscuous culture good or bad?  Apparently Rosin cannot draw the connection between out of wedlock sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy.</p>
<p>While masses of college co-eds are slutting it up and <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/may/9/education-level-inversely-related-to-childbearing/">producing no children</a>, the women who contribute absolutely nothing to society breed without remorse. But I guess this is okay for Ms. Rosin. As long as someone marries these aging spinsters or takes care of their bastard children, promiscuity is not bad for young women.  Might suck for nearly everyone else (not for me) but at least women can have 10 years of fun.</p>
<h4>3. The End of Men was written to help women understand men.</h4>
<p>I don’t even know what prompted the Rosinator to write this response, but it is face-palm worthy:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m afraid to say anything about the men’s rights movement lest I inspire more rage but I will say that one of my aims in writing the book <strong>was to better understand the men who seemed out of work or resentful of their money making girlfriends or just plain lost</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>By writing an entire book about how men are the losers of today’s society, Rosin is helping women understand men.  So if I wrote a book called <em>The End of Gays </em>detailing all of the shortcomings of their culture, I could avoid homophobic criticism by telling everyone “It was done to better understand fa – I mean, gays.”</p>
<p>I get it!</p>
<p>I can imagine what an American woman thought about men before reading <em>The End of Men</em>:</p>
<p>“Men! So frustrating! Why are they all so messed up? Why can’t they make me happy?”</p>
<p>And now the same woman after reading <em>The End of Men</em>:</p>
<p>“Men! They’re just a bunch of jealous losers because their patriarchy is collapsing under the weight of the glorious feminist revolution. Losers.”</p>
<p>Thanks for helping women understand, Hanna.</p>
