<p>Roosh made a recent post about <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/3069/american-women-simply-cant-compete">American Women who cant compete</a> with foreign women and referenced a mail order bride event. As I was reading through the response to the article I noticed what has become a rather typical pattern in the comments. For some reason, the minute anyone mentions the words “foreign brides” or “mail order brides”, there is a mini descent into madness where all common sense and reason gets thrown out of the window.</p>
<p>The responses vary, but the common theme is that these women are nothing more than gold digging, green card chasing whores who will divorce these men the first chance they get. According to the majority of respondents, these women are laying traps to land suckers, betas, and whales. The belief that they may actually be the marriage minded, feminine women, that these countries tend to produce in droves, rarely enters the equation, they are just labelled mercenaries who will be out the door the minute they get the chance. What then almost always follows are anecdotal accounts of people who know scores of Russian, Eastern European or foreign women who are foreign brides that divorced local men after they brought them in. I would love to know where these guys meet all these divorced bitches with their new green cards, but the minute you raise this topic everyone knows like 300 of them it seems.</p>
<p>So I thought what the hell, let me see if I can drum up some stats and get to the bottom of it. I have seen statistics before that show its the exact opposite of what everyone normally says, yet the spazfest that people always throw when this subject comes up made me wonder just how true it all was.</p>
<p>Now I believe the vast majority of women looking for husbands are genuine given what I know of the cultures and the places I have traveled to over the years. I think because these women are more traditional and conservative, a decent guy will probably stand far less chance of divorce too. I also know that these women tend to be far more logical than the degenerate whores Western men deal with on a daily basis too, so the women would be less prone to divorcing unless the guy was abusive, a really poor provider or an absolute loser. They are prone to hypergamy just like all women, but its no where near as severe as it is with the average western slut.</p>
<p>I also believe that the foreign passport hunting, gold digging whore is one of the biggest myths out there. Sure, there are going to be horror stories and these women do exist, I just doubt that the horror stories are more frequent than the average divorce hell 50% of most Western men will go through. And I think that the majority of guys who end up going through hell with a foreign woman tend to meet these women <em>in their home countries</em>, instead of meeting those marriage minded foreign women in the <em>woman’s home country</em>.</p>
<p>Lastly, I always believed western women in general are threatened by this development, resorting to mindless accusations of exploitation in an effort to shame this behavior before it gains any mainstream traction.</p>
<p>The first study I wanted to share was one that used to be on Wikipedia. <em>Used to be</em>. Someone has decided to remove it, and I think it was removed because for some reason, the original <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.5af9bb95919f35e66f614176543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=6a60f38aa4f97310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=0d656782d3c37310VgnVCM100000082ca60aRCRD">USCIS study was removed.</a> I know it was there because I have shared it in the past, and any search on the web for the extract below turns up countless websites that cite the study as a legitimate government source. I say this as I place the tinfoil hat on my head, but clearly its the sort of information that does not suit current policy makers and legislators that are pushing for restrictions on foreign brides.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) reports that “…marriages arranged through [mail order bride] services would appear to have a lower divorce rate than the nation as a whole, fully 80 percent of these marriages having lasted over the years for which reports are available.” The USCIS also reports that “… mail-order bride and e-mail correspondence services result in 4,000 to 6,000 marriages between U.S. men and foreign brides each year.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>80% of the marriages have been successful.</strong></p>
<p>This is not some guy bringing back his foreign wife after meeting her there on a trip or holiday. Its not guys who were expats somewhere and returned home with a wife after living there. These are outright MAIL ORDER BRIDES. These are guys going onto the internet or using services to find women to marry from day one. Zero romance and courtship, straight to business, I’ll-get-to-know-you-once-we-are-married type marriages.</p>
<p><strong>Eighty percent</strong>, and these are mail order brides, these are not women they met and gradually built a relationship with before they took the plunge. They are going into this with the intention of marrying them from the first meeting most of the time.</p>
<p>Next up is the <a href="http://www.cis.org/MailOrderBrides">Centre for Immigration Studies</a> who again state a 20% divorce rate with mail order bride marriages. A separate organisation comes to the same conclusions the Immigration Department did, focusing on statistics gathered from foreign countries and agencies as they try to build a picture. Again, we see the same statistic: 80% of the marriages have been successful. Now granted these are statistics based on the USA in particular, and I was curious to see what the situation was in other Western countries with high divorce rates.</p>
<p>The next study was conducted in Switzerland. The white paper is available but its long, so I just share the web extract. Again, we see the same outcome, where divorce rates are far lower when the foreign women are not “Western”. <em>Ironically, they also track the divorce rate between</em> <em>Swiss women and foreign men, which clocks in at 80% failure rates</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The statistical office of Switzerland has published some more detailed statistics: Note that to draw any conclusions, the divorce rate of mail-order marriages must be compared to the divorce rate of domestic marriages. In 1999, the divorce rate for domestic marriages (Swiss married to Swiss) in Switzerland were at a record high of 50%. In the same year (1999), marriages with foreigners are comparatively better: Marriages between Swiss and German or Italian women have a comparatively better divorce rate: 40%. Marriages between Brazilian or Thai women and Swiss turned out to be more durable than expected, the divorce rate reached the low rate of 30%. Fantastically low divorce rates were reached at marriages with women from Colombia (20%). Marriages with women from the former USSR reached a rate of 15%; however, it must be noted that marriages between Swiss and Russians boom at the moment, and that the divorce rate is not that much meaningful, because the divorce rate rises with a time-lag. However, there are also marriages between Swiss and foreigners where the divorce rate is worse than the domestic rate: Marriages between Swiss and women from the Dominican Republic tend to work very badly, the divorce rate reached catastrophic sixty percent. Similarly, but not quite as bad, the divorce rate in marriages between Swiss and Philippine women reached 45%</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>So 85% success rate with women from the former USSR for the Swiss</strong>. The Swiss divorce rate is approaching 50%, yet these marriages are clocking in at 85% success rates.</p>
<p>Where is the passport hunting, divorcing mercenary everyone is talking about? Here we have arguably the two most desirable passports in the world on offer, and the success rate for these marriages is clocking in at rates that rival the divorce rates of the 50’s. Which shows that not only is there a complete misconception about the nature of these marriages, but there is a misconception about foreign women who marry western men under these sorts of arrangement. Many are simply conservative, traditional, marriage minded women looking for a husband and a better life.</p>

<p>This is supported by yet another major study called <a href="http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/main/newsitems/student-wins-award-mail-order-brides">Negotiated Nuptials: A Transnational Analysis of the International Marriage Broker Industry and the Russian ‘Mail-Order Bride’</a>. It goes into great detail proving how mail order brides don’t suffer abuse like the feminists are saying they do. At the same time, the research concludes that the vast majority of women looking for foreign husbands are genuine in their search. This study even won some feminist award, which shows the levels of hypocrisy. So not only does it prove that the feminists are exaggerating the rates of abuse, it also goes on to show how many of these arrangements are not only genuine but successful too.</p>
<p>Which point towards an agenda driving this misconception, and its an agenda that has even forced through legislation in the USA called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Marriage_Broker_Regulation_Act">IMBRA</a>. Using nothing more than a few horror stories of abuse (which in itself could be lower than the average too for all we know), legislators have been lobbied into submission and inevitably complicate the entire process in an effort to slow things down. Men are put through substantial background checks and treated like absolute criminals simply because they have decided to seek foreign wives through non-traditional methods. Despite the fact that all parties involved are consenting adults, this legislation has been pushed through without any major study or even widely available statistics to justify the law. What statistics we do have shows the complete opposite of the perception many have.</p>
<p>Another thing that that turned up through my search were some ridiculous representations by feminists and the media too. The more I dug into it the more blatant it seemed. Clearly this is seen as a major threat to the harpies, because the lengths they are going to are absurd. The funniest example that I came across was a story about an English guy who started a marriage agency. He said in his interview that men are looking for feminine, traditional wives who are unspoiled by feminism, and he introduces them to each other.</p>
<p>This is the response from the female journalist about the whole thing, who equates it to human trafficking and slavery because these women tend to be housewives:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, couples can get around this obstacle by claiming they met through other avenues. There also tends to be little enforcement of IMBRA when the agencies are based outside the U.S. (Hand-In-Hand, for example, is registered in St. Kitts.) “The mail-order bride industry is a softer version of human trafficking,” says Sonia Ossorio, executive director of the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women. Ossorio also acknowledges that some relationships work out—but perhaps not in a way that would please Betty Friedan. “A lot of people who are attracted to it are just looking for a woman who’s docile and obedient,” she says.</p>
<p>For some companies, such submissiveness is a selling point. Hand-In-Hand’s website trumpets the fact that its females are “unspoiled by feminism.” Company founder Weiner argues this form of chauvinism—like the mail-order bride business itself—is economically motivated. “You take a beautiful woman from the Czech Republic and you bring her into your home, she does all your cooking and cleaning and ironing,” he says. “At the end of the day, the service is free.” Hand-In-Hand estimates the potential savings of a homemaking wife at $150 per week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Housewives are now slaves</strong>. A man who marries a traditional woman who stays at home to manage the household is now regarded seen as a slaver. These are the kind of people that not only have a public platform to spread their filth, they see press in major publications like Business Week. To make matters worse, the same article is then republished, and when it is the headlines are a complete misrepresentation of the interview and business as a whole</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Here is the first headline</em>:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_03/b4211069050983.htm">The Mail-Order-Bride Trade Is Flourishing</a></p>
<p><em>Here is the second headline on the same article in a different publication</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/investment-banker-wharton-grad-new-york-london-hand-in-hand-joseph-weiner-january-2011-1">Former I-Banker’s Mail Order Bride Business Sells Women Who Are “Unspoiled By Feminism”</a></p>
<p><em>Here is the third headline</em></p>
<p><a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/01/every_guy_wants_an_indentured.html">Former Investment Banker’s Human-Trafficking Business Is Booming</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Laughable. Frikken laughable.</p>
<p>There is very little research that has been done on marriage between foreigners and nationals and their success rates for some reason. Seems like no one wants to touch it, or what is more likely, they cant get it through peer review. I think they would make for very interesting reading and I would not be surprised if we see stats very similar to what happened in Switzerland or what was uncovered by the USCIS. Not only were the marriages between foreign women and local men more successful, marriages between local women and foreign men were a disaster. Not the sort of thing feminized universities and organizations want to see published, thats for sure.</p>
<p>It has been effective too, because not only have the media done a fantastic job of convincing most people that these women are probably only after a green card, the men who bring them over tend to be abusive too. Its what drove legislation called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Marriage_Broker_Regulation_Act">IMBRA</a>, which has made it incredibly difficult for American men to marry mail order brides now.</p>
<p>Now, what does that say about the situation as a whole?</p>
<p>Can you imagine what sort of man resorts to a mail order bride? While I dont think its the case for all of them, I think in 95% of cases you are dealing with highly introverted guys who have always struggled with women. They are probably middle income to upper middle income, middle aged to elderly and either cant land a date or have been raped in divorce court already and are throwing the towel in. I also think that a lot of them will punch way above their weight, trying to marry women far too young or incredibly good looking women while they have very little going for them looks wise. I think that many dont understand the cultures of these women either, which makes it even harder on the marriage too. They are probably in the majority though decent guys just looking for companions.</p>
<p>So here we have average looking guys with moderate incomes and no ability with women who are still able not only marry hotter women than they would get at home, they are younger, more feminine and traditional too. They are landing far better women than they could if they stuck it out at home.</p>
<p><strong>The biggest farce of all? 80% of these arrangements are actually working according to statistics, while the rest of their countrymen will see 50% of their marriages end in divorce and family court rape.</strong></p>
<p>Now I know there are guys who marry foreign women that end up taking them to the cleaners. The thing is, these guys are being taken to the cleaners far less often than they would be if they married local women. And if they did take a chance on a local chick, she would be no where near the same quality a foreign wife would be. Not in looks or what she was prepared to bring to the table as a traditional wife.</p>
<p>I am also willing to bet that many of these “foreign women” who everyone tells horror stories about just so happen to be women who immigrated here when young or were sent to study in Western universities and colleges, and after a few years in our indoctrination camps they come out the other end far more fucked up than when they went in. They are not a complete representation of foreign women because their exposure to our culture is far deeper than someone who moved and lived there for a long period of time.</p>
<p>Maybe its time for men as a whole to sit back and think these things through a little more before jumping to the conclusions they do.</p>
