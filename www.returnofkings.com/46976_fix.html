<p>It seemed a typical September day in 490 B.C. Summer was turning into autumn, but the change in the seasons was probably not very apparent. Warmth still filled the air. So did fear. In fact, fear was probably the most palpable thing in the air that day, because this was not a typical September day at all.</p>
<p>Fear must have swept through every Greek man as he watched what was arrayed before him. From his safety on the heights overlooking the beach of Marathon, the Greek soldier saw the enormous host of the Persian King Darius. In their presence was the expelled Athenian Tyrant, Hippias. The Persians were present for only one reason – to subjugate Athens and punish its people for daring to take part in the revolt of the Ionian Greeks against their rule some years earlier. For this transgression, the mighty Persian King sought to punish tiny Athens, keeping the Athenians first in his thoughts by supposedly demanding a servant to remind him to “remember the Athenians” every time he took a meal.</p>
<p>Tiny does indeed describe Athens well, especially when considering the magnitude of the opponent the Athenian soldier faced on that September day. The Persian Empire stretched from the Indus to the Danube and from the Caspian Sea to Egypt. The equivalent today might be the entire United States ganging up on New York City.</p>
<p>Some in the city were so afraid that they considered surrendering immediately. And indeed, it was known that a large faction, including the sympathizers of Hippias, wanted to open the gates. The Persians banked on this too, and began to withdraw from the beach, leaving only a covering force.</p>
<p>Not one to waste such a golden opportunity, the Greek general Miltiades implored the other generals to take action, but many still did not dare. The fear among the soldiers had not missed many of their generals, and five refused to vote to attack, not wanting to leave the safety of their shelter. Miltiades, no doubt frustrated, turned to the decisive vote in the senior general, Callimachus, who had still not spoken. This is supposed to have been his passionate argument, one which has chilling similarities with what we are faced with today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With you it now rests, Callimachus, either to bring Athens under slavery, or by making her free to leave behind you for all the time that men shall live a memorial such as not even Harmodios and Aristogeiton have left. For now the Athenians have come to a danger the greatest to which they have ever come since they were a people; and on the one hand, if they submit to the Medes, it is determined what they shall suffer, being delivered over to Hippias, while on the other hand, if this city shall gain the victory, it may become the first of the cities of Hellas. How this may happen and how it comes to thee of all men to have the decision of these matters, I am now about to tell.</p>
<p>Of us the generals, who are ten in number, the opinions are divided, the one party urging that we fight a battle and the others that we do not fight. Now if we do not, I expect that some great spirit of discord will fall upon the minds of the Athenians and so shake them that they shall go over to the Medes; but if we fight a battle before any unsoundness appear in any part of the Athenian people, then we are able to gain the victory in the fight, if the gods grant equal conditions.</p>
<p>These things then all belong to you and depend on you; for if you attach yourself to my opinions, you have both a fatherland which is free and a native city which shall be the first among the cities of Hellas; but if you choose the opinion of those who are earnest against fighting, you shall have the opposite of those good things of which I told you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Callimachus assented. The Athenian hoplites, still no doubt feeling fear, turned it into aggression, charged forward, and, summoning powers they never knew they had, slaughtered the Persians. For this, Callimachus paid with his life, but it was a life not spent on frivolities, because with his vote, and the valor of the Greeks in the face of fear, the myth of Persian invincibility was shattered forever.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/499dbf5082da241327040b758fea5995.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-46977" alt="499dbf5082da241327040b758fea5995" src="http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/499dbf5082da241327040b758fea5995.jpg" width="450" height="300"></a></p>
<p>Persian interference in Greek affairs was cut short by only a decade, but the genie was out of the bottle. The progress of Persian arms could be blunted and repulsed.</p>
<p>Stories such as this span the ages. In 1809, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of the French, was master of Europe. Almost the entire continent was either occupied by or forcibly allied to France. It is also very likely that Napoleon could have negotiated a favorable peace settlement with Britain had he agreed to some demands such as removing his Continental System. Napoleon, in his arrogance, not only did not remove the system, he attempted to replace the Spanish king with his own brother and, when Russia defected, gathered a massive army to invade it.</p>
<p>The result was a “Spanish ulcer” and a “Russian hemorrhage.” Seeing that Napoleon was now vulnerable, almost all of Europe, inspired by their hatred of the French Emperor, and no longer pacified by fear, smelled blood and rose in revolt against their master. The result was the shattering Battles of Vitoria and Leipzig, the invasion of France itself, and the banishment of this swaggering pest. Waterloo was but an afterthought, an inevitable final defeat resulting from the making of too many enemies.</p>
<p>It took a generation to defeat Napol</p>
