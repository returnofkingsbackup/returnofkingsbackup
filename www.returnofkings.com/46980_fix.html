<p style="text-align: left;"> “Make the most of yourself… for that is all there is of you.” -Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p>At Return of Kings we tend to focus on the dysfunctional aspects of society. By focusing on these issues we acclimate ourselves to the decline of a once traditional and functional time.</p>
<p>It is clear many of these topics are based upon negativity, because our society is currently headed there. And, interestingly, negativity <b>can</b> be a powerful force that enlightens, educates and even motivates. But too much of it can cause destruction.</p>
<p>Human beings are dynamic and powerful creatures. Countless historic examples illustrate this power of human will. This is how our society was built; by people with visions of greatness, and of realities that were not yet theirs. Draw inspiration from this and refuse to let negativity affect you. The human mind is powerful enough to adapt to any situation it is presented. We can and should remain positively focused.</p>
<p>It may sound cliché, but there is power and potential within all of us. We can focus on this and revive the greatness of our forefathers, who built this society from the ground up.</p>
<p>The key to doing this lies in the power of The Grind.</p>
<h3>The Grind</h3>
<p>“When you’re not pursuing your goal, you are literally committing spiritual suicide.” -Les Brown</p>
<p>Solace is found in the redemptive powers of hard work and triumph. The motivation to achieve comes from a place of dissatisfaction, a desire to change the reality you are currently experiencing. That’s how everything in our current life came to fruition. It all started with varying degrees of dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The process of changing your reality starts with one step. The full change occurs over many small steps, lasting an extended period of time until the goal is achieved. This is The Grind. There is nothing I enjoy more than grunting out that last rep in the gym or finishing the last part of a writing piece. The feeling of overcoming something on a daily basis is unmatched. You feel cleansed, as if nothing else matters.</p>
<p>When you are on a mission, when you are striving to reach your goals and dreams, all emotional and spiritual matters fall into place. The power of The Grind should not wasted.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>“Time is what we want most, but what we use worst” -William Penn</p>
<p>Time is the most precious commodity. No amount of money, power, or influence will get it back. You have a predetermined amount and that is it.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Despite this fact, I would say that most people don’t value their time. They spend their days watching television, movies, or <em>Netflix</em> while browsing social media. They walk places as if they have nowhere to go. They live as if they will never die.</p>
<p>Do not be one of these people. Your time is your most precious asset, and you should treat it as such.</p>
<h3>Tunnel Vision</h3>
<p>In these turbulent times what can you do? How do you stay on your path when it seems the world is in turmoil?</p>
<p>You must become the center of the storm. Your job, your school, your girlfriend, and your friends are all supplementary. Do not watch the news. Do not watch television or movies. They’re all a distraction. If it takes away from your goals or does damage to your life, it should be cut out.</p>
<p>What we allow to enter our minds helps create our current reality. And our current reality will create our desired reality. So it follows that what you think will determine your future. The mind is a powerful thing, and so you must mold it to your benefit.</p>
<p>And this is a lot easier than you think. When you dedicate yourself to something, truly pouring your whole being into it, all else falls away. The Grind is powerful because you are living honestly. You are only doing what is most important to you. You see only your purpose, and your mind and body adjust accordingly. You feel complete as you empty all energy onto the battlefield. You know there is nothing more you can do at the moment to get closer to your dreams.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not solely to motivate. It is to reiterate the capabilities of not only you, but Return of Kings as a whole. There are plentiful amounts of intelligence and potential in the articles and comments I read here. If we all go after our goals with the vigor that I know we are capable of, we will thrive in these times.</p>
<p>I am not ready to succumb to cynicism just yet, and you shouldn’t be either. The path to achieving your goals is not an easy one, but it is worth it. You must be willing to see the positive, value your time, and shut out the noise.</p>
<p>And ultimately, you must embrace The Grind.</p>
