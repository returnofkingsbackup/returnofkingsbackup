<h4>1. <a href="http://www.pepermint.hr/en/index.html">Peppermint</a>
</h4>
<p>This is a compact club with two floors and lots of attractive girls. Prices are fair and there are many spots to approach from. You do run into typical club issues here, like loud noise and low attention spans, but if an American man is coming off the airplane he’ll be very satisfied with what he sees here. Visit starting on Thursday nights, but avoid it during the summer when there are a lot of fat and unruly British chicks.</p>

<h4>2. <a href="http://www.purgeraj.hr/">Purgeraj</a>
</h4>
<p>The biggest hipster venue in Zagreb. It has a loud dancefloor, a big bar room, and two outdoor seating areas. The ratio is usually bad (about two guys for every girl), but the guys here have absolutely no game and rarely approach at all. Instead they hope for a social introduction. The fact that so many people know each other is an advantage because you can talk to a girl and not be disturbed by her friend, who is content catching up with other people while you spit your game.</p>
<p>The biggest problem here is the lower level of talent, meaning you’ll have to stay for much longer to find cute women to approach than in a club. On the other hand, if you want to get a one-night stand, this is the place to do it, with the friendliest girls in Zagreb. The party starts on Thursday nights.</p>

<h4><span style="font-size: 1em;">3. <a href="http://www.mansion.hr/">Mansion</a></span></h4>
<p>This is a large club next to Lake Jarun, about a 13 minute cab ride from the center. It’s the best place to be on Wednesday night when they have their hip hop party. On that night the ratio is good and the girls can be somewhat friendly. The club is split into two parts, one with a dance floor and then another with a large center bar. It’s the latter spot that I liked because it wasn’t too loud.</p>

<p>I had a lot of luck here getting numbers and random makeouts but not much in the way of fast bangs because of logistics. Since the Lake is far, most girls come sharing a ride, so there is no way to extract them. But on Wednesday night it’s worth a visit (party gets going around midnight)</p>

<h4>4. <a href="http://gallery.hr/">Gallery</a>
</h4>
<p>Just a stone’s throw from Mansion, this club has the hottest girls in Zagreb, hands down. It’s a snobby venue with table service and big groups, but a night here and you will happily renounce your American citizenship. I recommend you come on Friday or Saturday night around midnight to check it out and be able to brag to your friends back home on what you saw. What I liked about Gallery is that it stayed open later than Mansion, so I’d sneak inside the back entrance when no one was looking and do a few more approaches before going home to masturbate.</p>

<h4>5. <a href="http://alcatraz.pondi.hr/">Alcatraz</a>
</h4>
<p>This is a tiny, dank, dark pit of a bar that attracts a large street party right in front, a la the Brazilian style. The vibe is welcoming but you’ll have to move fast if you see girls talking without guys. Don’t be shy to casually insert yourself into conversations with mixed sets.</p>

<p><em>Honorable mention:</em> <a href="http://www.maraschinobar.hr/zd/">Maraschino</a>. On the weekends this seems to be a warm-up spot for girls before they hit the club. The talent was high but horrible logistics prevent you from putting in approaches. I heard the basement gets packed and awesome but it never happened while I was there.</p>
