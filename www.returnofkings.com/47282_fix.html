<p>Feminists are trying to take down Real Social Dynamics pick-up coach Julian Blanc for a video he posted, in which Julien pulls Asian women toward his crotch while repeatedly shouting “pickachu.” They’ve already gotten RSD banned from several major hotels, and shut down an RSD event, attacking and hitting RSD instructor Max. Those behind #TakeDownJulienBlanc say that what Julien does in the video is sexual harassment, and ask why other men don’t police men like Julien Blanc?</p>
<p>Well feminists, I’ve been waiting for this a long time, and it’s finally come. I’ve been waiting for the day you’d ask us to bring back patriarchy.</p>
<p>Now, I know some of you will hate me for suggesting that wanting men to create standards of conduct for other men is patriarchy, but if you pay attention, I’ll give you everything you need to actually <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23takedownjulienblanc&amp;src=tyah">#TakeDownJulienBlanc</a>, straight from an insider in one of the most anti-feminist, pro-game websites on the internet.</p>
<h3>The Controversy Behind #TakeDownJulienBlanc</h3>
<p>The controversy behind #TakeDownJulienBlanc was started when Julien posted a free tour video of a public speaking event he did in Japan, in which Julien said:</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/grV1iDns87s.html" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<blockquote><p>When you go to Tokyo…if you’re a white male, you can do what you want. Just grab her, pull her in. She’ll giggle. Just say PIKACHU or POKEMON or something to take the pressure off. I’m romping through the streets (of Tokyo) just grabbing girls and it’s like (motions) head on dick (pfft) head on dick, yelling ‘PIKACHU’ with a Pikachu shirt on…Every foreigner who is white does this. When you see that one foreigner in the crowd in Tokyo and your eyes will lock and you know that he knows and he knows that and it’s this guilty look like you both fucked a hooker or something.</p></blockquote>
<p>The video was seen on Tumblr by<span style="font-size: 13px;"> Washington D.C.-based Chinese feminist </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="https://twitter.com/JennLi123">Jennifer Li</a>, who started the hashtag #TakeDownJulienBlanc in response to what she heard. In this video, she <span style="font-size: 13px;">explains her reasons for starting the hashtag:</span></p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/30ZWKn6JBxg.html" height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Jennifer embodies many feminist stereotypes. She was on tumblr at 2am on a Saturday night instead of having a social life. Her cat wanders into the frame two minutes into the video. She is slightly overweight, and lives in Washington D.C. But one comment she makes stands out:</p>
<blockquote><p>The responsibility shouldn’t be on the women. it should be on these nasty ass men.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jennifer doesn’t want to fight her her own battles. She wants a men to protect her. And she isn’t alone. Many of the #TakeDownJulienBlanc tweets echo the same sentiment. Why aren’t men stopping men like this?</p>
<h3>Feminists Need Patriarchy To Save Them From Julien Blanc</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">It used to be if a man was abusing or harassing women, the older men of that community would get together and teach the young man a lesson. Fathers in particular would teach their sons to be respectful of women. This system of men maintaining order was known as patriarchy. The word </span>patriarch<span style="font-size: small;"> literally means rule by fathers.</span></p>
<p>Now, in the absence of patriarchy and male organizations, women only have ineffective government organizations, Twitter, and change.org petitions to turn to. What little success the feminists behind #TakeDownJulienBlanc have had is in turning to men—working class men like hotel managers, event organizers, and government officials—to help them shut down events.</p>
<p>In her video, Jennifer says “if he [Julien] were to yell Pikachu at me, I would fucking whip out a taser and go Pikachu on his motherfucking dick.” Would you really, Jennifer? Do you carry a taser? Are you so frightened of men that you carry a weapon at all times? Or is this just a violent power fantasy you indulge in, in the absence of any real power? You live in Washington D.C. If you don’t feel safe walking the streets in the city with the most government of any place in the world, who can you turn to for protection?</p>
<p>The hashtag #TakeDownJulienBlanc is a cry for help, a damsel in distress trope. I say this not to be mean, because I truly want each and every woman tweeting that to feel safe and secure, but because I believe what will make those women most secure is being surrounded by strong men, who’ve been raised by their fathers to behave honorably and justly. Patriarchy is what make women feel safe, which is why survey after survey says that conservative married women are the most happy and <a href="http://www.jiss.org/documents/volume_2/issue_1/JISS_2011_Sexual_Satisfaction_in_Marriage.pdf">sexually</a> <a href="http://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=sspa_10">satisfied</a> demographic in America.</p>
<p>But don’t think I’m letting Julien off the hook. We’ll get to his behavior next.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/fbcoverpimpfbbw.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-47301" alt="fbcoverpimpfbbw" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/fbcoverpimpfbbw.png" width="477" height="177"></a></p>
<h3>How did Julien Blanc become Julien Blanc?</h3>
<p>Julien’s behavior didn’t evolve in a vacuum. It was rewarded over years of practice and experimentation. In <a href="http://youtu.be/cUzZxPZep-g?list=UU66gDMMJsOmFsRaneAlfSGg">one video</a>, Julien says that as a young man he couldn’t even start a conversation with girls. During his first approach, he ran away after a few seconds of conversation. He was not born as the man feminists are protesting today.</p>
<p>Much of Julien’s mindset can be attributed to being raised without a patriarch. In her video, #TakeDownJulienBlanc creator Jennifer Li says:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is messed up about this guys behavior is that one – he knows that what he is doing is wrong because he says in his video, “I didn’t know how much I could get away with,” and you don’t say I’m going to get away with something , if you don’t think that what you’re doing is wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>“I didn’t know how much I could get away with,” is <span style="font-size: 13px;"> the voice of a child who was never taught boundaries. It is the voice of a child who never had a father to teach him right from wrong, or to give him meaningful challenges by which to discover the limits and abilities of his own powers.</span></p>

</div>
<p>Other RSD coaches have said that for Julien, the drama is the sex. Julien will actually continue to fuck with a girl he knows will go home with him because he enjoys creating an emotional roller coaster that more than getting laid. If that doesn’t sound like behavior learned from women, I don’t know what is.</p>
<p>Years before #TakeDownJulienBlanc, Julien made <a href="http://youtu.be/kgGJebRifQE">videos</a> where he said his favorite way to open girls was to point and call them a dog. While this opener would offend women, it got their attention. Julien’s game is to troll women and then win them over by reframing his actions. If you’re offended by what he does, congrats, his game worked.</p>
<p>When Jezebel did a hit piece fellow RSD coach <a href="http://youtu.be/m9iWqQX80CA">Jeffy Allen</a>, Julien was jealous because he wanted to be the subject of that much drama. He emailed offensive messages to Jezebel editors hoping they’d cover him. I have no doubt that Julien is relishing much of the controversy that surrounds him now. No one would give him attention when he was a fatherless young man who wanted girls to talk to him, and now he’s got his own hashtag.</p>

<h3>Feminists Responses Show They Don’t Understand The Problem</h3>
<p>Real Social Dynamics is the largest pickup company is the world. They are a million-dollar business. They have a bootcamp model, meaning that men pay them directly for in-field coaching. They don’t have advertisers or corporate sponsors who can pull support. If you wanted to stop them, you’d have to reach their customers. You have to convince men that you have something better to offer.</p>
<p>What are women doing instead? Making violent death threats against Julien:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killJulien.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-47297" alt="killJulien" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killJulien.png" width="441" height="157" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killJulien.png 630w, wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killJulien-620x220.png 620w" sizes="(max-width: 441px) 100vw, 441px"></a></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/castratejulien.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-47303" alt="castratejulien" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/castratejulien.png" width="440" height="132"></a></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killprotest.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-47299" alt="killprotest" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/killprotest.png" width="443" height="560"></a></p>
<p>One protestor even physically assaulted RSD coach Max on camera at an event in Melbourne, Australia:</p>
<p><iframe src="../vine.co/v/OeJmIAYM5Fa/embed/simple.html" height="600" width="600" frameborder="0"></iframe><script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="../platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js" async=""></script></p>
<p>The RSD students were <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/julien-blanc-protests-shut-down-seminar-given-by-his-buddy/story-fni0fit3-1227115219636?nk=57451fe9f20c28bd0bac4979e1cae0af">forced to leave</a> the Melbourne event after feminist protestors surrounded the boat they were meeting in. Max later told <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/julien-blanc-protests-shut-down-seminar-given-by-his-buddy/story-e6frg6n6-1227115219636?nk=0c757160878869b05ec281fafa39389d">news</a>, “we were actually fearing our safety and that’s really not cool.” #TakeDownJulienBlanc have said they plan to stage similar protests at future RSD events.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t it ironic that in their efforts to stop men from harassing them, women have made death threats and committed assault?</em></p>
<p>“Well he deserves it!” cry feminist protestors in their tweets. If these were men tweeting similar statements to a female speaker she would receive massive sympathetic mainstream coverage. However, because the protestors and media seem find Julien’s videos so reprehensible, they believe he deserves to have his life threatened, and his friends assaulted. When I see Julien, I don’t see a monster. Julien is what men become when they are raised by only women, and told women’s attention is what defines their worth.</p>
<p>If feminists truly wanted to #TakeDownJulienBlanc and keep men like him from ever becoming a problem again, they would make sure their sons grew up with fathers who were present active parts of their life. They would give attention to men they respect, rather than only engaging men who choke them and call them “dog.” And they would encourage the men in their lives to band together and lead their communities. If you want to #TakeDownJulienBlanc then you need to #BringBackPatriarchy.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since publishing this article, Julien Blanc’s Australian visa has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2014/nov/07/protesters-force-us-pick-up-artist-julien-blanc-to-quit-australian-tour">revoked</a> by immigration minister Scott Morrison. This is the old ruling white man feminists are cheering on as their savior:</p>

<p>Victorian police commissioner Ken Lay also made a statement <a href="http://www.vicpolicenews.com.au/cops-and-bloggers/4914-ccp-ken-lay-comments-on-a-pickup-artist.html">condemning</a> Julien’s work, labeling it “deeply disturbing and offensive.” Here is the old white police man gun owner feminists asked to solve their problems for them:</p>

<p>I couldn’t have picked two better images of Patriarchy myself.</p>
