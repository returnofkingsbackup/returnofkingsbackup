<p>As an African American male it took me a good long while to come to grips with the fact that my skin tone changes a lot of things when gaming western females. There’s nothing special or unique about me, but it would be silly not to acknowledge that my race does have certain advantages and disadvantages with regards to bedding women.</p>
<p>Being raised in a military family, race didn’t seem to play a role in much of anything on base. People were judged strictly on rank and credentials which were posted next to doors of family living quarters beneath the family name. Because of this I was almost completely oblivious to the racial issues of the outside world until I became a civilian in my teens.</p>
<p>When I started out in game I had that same adolescent mentality. Never once did I ask myself “How does being black factor into my success with girls?” I knew there were some differences, but not enough to make me think I had to make any major adjustments, so I just dove in headfirst (which was the right way to do it). But as soon as I became cognizant of the racial components of game and tweaked my approach accordingly, my conquests with the second sex improved considerably.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://images.sodahead.com/polls/002516939/4845204311_BLACKANDWHITEMRB_answer_10_xlarge.jpeg" alt="" width="350" height="340"></p>
<p>Over the years I noticed a few differences in the way women react when approached by black men as opposed to other races. There are all sorts of studies, surveys, and research out there to back up my observations (Google them) but this article is based on personal experiences, stories from lifelong friends, and things I’ve seen throughout life post-red pill awakening.</p>
<p>Qualifier: This article pertains to gaming non-ghetto, westernized women of all races as a black man <em>with game. </em>Now that that’s out of the way,<em> </em>here are the advantages and disadvantages of practicing the Venusian arts from a black man’s point of view.</p>
<h3>Women Often Assume Black Men Are Natural Alphas</h3>
<p>While most white men in the Anglo world have to prove their sexual fitness to women (on the “alpha fucks” side of hypergamy) there’s an unspoken sentiment that black men who are at or near the extreme poles of the financial hierarchy (wealthy and poor) are natural alphas. The hip hop culture, ghettos, and black professional athletes make compelling arguments for that assumption but the truth is no one really knows for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> This assumption will push women to shit test as a function of confirmation as opposed to discovery or qualification. They will poke and prod a little to make sure you live up to the perceived reputation (to what degree depends largely on frame), but women tend to give black men the benefit of the doubt as far as congruency goes. Their shit tests are more benign, at least from the onset of courtship.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> If you <em>do</em> fail a shit test, you’re beyond finished. When everything around a woman tells her a certain type of male has natural alpha tendencies her southern regions will dry up faster than a salt-covered slug if she uncovers any remnants of beta penchants. <a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/10/103176/2514391-354955135_f1245a6470_371x414.jpg"><em>Nothing is more unattractive than a black beta male.</em></a> Most times when I’ve failed a single shit test I have rarely been given a chance to redeem myself, if at all. Even when my game was air-tight to that point, if I took the smallest bite of that beta chum I could almost see the attraction drain out of her body.</p>
<p>Even though black men seemingly have the “assumed alpha” advantage when approaching, the margin for error is razor-thin. Speaking from personal experience, getting blown out for the slightest missteps motivated me to tighten up my game rather quickly and effectively, but only because I was highly motivated to be successful with girls. Thinner-skinned men often drop out at this stage because of the sheer volume of rejection early on in their womanizing development.</p>
<h3>Girls Expect Black Men To Push For Sex</h3>
<p>The “natural alpha myth” impressed upon Anglo women about black men sets a lot of expectations in terms of what to expect upon being approached by us. They assume we’ll be forthright, bold, and fearless. They also expect black men to escalate the interaction toward sex more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> It takes a tremendous amount of pressure off. Knowing that women expect this means that if they’re receptive to game, give up the digits, and don’t flake out on the ensuing arranged meet-up, they are straight up DTF.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage: </strong>Day game is <em>very</em> difficult. It’s not easy to work past the slut shields with women who hold this assumption. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not impossible. But ultra-smooth game is absolutely necessary when attempting to strike up a seemingly innocuous conversation with a high sexual market value woman in order to gain trust and build attraction. Granted, most men (regardless of race) have to do this anyway, as good looking girls usually assume the reason most men talk to them is to get into their panties. But they’re damn near 100% certain of the intent when being chatted up by a brother, so they fortify their defenses accordingly.</p>
<p>This presumption puts all our cards are out on the table. Women can either fold or double down right then and there, because in their minds sex is inevitable when they meet up with a black man. But like I said before, it’s a major plus on the “alpha fucks” side, which leads me to my next observation which is that…</p>
<h3>Black Men Are <em>Rarely</em> Thought Of As LTR Material</h3>
<p>Today’s American female is encouraged to ride the cock carousel until she’s well into her 30s and then settle down with a beta schlub to fulfill the other side of her dualistic sexual imperative. Most of the time that unlucky sap is a white male—especially if the carousel passenger is a high-value female.</p>

<p>The U.S. has come a long way as far as the overall acceptance of interracial dating is concerned (specifically between black men and white women), but it still carries a measure of taboo however underground it may be. For that reason black men are mainly viewed as a “phase” when seen with a younger woman who isn’t black or a “How Stella Got Her Groove Back” type of fling when seen with an older woman of a different race.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://ionehellobeautiful.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/black-couple-getting-married-at-home.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="260"></p>
<p>Outside of the wealthy, it is highly uncommon for women to think of black men as a long-term partners. The perceived lack of future provisioning potential and social stigma are major deterrents to women with options as far as marriage or settling down is concerned (the obvious exception being black women, who chase black men like fat kids chase ice cream trucks). However, non-black women in this country are mystified by the lore of the sexual prowess of the black male. They’d by lying if they didn’t admit they weren’t a little curious about the “once you go black you don’t go back” adage.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage:</strong> It leads to a lot of easy notches for black men—especially with today’s pro-carousel woman. Obviously not all black men are porn stars between the sheets and equipped with  19″ cocks that make women squirt like faucets. Women who have experience with more than one know this. But the hamsters of those who have never crossed over just can’t help themselves. <em>They have to know</em>. So as soon as the opportunity presents itself to a woman who is even a little curious they make themselves readily available for the taking.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> Unless you believe in ridiculous notions like unicorns, “The American Dream,” and NAWALT, none.</p>
<p>Though Western women seldom fantasize about the suburban white picket fence life with black men, a good number of them do fantasize about short-term trysts. That makes some of them just about as easy to game as <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/31153/8-essential-rules-for-banging-a-single-mom" target="_blank">single mothers</a>. Especially if they indicate they’re looking to “broaden their horizons.”</p>
<p>Another advantage to not being considered for long term partnership means…</p>
<h3>Very Little Wasted Time</h3>
<p>Because I know I’m not often thought of as LTR material I’ve resigned myself to the fact my race makes me little more than a mere novelty. My sexual market value is of the “exotic” variety more often than not. This means that some women definitely want to give men like me a try (at least once), some do not, and some are curious as is the case with all novelties.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage: </strong>Very little wasted time. When I approach girls, day or night, they usually make it clear very quickly whether or not they’re interested. If they are, they start shooting off rapid fire IOIs and shamelessly flirt away. If they’re not they don’t much waste much time leading me on. They shut me down on the spot. I’ve consistently witnessed this firsthand with my buddies (we always have a good laugh with each other if one of us gets blown out in front of the crew) and throughout my daily life.</p>
<p><strong>Disadvantage:</strong> A <em>lot</em> of rejection. Most (I’d put the number at two out of three) high-SMV chicks just aren’t into black guys. That’s just how it is. So having a taste for high-quality girls can cause a temporary slip in standards when going through a dry streak. I’m as guilty as anyone out there for occasionally bottom-feeding during a slump.</p>
<p>The silver lining to this disadvantage is that it destroys approach anxiety pretty damn quick. Less wasted time means more approaches over the course of any given day, but that also means more swings and misses. I’ve been turned down by a shitload of women over the years, especially in the fledgling stages of learning game. But getting rejected by a high number of women early in my development decreased my learning curve which eliminated my ego and made me completely fearless.</p>
<h3>Takeaway</h3>
<p>One of my best friends is a white guy I’ve known for nearly 20 years. He’s a tall, great looking guy with a great job. Every Anglo-slut’s dream. When we go out for a night on the town he consistently pulls quality chicks much easier than I do, even though my game level is much higher than his. He’s got a little game, but he naturally attracts women to him so he hasn’t really had to hone his skills in the art of seduction. I always have to work a little bit harder to pull than he does, which is perfectly okay because I now have a deeper understanding of how the game works.</p>
