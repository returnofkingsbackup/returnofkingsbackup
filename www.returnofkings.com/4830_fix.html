<p>For anyone who tuned into the Superbowl, the above commercial from GoDaddy will be familiar. You’re probably also recalling the fact that the commercial likely struck a nerve with your thoughts. For anyone who didn’t witness it. Thanks to this ad however, I realized that everything feminism claims in regards to supporting betas and empowering women has now been abolished. Yes, sexual marketing, a primary target used for men, has now been turned around in a way to support manly ideas. God bless America!</p>
<p>I’ll address the feminist side rather quickly. The average feminist is going to say the following two statements. First, that the use of sexuality is an evil ploy and that this ad finally has it backfire against men. Second, feminists will likely state that this empowers the idea of being a different kind of male and garnering success. Both are false statements.</p>
<p>The truth is as simple as the advertisement is. It not only garnered enough attention for GoDaddy to have another unforgettable commercial, but it also pointed out what the manosphere has been saying for years, that women do not want betas. While watching <em>The Daily Show</em>, I witnessed John Stewart poking fun at the commercial and the negative backlash towards it from the public by initially stating,</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-february-4-2013/totally-non-gay-all-male-tackle-fest-xlvii-feat--beyonce---violence---consumerism">“Oh really, that ad was controversial, oh because she was kissing a Jew, is that why”</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He then quickly followed up his statement with a pretend correction where he stated the obvious.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-february-4-2013/totally-non-gay-all-male-tackle-fest-xlvii-feat--beyonce---violence---consumerism">“The source was apparently America’s belief that affection should only take place between… looks equals”</a></p></blockquote>
<p>This statement is 100% truth, and helps to prove everything the manosphere has been saying for years, that women are just as shallow as men. This commercial also helped prove the 10 scale system which indicates you cannot go more than 2 points up or down in attractiveness for a partner. So after years of arguing that the 10 scale is in fact real and necessary, there is now certifiable evidence thanks to the otherwise useless invention that is Twitter.</p>

<p>Additionally, Calvin Klein ran a female targeted sexual ad, which really accomplished nothing other than showing a hardly clothed muscular man posing. What’s great about the advertisement is that it further discredits the idea of feminism saying they don’t want alphas. The positive rants I saw on Facebook  and Twitter following the airing of the commercial further supported the idea that women are just as shallow as men. A quick search of on Twitter using #CalvinKlein, revealed the following:</p>

<p>So there you have it, thanks to two simple Superbowl ads, the entire basis of feminism has been discredited. Women want what the manosphere has said they want, and that’s an alpha. When presented with an attractive female kissing a beta the world, including women, were repulsed. Manosphere 1, Feminism ZERO.</p>
