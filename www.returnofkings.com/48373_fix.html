<p>I’m feeling very fortunate to have formal employment which covers my necessary expenses, with some leftover money to spare for rainy days or the odd spot of overseas travel. Being a small-time online entrepreneur helps too, and it can (hopefully) allow me to live someplace warm and modestly priced in <a href="http://www.worldtinderwomen.com/tinder-women-rio-de-janeiro-brazil-bikini-attire/" target="_blank">Latin America</a> someday.</p>
<p>But what about the tens of millions of Americans who are not anywhere close to having my comparatively fortunate circumstances? Long-term unemployment (or underemployment) is a major issue for those who are stuck in the American vortex, with seemingly no options to escape. Unfortunately, I have some bad news for many of these people, and of course the regular readers of RoK.</p>
<p>Are you ready to swallow the red pill? Of course you are, that’s why you’re here…</p>
<h3>You Are Becoming Irrelevant</h3>
<p>To grumpy taxpayers, the mainstream media, and political and business elites, you are a pest. They see you as a hopeless smartphone and pornography-addicted zombie who lives in “your mother’s basement.” They see you only as a taker, a moocher, and a “gibs me dat” type of person. A person who just does not want to work or contribute to society.</p>
<p>However, the “get a job” naysayers simply cannot comprehend the truth about the rapid changes in our civilization. There are currently more people alive today than at any point in human history (roughly <a href="http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/" target="_blank">7.2 billion</a> as of 2014) and yet the need for financially compensated human labor is dropping at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Outsourcing, automation, robotics, drone deliveries, smartphone apps, and self-service checkouts are all contributing to less need for paid labor. But if technology is supposed to make our lives better and we live in a for-profit capitalist economic system, where is the wealth generation (for the masses) supposed to come from?</p>

<h3>There Is No More Entry-Level Work</h3>
<p>Many individuals have never been affected by long-term unemployment. Good for them. But they are clueless to one very defining aspect of the modern employment landscape: how can the unemployed, or new to the workforce, get work when they are not even given the chance?</p>
<p>You can drop your standards to rock bottom, minimum wage and part time hours, right away – and what will you get from the 24-year-old HR girl who holds your entire financial future, and by proxy your future sex life, all in her hands? <em>“Aren’t you overqualified for this? Won’t you just leave the minute a better job comes around?”</em></p>
<p>Or here’s another one. You can drop your standards to rock bottom, minimum wage and part time hours, and you will find is that even for the most simplistic jobs, employers want a ridiculous amount of previous experience.</p>
<p>Retail? You need 3 years of recent experience to restock shelves, scan price tags, hand over some change, give an insincere “have a nice day,” and just generally hold the fort.</p>
<p>Picking orders in a warehouse? Six months of recent experience. That is, six months of recent experience which a healthy and active young adult will obviously never get.</p>
<p>Seating diners in a run-of-the-mill restaurant chain? Three years of similar experience.</p>
<p>This is exactly why many teenagers and 20-somethings cannot find work: the job market has simply eliminated the concept of an entry level job.</p>
<p>It seems like there is almost zero tolerance in allowing a job seeker just a few shifts of OJT (on the job training) in order to acclimatize to a new line of work. All an advertiser has to do is require one year of experience as a dishwasher, and anyone outside of those currently working as dishwashers are out of the selection pool.</p>
<p>Oh, and they always want somebody who will “hit the ground running,” which is another cute buzz phrase which routinely makes it to print.</p>
<p>In today’s job market, employers can set these ludicrously high standards precisely because there is such an overabundance of available labor. Adults with families to feed are working these jobs which were once almost the exclusive property of teenagers, college students, or just the outright unambitious.</p>
<p>The underemployed or unemployed man cannot get a better paying or “living wage” job without entry-level experience, so that means he will likely remain in his “mother’s basement” or on welfare. But here is where things get strange—sometimes it’s better to not even be working at all than get dead-end entry-level jobs:</p>

<h3>But It’s Not Your Fault</h3>
<p>People who have either been employed their whole lives, settled into a career in more prosperous times, or have the political and business connections to easily procure jobs, do not identify with your plight. They will tell you to go “pavement pounding” like they did back in the good ol’ days, and that you need to “pull yourself up by your bootstraps” or something cute like that.</p>
<p>They are truly out of whack with how serious the unemployment situation is across the country. That would be an awful lot of “bootstraps” that need to be pulled up in order to give 90 million+ working age Americans a job.</p>
<p><img title="pull yourself up by your bootstraps - long term unemployment" src="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps-300x201.gif" alt="pull yourself up by your bootstraps - long term unemployment" width="300" height="201"></p>
<p>The fact is no matter how skilled someone is or how good his résumé reads, there will be untold millions of people who will <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/2014/04/05/truth-unemployment-rate/" target="_blank">never get a job in their profession</a>. This will be due to an oversupply of labor, outsourcing, and the takeover of robotics which is vastly decreasing the need for labor which carries a pulse.</p>
<p>Eventually there will be a large and permanent underclass of good-natured, un-tattooed (oh my God, brace yourself for the SJW’s!), un-pierced, well-spoken, and well-educated people who will be unable to procure work. Even though they did exactly what they were told to do by their teachers, parents, political leaders, and society in general.</p>
<p>The psychological (and of course the financial) effects of long-term unemployment can be devastating. Regardless of these highly unfortunate circumstances, though, keep plugging along and gradually work towards improving your future prospects. And to all the naysayers who say things like “it’s because your not trying hard enough,” tell them to take these “bootstraps” and shove it.</p>

<h3>Thoughts &amp; Suggestions</h3>
<p>It’s just stupefying how utterly out of touch our politicians and media have become about the long-term unemployment problem. Rapidly growing percentages of Americans are suffering in a state of severe, abject poverty. The <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/2013/11/05/wage-crisis-the-usas-new-underclass/" target="_blank">middle class is disappearing</a>, wages are plummeting, jobs are vanishing, people are hanging on for bare survival in a manner even worse than what could be fathomed in Dickensian London. There is real and hard-core desperation and fear around us. Cities trying to keep up appearances are even <a href="http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/573143/20141118/arnold-abbott-feeding-homeless-love-thy-neighbour.htm" target="_blank">banning and arresting people for feeding the homeless</a> now.</p>
<p>So what can you do?</p>
<p>If you are college educated, single, and don’t have any children, I would highly consider looking into teaching English in South Korea for awhile. These positions are still in high demand, pay adequately, and you are often provided with your own apartment for free as part of a deal sweetener. The internet speeds and pervasiveness of WiFi in South Korea are also kick-ass, and it’s not a bad place to be a budding online entrepreneur as a side business.</p>
<p>If that’s not an option, look into online entrepreneurship in general. If you can manage to earn (somehow, someway) $10,000 per year online, you can live and have the same quality of life in numerous other countries as you would in the United States earning $40,000 per year. Don’t believe me? Look into places like <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/2014/07/05/time-to-expatriate-consider-bolivia/" target="_blank">Cochabamba, Bolivia</a> where a decent apartment in a nice neighborhood can be yours for $250 per month!</p>
<p>If you have a trade, look and see if your skills are required in Australia, Germany, or Scandinavia someplace. It may surprise you as an American that a lot of these countries actually have higher wages, and a higher quality of life than the United States in general.</p>
<p>However, the saddest part is that we really shouldn’t have to leave the United States. Weren’t we all promised in our “everybody gets a trophy” little league sports huddle-ups that we could all be rockstars and multi-millionaires someday? You know, you can achieve anything if you just “put your mind to it” or some feel-good shit like that?</p>
<p>Then I was offered the red pill, and I came to the realization that we have been emotionally and spiritually hijacked all throughout our <a href="http://www.ingeniouspress.com/2013/12/28/cultural-marxism-corruption-america/" target="_blank">Cultural Marxist spoon-fed youths</a>. That makes me very angry, and it should make you angry too. You can either watch it affect your life, or choose to do something about it.</p>
