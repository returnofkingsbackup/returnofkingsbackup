<p>Younger men face two simple biological realities:</p>
<p><strong>1. Older men are generally more desirable to women than their younger selves.</strong> Women prefer men above their age range.</p>
<p><strong>2. Younger women are generally more desirable than their older counterparts</strong>. Men, if given a choice, generally prefer to date women below them in age. Men in all age ranges are essentially competing most fiercely for women in one particular age range, generally 18-29. Everyone’s competing for the same prize.</p>
<p>These realities ensure that younger men are always vulnerable to competition to older males who (being on average more experienced, affluent and confident versions of themselves) have an edge with younger girls.</p>
<p>Older women, meanwhile, are vulnerable to competition from younger females, a dynamic frequently referred to as “trading in for a new model”, or something to that end. Women are well aware of this, and do everything in their power to guard against it (including shaming). This leads to an important demographic intersection with fertility rates.</p>
<p><strong>A. When fertility rates are increasing</strong>, things are good for young men because there is a larger supply of younger women relative to the supply of older men (who, in a scenario where fertility rates are going up, would have been born in years of lower fertility and would therefore not be as numerous).</p>
<p>This means that there are more opportunities for younger guys to compete for the pool of younger girls their older counteparts are also shooting for. The older guys will still get plenty of touches (they’ve got far too many advantages over their younger selves), but there’ll be a larger supply to keep everyone happy. Overall, this is great for them.</p>
<p><strong>B. When fertility rates are decreasing</strong>, things get much rougher. This means that the older generations (born in a period of higher fertility) outnumber the young. That, of course, means a larger supply of older men to younger women. Younger guys thus face much stiffer competition for their female peers than they otherwise would, and they’re left at a major disadvantage (they simply lack, on average, the same degree of experience/maturity/confidence/etc that their older selves will have in 3, 4 or 5+ years).</p>

</div>
<p>Attitudes are also impacted by this. In a decreasing fertility rate scenario, you’ve got a larger number of more attractive men (older dudes) pursuing a smaller number of the more attractive women (younger girls). The younger girls get more confident as a result of this-they now not only can choose from the more attractive men within their own age group, but not they also have a better shot at quality men 4, 5, or even 10 years their senior (some women will even consider men further above that range, though this is less common in some cultures).</p>
<p>This abundance mentality among young women compounds the difficulty for younger men, who already faced a numerical disadvantage. Now, to get with women in their age group, they need to meet the higher standard those girls now expect from their male peers, a standard enforced not only by the media/feminism/etc, but by the simple demographic realities that put more quality older men in front of them. Only the cream of the crop (the younger dudes with the highest degrees of confidence, maturity, sociability, physical fitness and status) manage to easily clear this hurdle.</p>
<p>Most western societies are in this stage of development right now (declining fertility over the past decade or so), and the effects are being felt.</p>
<p>How can a young guy use this information? Your reality on the ground can change drastically as societies move between these competing scenarios and fertility (or, for that matter, immigration) rates fluctuate. A society considered a virtual “pussy paradise” a mere decade ago (i.e. <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-17163.html">Brazil</a>) can change quickly as <a href="http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&amp;idim=country:BRA&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=fertility+rate+brazil">fertility rates decline</a> and the supply of younger women goes with it.</p>
<p>Similarly, realities on the ground can improve as some parts of the world see fertility increases that create a surplus of younger women for men to pursue down the road. It is up to the individual to put himself into the best position to be one of those men.</p>
<p>The sexual marketplace is a volatile place. Your fertile hunting ground today can be a dead zone tomorrow thanks to demographic shifts, and vice versa. Knowing this, guys should be careful to keep abreast of these changes and shifts as they happen, and be ready to move and/or adapt accordingly. Their romantic lives may depend on it.</p>
