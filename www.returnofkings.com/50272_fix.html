<p>Video games have come a long way from being just a simple form of entertainment that could only represent its imagery in the crudest form imaginable. Not only did playing the first video games require a lot of imagination, but it also often demanded arcane knowledge of the in-game rules. Because of this, video games were labeled as “that thing only <a href="http://www.cad.com.au/images/misc/computer-nerd.jpg">nerds</a> enjoy” and were mostly a solitary activity.</p>
<p>Nowadays, video games are a legit business. It’s no longer a problem to play or watch games together. In fact, large groups would get together and watch Starcraft 2 matches being played. Video games have also become an art form that can provide the most vivid scenes with ease and give characters a profound sense of identity through storytelling and cut scenes. Still, some game developers have opted to forgo exotic worlds and instead put the player into the shoes of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nPxKSVP2g">goat</a> or a criminal. Rockstar does the latter with its Grand Theft Auto series.</p>
<h3>“Follow the train, CJ!”</h3>
<p>GTA has a fairly straightforward premise: you are a thug in a colorful world, there is no God, do what thou wilt. This means the freedom to run amok until cops inevitably show up in large numbers and overwhelm the player, ending his virtual thuggery face down on the pavement, in the pool of blood. Life in GTA was always short, brutal and hilariously fun. The plot was generally weaksauce, but luckily the action made up for it heftily.</p>
<p>As the technology advanced, GTA also became more and more elaborate. Early on in the series, it was possible to merely kill, rob and terrorize people, but with GTA V you can fuck hookers, kill them, or fuck and then kill them to get your money back. This particular bit rustled a lot of SJW jimmies.</p>
<p>The result was a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/target-withdraw-grand-theft-auto-5-this-sickening-game-encourages-players-to-commit-sexual-violence-and-kill-women">petition</a> by three former sex workers, who expressed their concern with violence that can be done on virtual women by virtual criminals because “it grooms boys to see violence against women as acceptable.” That’s the three magic words “violence against women” that make all demands reasonable. The context doesn’t matter, just as long as it’s vaguely connected to violence against women.</p>

<p><em>Fact: 100% of people eating with spoons will die, hence spoons kill people.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, Target Australia decided to listen to this idiotic petition and remove GTA V from its shelves. New Zealand’s equivalent, The Warehouse, did the same and also removed all 18+ video games and movies.</p>
<p>Kotaku and similar faux-gaming websites rejoiced at the occasion:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mcintosh-on-gta-ban.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-50322" alt="mcintosh on gta ban" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/12/mcintosh-on-gta-ban.jpg" width="400" height="218"></a></p>
<p>Other saner individuals saw right through the veil of bullshit:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/12/TB-on-gta-ban.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-50323" alt="TB on gta ban" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/12/TB-on-gta-ban.jpg" width="400" height="217"></a></p>
<p>It didn’t help that GTA V was featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neTTQLbmhcA">this hilarious news report</a> as enabling virtual rape.</p>

<p><em>I am being forced to watch virtual rape!</em></p>
<p>While killing whores is an integral part of GTA experience, GTA V can be modded to allow some freaky man-on-woman, woman-on-man or dog-on-woman action. Of course, the subtleties such as facts never stopped SJWs from enacting their social justice.</p>
<p>In the video, Sam Maggs goes through the entire verbiage of SJWs: sexual assault, misogyny, and so on. All of it is meant to invoke sympathy and summon white knights to come rushing and protect this fair maiden’s tender eyes from the horrible scenes in a game which she doesn’t have to play, watch, or even think about. Yet she does. Why is that so?</p>
<h3>Hallowed be thy rape</h3>
<p>The reason why SJWs are so fixated on labeling everything as rape is because of the symbolism of power the act gives to a man. There is no such act that clearly shows the hierarchy of physical power as rape. Though actual rape is clearly a vile act, rape narratives portray women as defenseless and frail creatures, which does not align with the SJW philosophy of gender being just a societal construct and women being equal to men in every respect. UK legislation goes so far to actually define rape as <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/part/1">“penetration by penis,”</a> meaning that women cannot be held accountable for their sexual behavior in the UK. This is the endgame of SJWs.</p>
<p>Though other games have included nudity, sex, and killing of women, there isn’t anything special in the way GTA V does it. In fact, <em>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</em>, also known as “Let’s mod it until it crashes,” has a truckload of offensive mods, including one that <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/774/?">makes all children killable</a>. If you’re tired of same old character models, you can even replace them with hot virtual women and gaze-rape them as you play:</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/APWfBT8m_AM.html#t=5m30s" height="315" width="400" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Mute and feast your eyes<br>
</em></p>
<p>So, why isn’t Skyrim in the SJW crosshairs? Probably because it’s set in a fantasy rather than a quasi-real world, as GTA is. It’s much harder to cause outrage if you have to show armored barbarians having sex with each other while riding dragons and claim it’s rape. That sentence is too incredible to ever be true.</p>
<h3>The man on the edge of rape</h3>
<p>Naturally, it was just a matter of time before SJWs appeared screeching, stomping their feet, and demanding this horrible piece of entertainment none of them plays be banned, or at least removed from the shelves. Never mind that there are various content rating systems, which prohibit GTA V from being sold to minors. This video game <em>hurts feelings</em> and we must <em>do something</em>. The real reason is that men feel good playing it.</p>
<p>Men need to feel powerful and good about themselves to prosper. Boys especially need to have a daily dose of wrestling, running, and competition with friends or they become “emo”—withdrawn, insecure and emotional. Of course, the education system stops all of that nonsense and forces boys to sit still for six-plus hours each day. For the oppressive educational system, boys’ natural instincts are a danger and they need to be disempowered on a daily basis.</p>
<p>While barbarians had no other way to feel powerful than to conquer a tribe, kill all men in it, and rape all women, today there are plenty of alternatives. The more SJWs try to neuter video games, which serve as harmless outlets for men, the more they will face resistance.</p>
