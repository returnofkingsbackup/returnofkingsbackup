<p>We live in an unfortunate society where obesity is far too common. The negative consequences of being overweight are numerous but, as a man, the main two you should be worried about are:</p>
<p>1. Increased risk of a shit ton of chronic diseases</p>
<p>2. Low self-esteem and the negative affects this brings to your ability to gain respect from other men and attract women</p>
<p>…Not to mention that you’ll generally feel like crap, have lower testosterone levels, and, well, be fat.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is the lack of quality information out there. Far too many doctors and supplement companies are pushing gastric bypass surgeries and ineffective weight loss pills. The truth is that there’s a simple way to lose weight, and do so quickly. Yes, it’s going to take some discipline, but that’s all the more reason to bite the bullet and make it happen.</p>
<h3>1. Lift weights</h3>
<p>The main reason to lift weights is because you want to retain your lean mass while you’re losing weight. Losing weight without lifting weights will result in a loss of both fat and muscle tissue, and often leads to the infamous “skinny-fat” condition where you drop the pounds, but still look chubby.</p>
<p>This is because lifting weights provides your body with the necessary stimulus to hold onto your muscle—it gives your body a reason to burn fat instead of muscle (1). I suggest doing a <a href="http://www.howtobeast.com/3-reasons-full-body-routines-are-superior-to-split-routines/">full body routine</a> three times per week.</p>
<h3>2. Do some cardio</h3>
<p>Cardio will accelerate your weight loss by burning off extra calories. A 30-minute session of moderate intensity cardio can burn a few hundred calories… And it only takes a deficit of approximately 500 calories per day to shed a pound per week (2). It’s also good for your heart.</p>
<h3>3. Intermittently fast</h3>
<p>I recommend intermittent fasting because you’ll eat less food throughout the day if you only eat during eight hours of it. I don’t recommend it because I think there’s some fat-burning magic that happens when you do so. The basic way to accomplish this is to only eat between noon and 8pm. A moderate-sized breakfast and dinner, with a snack in between, is a solid plan for reducing your overall calories.</p>
<h3>4. Drink lots of water</h3>
<p>There are numerous health reasons to drink more water. It improves energy, joint health, and digestive functioning. But the reason I advise it for weight loss is that it makes your stomach feel fuller… And when you feel fuller you will eat less. Drink a large glass of water before and during each meal to take advantage of this technique.</p>

<h3>5. Drink green tea</h3>
<p>Caffeine helps you burn fat it two major ways: it curbs your diet and it can cause a slight amount of thermogenesis and fat oxidation (3). I recommend green tea over coffee because it’s easier on your stomach and it contains numerous antioxidants that coffee does not.</p>
<h3>6. Use circuit-style weight training</h3>
<p>Circuit style weight training is simply when you take a set of exercises, usually three or four, and you do them in a series back-to-back with minimal rest in between. This is beneficial for weight loss because it elevates your heart rate more than traditional one-set-at-a-time weight lifting, and thus burns more calories. Here’s a basic <a href="http://www.howtobeast.com/build-muscle-with-this-bodyweight-bulking-routine/">bodyweight-only routine</a> that can be performed in a circuit.</p>
<h3>7. Eat “healthy” foods</h3>
<p>Traditionally healthy foods are high in fiber and calorically sparse (they contain relatively few calories for their volume). This means they’ll fill you up more than “junk” foods. A few “healthy” foods include chicken, fish, vegetables, rice, potatoes, and squash.</p>
<h3>8. Eat less</h3>
<p>This is the golden rule. You must eat less in order to lose weight. You must provide your body with fewer calories than it requires to function. This forces it to harvest this energy from fat and muscle stores on your body, and results in weight loss.</p>
