<h3><b>Preface</b></h3>
<p><b></b>It seems that there has been a lot of attention in the mainstream media these past few weeks regarding—how do I put this delicately—less than credible rape allegations. Between the recent Bill Cosby allegations, the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2014/12/12/Lena-Dunham-I-Will-Not-Press-Charges-Against-My-Rapist">Lena Dunham</a> claim, the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/02/lady-gaga-raped_n_6257760.html">Lady GaGa</a> claim, and the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/12/10/Rolling-Stone-UVA-Rape-Story-Just-Took-a-Surprising-Turn">Rolling Stone UVA frat rape</a> story falling apart, the topic of rape–and false rape–has recently captured the headlines.</p>
<p>Now the issue of false rape allegations is nothing new to those of us in the manosphere, but as we all know, this topic will never be covered fairly or accurately by the liberal mainstream media. Therefore, it is our duty in the manosphere to continue to bring attention to this issue, as well as to educate other men out there about the dangerous cultural climate in which we are living. As such, I would like to offer my own insights and experience with this particular issue, based on a decade in law enforcement.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Before I begin though, I’d like to state that REAL rape is a terrible and inexcusable crime, and any traditionally masculine and honorable law-abiding man should agree with this statement. Real rapes can and do occur, and they should be investigated and punished accordingly. There is no excuse for forcible non-consensual sexual activity. With that caveat out of the way, this article is not about </span><i style="font-size: 13px;">real </i><span style="font-size: 13px;">rape or sexual assault, but rather my insight and experience with </span><i style="font-size: 13px;">false</i><span style="font-size: 13px;"> allegations.</span></p>
<h3>College</h3>
<p>I have a good friend to thank for being the first one to open my eyes to what would eventually become an epidemic over the next two decades, and for perhaps feeding me my first dose of the “red pill” (and also for introducing me to the Canadian “Space Moose” comics, which so aptly made fun of the feminist movement on college campuses back in the late 90s). Prior to a conversation with this friend back during our freshman year of college, I had never heard or even thought about the issue of false rape claims. Despite having always been politically conservative, I had still been completely “blue” to that reality until then.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">I don’t recall exactly how we got on the topic, but I distinctly remember discussing with him how easily a girl could cry rape in college, and how liberals and feminists were expanding and redefining the definitions of “rape” and “sexual assault.”  We talked about how self-reported surveys were then subliminally leading women into believing that they were victims of rape because of these expanded definitions, thereby skewing any real and meaningful statistical data.  We also discussed how rape and sexual assault, as legal definitions and criminal statutes, had essentially been hijacked and expanded by the feminist rape movement to basically include any kind of awkward, drunken, or regrettable consensual sexual encounter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">We went on to discuss various scenarios, like how a girl can go to a bar or a party, get black-out drunk, have irresponsible but consensual drunken sex, and then claim that she was “roofied” or drugged when she can’t remember anything the next morning. We discussed how today, any kind of awkward but well-meaning sexual advance, any consensual hook-up that is regretted weeks later, any consensual drunken hook-up, any irresponsible but consensual sexual encounter, and basically any other kind of benign sexual encounter that somehow makes a girl feel uncomfortable or remorseful, can now constitute rape or sexual assault in the minds of feminists and brainwashed college girls.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Hell, we even discussed how unintentionally making a girl feel uncomfortable or “creeped out” without even coming on to her can now be construed as sexual harassment or stalking in the minds of a brainwashed college girl.                     </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">After that conversation with my friend, all of the other liberal brainwashing about “rape” and “</span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_1_campus_rape.html">rape culture</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">” on campus started coming into context, and began making sense to me. All of the lectures and propaganda about the extremely dubious statistic of “</span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.breitbart.com/InstaBlog/2014/12/12/Another-phony-statistic-bites-the-dust">1 in 4</a>,<span style="font-size: 13px;">” or that traditional masculinity and college football promotes the “rape culture” on campus, or that college fraternities are nothing more than “rape factories,” as well as the fervor of the “take back the night” movement, were all put into their appropriate context, thanks to that conversation with my friend.    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Throughout my college years in the Marxist humanities department, or as I jokingly liked to say, the college of humanism and secular socialism, I was able to read between the lines and see the ulterior motives of the “rape” movement. I had always been skilled at rhetorically and intellectually picking apart and destroying progressive ideology, but now thanks to my friend, I was also intellectually aware of the feminist rape movement. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">I can distinctly recall a specific debate that I had with a female student in a sociology class, while we were discussing the topic of date rape and frat parties.  The specific premise that we were discussing was how frat parties were designed and intended solely to get girls drunk, and then take advantage of them. I stood up and played devil’s advocate to this premise, and I made the point that if girls know this is true, then why go. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"> At that point, an angry female student stood up and essentially stated “what, we’re not allowed to have fun,” while also insinuating that I was somehow “victim blaming” simply for asking why any rational girl would knowingly go to a place that had just five minutes prior been referred to as a “rape factory.”  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This anecdote illustrates the “no responsibility or consequences for actions” mindset that is being instilled in the minds of the college girls. Sure, you can go out and party recklessly all you want, and if something consensual happens while you’re intoxicated, or that you later regret, go ahead and cry foul. Have your cake and eat it too.</span></p>
<h3>Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>I made it through college and survived the Marxist brainwashing of my liberal arts major, and went on to become a cop. I work for a large department in a large metro area, but I rarely deal directly with college kids. Therefore, the following experiences do not specifically involve the college crowd, and illustrates how the false rape mindset is no longer confined to just college campuses.  I will again state that <i>real</i> rape and sexual assault is a terrible crime, and I swore an oath to ethically and dutifully investigate these matters, following proper procedures and protocols, and I take that matter seriously.</p>
<p>I will begin with a recent story. A few months ago, we responded to a large house party of kids—late teens and early 20s.  Cars were lining the streets of the neighborhood and drunk kids were stumbling around all over the place, so we had gotten a lot of complaints about it. Multiple officers arrived, and we located the house having the party.</p>
<p>As we were clearing the party—yes, being a buzzkill adult is awful I know—I located an intoxicated male and female engaged in intercourse in a—how shall I say—very less than private location. Both were so intoxicated, that they did not even notice my presence when I asked them what the hell they thought they were doing. I had to physically separate the two, pulling the young man aside while two female officers helped the woman get dressed.</p>
<p>Initially, I was simply going to charge both of them with lewd conduct for their very public display, but while I was dealing with the man, the woman stated to the two female officers that this was a non-consensual encounter, and that she did not know the man.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">That statement of course changed everything, and we began the proper procedure for that kind of investigation. We were all extremely skeptical about the matter, due to the blatantly public area in which this occurred, but nevertheless, there are still procedures to follow. The man and woman were both formally questioned, and it turned out that they did in fact know each other, were very good friends, the sex was consensual, and the woman lied because she was cheating on her boyfriend and also did not want to get in trouble with the police.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The man did not end up getting charged, but unfortunately neither did the woman, a matter which was not in my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">This incident brought up a conversation with my supervisors a few days later. We were discussing the topic of false rape claims, and all of us were racking our brains trying to think of one incident that we could recall of an adult rape claim being real. This was a combined total of roughly 50 years of law enforcement experience, both patrol and investigations, and between us we could only think of one example involving adults off the top of our heads.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Sadly, we could all recall plenty of real abuse and molestation cases involving children, but few with adults. This is again not to say that they have not happened, just that the actual crime of forcible rape in our experience was extremely rare. What did however stand out in our minds, were the many instances of claims that turned out to be blatantly false. I have also spoken with many female officers and detectives on this issue, and they also have very similar experiences. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">In my experience, I have investigated many different rape cases that ultimately turned out to be false, with some common reasons behind the initial claim.  I have seen multiple instances of a girl claiming rape after she was caught, or about to be caught, cheating on a boyfriend.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">I have seen a girl cry rape to avoid getting in trouble for being out past her curfew, which would have violated her probation.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">I have seen a girl from a religious ethnicity claim rape after getting pregnant through consensual sex, in an attempt to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock pregnancy.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">I have investigated the rape claim of a girl at a house party, which ultimately turned out to be nothing more than regrettable drunken party sex. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">And finally, I have seen multiple examples of false claims stemming from mental illness, psychosis, and delusions on the part of the woman, with various motivations behind such claims. In my experience, I can personally attest to many of the examples listed in the A Voice For Men article “</span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/false-rape-culture/13-women-who-lied-about-being-raped-and-why-they-did-it/">13 reasons women lie about rape</a><span style="font-size: 13px;">”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The overwhelming majority of these cases ended with an admission of lying on the part of the victim, after her story fell apart under standard questioning and scrutiny. Others, much like the </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2014/12/12/Lena-Dunham-I-Will-Not-Press-Charges-Against-My-Rapist">Lena Dunham</a><span style="font-size: 13px;"> claim, end with the victim refusing to admit that she is lying when confronted with scrutiny, but ultimately choosing not to pursue prosecution, and requesting to discontinue the investigation. Other cases fall apart once it is clear that the victim is psychotic, her story is not credible, and there is no probable cause to charge. A very small percentage of these cases end simply because there is no evidence or probable cause to arrest and charge. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">The good news is that in my experience, I have not seen a man wrongfully charged. This is not to say that it can’t happen—because we all know that it can—but generally police and investigators are intelligent and ethical enough to sort through the interviews, the evidence, and ultimately the PC for a charge.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Regardless of your opinion on the police, we are not intentionally looking to charge an innocent man if there is absolutely no evidence to do so. We want to find the truth. Yes, it can happen, and it is a great injustice to us all if it does, but it is not the norm or intentional. Ideally, the system is designed to allow some guilty to go free, if that adds greater protection to ensure that the innocent are not convicted.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Yet sometimes it is not up to the police, as we saw with the Duke Lacrosse case. Sometimes an overzealous DA can pursue a false case simply for his own political gain. It is for this exact reason that we must educate men on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Another unfortunate reality is that the false accusers are also rarely charged. Rarely do they suffer a consequence for their false allegations. The reasons behind this are obvious, and stem from political pressure and the politically correct notion that we must not intimidate real victims from coming forward. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"> I can say wholeheartedly that I disagree with this, but it goes way above my head. Sickeningly, you have people such as </span><a style="font-size: 13px;" href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2014/12/09/Zerlina-Maxwell-s-Plea-to-Believe-Accusers-in-Advance-of-Facts-Turns-the-Justice-System-on-Its-Head">Zerlina Maxwell</a> <span style="font-size: 13px;">advocating that the word of rape accusers should automatically be taken as truth. I’m sorry Zerlina, but we still have something called due process, evidence, and probable cause.  If she is concerned with the authorities being skeptical of rape accusers, there is no one to blame but the false accusers crying wolf. They are the ones who have forced many of us, not only law enforcement, to question the validity of such accusations.</span></p>
<h3>Putting It All together</h3>
<p>With the feminist false rape narrative once primarily attributed to college campuses now spilling out into the general public, what is the intended purpose behind this culture script? Perhaps the main motivation is to continue to promote the false narrative of an epidemic of women being victimized.</p>
<p>By continuing to perpetuate that women are helpless victims, feminists and various other social justice warrior activists can continue to request money, government funding, and federal grants for their various centers, organizations, and non-profits. Another key reason is that feminists can continue to redefine—i.e. kill—traditional masculinity, by deeming it barbaric, dangerous, and threatening towards women, in that it produces the “rape culture.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">Ironically, these are some of the same feminists and progressives that are teaching and encouraging young women in college to go out and explore their sexuality without inhibition, and to be promiscuous. They are teaching lectures and seminars on how to have better sex, while passing out condoms and sex toys to students, all the while continuing to expand and redefine the act of rape if this exploration ever becomes uncomfortable or regrettable.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">They are encouraging young girls to “hook up,”, while referring to men’s promiscuity as “rape culture.” Now I am in no way implying that anyone ever deserves to be raped, nor am I implying that non-consent is ever justified because “she was asking for it,” but I am simply pointing out the blatant double standard that feminists are promoting.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;">We are ultimately creating n environment where women no longer have to feel responsible for their actions. Instead, they are being encouraged to go out and have irresponsible casual sex, but also to cry rape if they regret it later. Take it from me—I’ve seen it firsthand.</span></p>
