<p>As I get older and more experienced in game, I realize that I’ve been developing a strong character like you would writing a script for a movie. Nowadays, because there’s such a lack of character in pop culture, guys might not really understand what “character” means.</p>
<p>I remember one of the screen writing classes I took in film school that taught me the difference between a dynamic character and a static one. I must say that I never forgot what I learned in that course, and still use it to measure my character development in game.</p>
<h4>1. Static Character</h4>
<p>Static characters are the opposite of dynamic; static characters do not change. The personality of that character when he is introduced is the same personality when the story comes to a close. And all his actions in between stay true to that personality.</p>
<p>While our story is our “journey in game,” most of us are static characters even when we seek to transform our personalities by learning how to pick up and seduce women. We become frustrated when we try to mask who we are by cheesy pickup lines and dead-end routines. Truth is, fake it ’til you make it is necessary for most of us, much like a hero in a movie must first wake up from his delusion and hear the call to duty.</p>
<p>If a character in a movie is to become a successful hero, then he needs a wizard or “guru” to show him the way, which boils down to convincing him that he has it within himself already to make a difference. If the character is a good person to begin with, then there’s no reason to change.</p>
<p>The only thing that can make his character more interesting is to make him face very difficult challenges that will test his ability to overcome personal weakness. In pick-up, we advance our inner game when we challenge ourselves with different interactions that test our emotional weaknesses.</p>
<h4>2. Dynamic Character</h4>
<p>A dynamic character is a literary or dramatic character who undergoes an important inner change, such as a change in personality or attitude: Ebeneezer Scrooge is a dynamic character.</p>
<p>If our game lacks empathy or genuine interest in a girl, then it’s going to be very difficult to seduce her. For example, how are you going to overcome different obstacles or objections if you can’t offer a “false time constraint” so she feels free to leave anytime she feels uncomfortable? Every good seducer has either changed to become or already is an “easy-going” person. Therefore, one needs to determine if they are going to be a static character or a dynamic one in their journey in game.</p>
<h4>3. Nice Guys vs. Bad Boy Characters</h4>
<p>Believe it or not, both the “nice guy” and the “bad boy” are static characters. In fact, a woman who is attracted to you will test your character to see if you can handle her emotional state. The nicer the guy, the more important it is for his yes to mean yes and his no to mean no. The more a guy has a bad attitude, the more thoughtful and flexible he must be towards a girl.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>It’s not congruent in your character to be a nice guy and then attempt to be “dynamic” by becoming a “bad boy.”  Movies with these types of characters are generally comedies filled with lots of laughter and embarrassing humor.</p>
<p>Women hunger for drama like men crave serenity, so give it to them by simply being congruent. Don’t worry about creating the drama, because she’ll create most of it for you while on her emotional roller coaster. One minute she’ll be excited to see you and the next she won’t be able to stand to be near you. Your static characteristic and that immovable look on your face will provide plenty of drama for her emotions to feed off of.</p>
<p>A good “chick flick” that most women drool over is when the masculine character is super congruent while the feminine one goes on this epic emotional rampage. At the end of the movie, the girl always falls in love with a guy who can handle her emotionally and the male figure realizes again how easier it was to stay true to himself.</p>
<h4>4. How To Develop Character</h4>
<p>A well-known professional screenwriter John Truby says that Hollywood discovered what makes an audience care for a particular character in a movie, and that is not necessarily a specific goal to be achieved. Instead, it’s a particular weakness the main character has to overcome while on his journey to success.</p>
<p>This is how the method should be when developing our character in game; to overcome some personal weakness or flaw in our persona. In fact, this is the only way we as an audience to ourselves, will stay engaged and interested in game.</p>
<p>One of the greatest movies of all time was <em>The Wizard of Oz,</em> because each of the main four characters had some sort of weakness to overcome while on their journey to the Emerald City. At the end of the yellow brick road, the wizard turned out to be not that powerful. However, the Lion found courage, the Tin Man finally had a heart, the Scarecrow did have a brain, and Dorothy discovered it’s better to dream big and always risk adventure.</p>
<p>What our journey in game leads to is the realization that so-called “top dating gurus” and products in the pick-up community were never enough to improve your game overnight. We find out how much of an adventure it is to learn game for real so that a man’s life is never boring and always full of character.</p>
