<p>In the past couple months, there’s been a sudden explosion in articles decrying anti-social behaviors that men apparently are guilty of. The most well-known is “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/nyregion/MTA-targets-manspreading-on-new-york-city-subways.html">manspreading</a>,” the idea that men spread their legs too wide on subways, encroaching on womens’ rightful space. Indeed, <a href="http://takimag.com/article/a_plague_of_ingrates_matt_forney">in part due to pressure from hypersensitive millennial women</a>, the MTA has launched a campaign against “manspreading” on the New York City Subway.</p>
<p>“Manspreading” is far from the only “man” behavior that women in the media whine about. There’s also “<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11335383/Man-slamming-another-reason-to-slam-men.html">manslamming</a>,” the idea that men don’t move out of the way of women on the sidewalk fast enough, as well as “<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/us-money-blog/2015/jan/15/women-gender-survey-research-success">manterupting</a>,” the claim that women are frequently shouted down by men at business meetings and the like. “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/11/a-cultural-history-of-mansplaining/264380/">Mansplaining</a>,” a term feminists use to describe men who infringe on their feelings of narcissistic superiority, has been around for a few years now.</p>
<p>It’s easy to dismiss these crybaby articles as first world problems; indeed, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/8167/why-modern-feminism-is-white-womans-privilege">it’s a testament to how good Western women have it</a> that the <em>only</em> thing they have left to complain about is men bumping into them on the street. But the agita over “manspreading” and its sister afflictions speaks to a deeper pathology in modern women. American girls have a deep-seated <em>fear</em> of masculinity and men, created by cultural Marxism, and this fear is the central reason why male-female relations are so dysfunctional.</p>

<h3>How Men And Women Became Enemies</h3>
<p>The adversarial relationship between men and women is one of those aspects of American culture that you don’t really notice until you’ve spent some time outside the country. In my case, it took three months in the Philippines to realize that American sexual mores aren’t just actively harmful, they have almost <em>nothing</em> in common with the way the rest of the world does things.</p>
<p>Unique among world cultures (except maybe the Middle East, which has its own problems), American and other western societies are extremely age- and sex-segregated. Boys and girls grow up in same-sex cocoons, consuming sex-specific entertainment and having no real interaction with the opposite sex until their teen and college years. This shift can be seen in pop music: in contrast to the aggressive male musicians of the past such as Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones, millennial girls prefer either grrl-power acts like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé or unthreatening boy bands like One Direction.</p>
<p>In the specific case of girls, they’re also fed a constant diet of anti-male propaganda. They’re told that <a href="http://mattforney.com/2013/09/16/the-case-against-female-self-esteem/">they’re special just for having a vagina</a> <em>and</em> victimized by virtue of having that vagina. The lies about the pay gap, the prevalence of rape and other debunked feminist bugaboos steadily condition girls to resent and fear men. At the same time, mass media’s constant depictions of men as stupid and evil (in commercials and TV shows etc.) leave girls without any positive male role models.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that while girls may fear men, they still want to sleep with them and have to interact with them on a daily basis. This lingering unease in American women—being attracted to that which they’ve been conditioned to fear—is the genesis of America’s screwed up sexual landscape. <em>Roosh V Forum</em> member AnonymousBosch has correctly identified millennial girls as having a “<a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-36406-post-735368.html#pid735368">dismissive-avoidant</a>” attachment style, characterized by narcissism and an inability to form relationships with others.</p>

<h3>Fear Of A Male Planet</h3>
<p>Virtually every interaction you will have with a millennial girl will be defined by her fear of your masculinity. “Rape culture,” for example, is one of the most destructive effects of millennial social retardation. Because young women are not properly socialized on how to deal with men, they have no idea how to navigate sexual encounters beyond their animal urges. When women sleep with men and regret it afterwards, they rationalize it as “rape” because cultural Marxist and SJW ideology has trained her to assume the worst from men.</p>
<p>For example, Columbia student <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/43097/female-university-student-carries-around-mattress-she-was-raped-on">Emma Sulkowicz</a>, who is carrying her mattress around campus in protest at her “rapist” not being expelled, was clearly not taught how to interact with men. <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/man-called-a-rapist-by-sen.-kirsten-gillibrand-probably-couldnt-win-a-libel-suit/article/2559161?custom_click=rss">Her relationship with Paul Nungesser was very clearly consensual</a> and her only problem was that she did things with him that she later regretted.</p>
<p>In decades past, Sulkowicz would have been told to suck it up and move on. But because modern society socializes women to fear men and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/52882/why-does-the-left-support-radical-muslims">indulge their feelings</a> at every opportunity, she thinks that making a show about being “raped” is the best way to deal with her heartbreak.</p>
<p>“Manspreading,” “manslamming” and the like are just the latest manifestations of this pathology. Young women are so retarded and entitled that they believe they have a <em>right</em> to not come into contact with any man that they don’t want to… even in a crowded, public environment like the subway. It’s like they’re a bunch of little girls afraid that touching boys will give them the equivalent of cooties.</p>
<p>The Personal Space Box is the perfect visual representation of how millennial women think. Narcissism and poor socialization combine to create a monster. She exists in her own reality, oblivious to the humanity of those around her, and woe befall any fool who punctures her bubble of delusion.</p>

<h3>Gender War Is A Racket</h3>
<p>Living in the Philippines was part of what made me realize all this. While Filipino women more or less have the same rights as American women, and arguably have <em>more</em> freedom—the Philippines has had <em>two</em> female presidents while the U.S. has had <em>zero</em>—<a href="http://mattforney.com/2014/09/15/how-to-protect-a-nation-against-feminism-marxism-and-sluttiness/">the adversarial gender politics of the West are completely alien there</a>. This is because of the strength of the Filipino family.</p>
<p>Unlike in the U.S., where women are conditioned to think of themselves as a <em>class</em> in the Marxist sense, in opposition to men, Filipinos view themselves as part of an integrated whole. Filipinos are brought up in close contact with their extended family, meaning that by the time they become adults, they have a strong grasp of how those of other ages and/or the opposite sex behave. Filipinas don’t fear masculine men the way American girls do because they <em>know</em> them and how they think.</p>
<p>Cultural Marxism works to undermine the family unit because the family is the most <em>effective</em> way to contain leftism. By encouraging men and women to oppose each other, by breaking up families, <a href="http://mattforney.com/2014/01/06/the-inevitability-of-female-submission/">the government-corporate complex can transform a nation into obedient consumerist drones</a>. America is a giant shopping mall filled with 300 million atomized, rootless individuals, buying cheap crap and working mind-numbing jobs in lieu of creating anything <em>real.</em></p>
<p>“Manspreading” is just the latest salvo in the war between men and women, a war that benefits everyone <em>but</em> the people fighting it. And as the constant stream of man-shaming articles from the media shows, women are all too eager to take up arms for their corporate masters against the men their instincts tell them to love.</p>
