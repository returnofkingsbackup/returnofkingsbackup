<h3>Point Of No Return</h3>
<p>Taking the red pill is the single most important thing a man living in the Anglo world can do for himself. Once he completely unplugs from the matrix he works on building a strong mind and body, getting his financial house in order, de-pedestalizing women, improving himself in ways that increase his value, and of course attracting the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the red pill doesn’t always go down so easily. Some men fight it, some deny it, and some even try to spit it back out hoping to go back to the land of blissful ignorance. But once he’s made aware of the truth, he’s changed forever whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p><a href="http://iframewidth=420height=315src=//www.youtube.com/embed/VNQ4H0XWA_wframeborder=0allowfullscreen/iframe"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/VNQ4H0XWA_w" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></a></p>
<p>Once the male mind is exposed to red pill knowledge it is incapable of flushing it out because the truth has always been staring him right in the face. We all know that the red pill provides a sustainable quality of life for men over a prolonged period of time. But it begins by simply making a man aware of what he already suspects. Once that dormant part of his brain is awakened by the ugly truth, there is no turning back. Some things cannot be unlearned and the truth about what is really going on around him is one of them.</p>
<h3>The Progression</h3>
<p>Red pill awareness, like most radical changes in life, has its stages:</p>
<p><em><strong>Shock</strong></em>: This is what happens when you see material that flies in the face of the feminist agenda and that it is actually allowed on the internet.</p>
<p><strong><em>Anger</em></strong>: This stage happens almost immediately after the shock wears off. You become angry with women, your parents, the world, even your dog because you realized you’ve been sold a bad bill of goods by everyone around you your whole life. You shake your head in disgust as you remember past relationships and how plainly obvious it was they were cheating on you.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit;"><em><strong>Euphoria</strong></em>: Knowing there are other like-minded men out there who understand what you’ve gone through as a blue-piller and are able to articulate how to overcome your faulty programming and dominate life gives you a sense of elation like you’ve never felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit;"><em><strong>Gluttony</strong></em>: This phase completely engulfs you as you spend countless hours consuming so much manosphere-related material your brain hurts and your eyes burn, but you continue stuffing your face late into the night…</span></p>
<div style="width: 606px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img src="http://matt-sandra.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Eye-strain.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="447"><p class="wp-caption-text">…just like this guy</p>
</div>
<p><em><strong>Addiction</strong></em>: You can’t go more than a few hours without reading ROK, <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/" target="_blank">Roosh V Forum</a>, <a href="http://illimitablemen.com/" target="_blank">Illimitable Men</a>, <a href="http://therationalmale.com/" target="_blank">The Rational Male</a>, or any of the other 78 sites you have bookmarked. You faithfully refresh those pages every hour on the hour looking for that next hit. You have to have your fix or you’ll get twitchy.</p>
<p><em><strong>Application</strong></em>: This is where you start honing your new found super powers. You’re <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/author/dcdlm" target="_blank">hitting the gym</a>, eating clean, and taking up productive hobbies. Your confidence is growing by the day so you’ve taken to talking to girls whenever and however you damn well please and they’re lapping up your game like a stray cat to warm milk.</p>
<p>You’re not watching as much TV or wasting as much time on social media because you just don’t have the time anymore. You’d rather be perfecting your squat form, engaging in lively debates on RVF about shit test theories, or working on starting your own business so you can get the fuck out of that <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/32541/where-beta-males-are-polished-to-perfection" target="_blank">miserable cubicle you spend 40 hours a week in.</a></p>
<p><strong><em>Congruency</em></strong>: The red pill is no longer an idea, it’s who you are. You’re in better shape, you’ve done a little traveling (and plan to do more), and your financial outlook has improved. You’re banging 6s and 7s pretty consistently, which isn’t where you want to be but you’re headed in the right direction. It’s only a matter of time before you’re in the best shape of your life, have the money to live the way you want to, and knee-deep in high quality ass on the regular.</p>
<p>Thanks to your red pill renaissance life is pretty damn good and it’s only going to get better from here on out.</p>
<p>As awesome as your life is right now it’s important to understand that there will be side effects. Your crimson capsule crusade will not be all peaches and cream, and the longer you live this lifestyle the more obvious this will become. But learning what these side effects are and what to expect will help you to adjust your mentality accordingly. This way, you can minimize these effects and even turn them into an advantage.</p>
<h3>1. Your Social Circle Will Shrink</h3>
<p>Once you’ve digested the red pill it will be difficult to hide your newfound persona. You’ll try, but eventually the floodgates will open, leaving your friends and family wondering what the hell has gotten into you. When they ask how and why you’re kicking life’s ass they’re not going to like to answers. They’ll certainly respect you and maybe even admire you, but red pill truth scares the shit out of people and makes them uncomfortable. This can ultimately lead to them to avoiding you altogether.</p>
<div style="width: 333px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img src="http://www.nonsda.org/egw/images/awe.jpg" alt="" width="323" height="344"><p class="wp-caption-text">He said WHAT?!?</p>
</div>
<p>I’ve lost many friends over the years because I don’t bow down to the almighty vagina and I have zero issue with expressing as much. I used to be of the mind that being open about the red pill was a bad idea, so I kept quiet when I felt the need to offer an opinion. But these days there is no filter. I say what needs to be said and let the chips fall where they may.</p>
<p>Crimson capsule congruency simply will not allow a man to be a beta—it can’t be done. When a girl demands he buy her a drink, he blurts out “right after you buy me one” without even thinking. The same principle applies with your daily interaction with your family and friends.</p>
<p>For example, when your buddy tells you he’s in love with a woman ten years his senior with two children you’re probably going to laugh out loud. Yes, this will probably piss him off and he may not want to hang with you anymore, but that’s the way it is when you live the red pill life.</p>
<p>So be ready for a reduction in your social and family circle. It may suck at first but after a while you’ll find that being around like-minded men and feminine, attractive women who show deference in your presence significantly increases your quality of life. You may miss the people you’ve spent time with in the past but this is a small price to pay for a better life.</p>
<h3>2. You Won’t Like Women As Much</h3>
<p>One of the first things that happens when you take off your blue pill glasses is that you quickly learn that girls are made of everything <em>but</em> sugar, spice, and everything nice. You’ll understand what makes them tick and more importantly, what their true nature is. This leads to liking them a little less than you did before your eyes were opened.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>This isn’t to say that you’ll despise them. Far from it. All of us here love the way women smell, the way they walk, the way they feel (inside and out) and the comfort and rejuvenating properties of genuine femininity. Even though they’re weird and wonderful, fantastic and fucked up all at the same time, their company does have unique ways of elevating your mood, however fleeting it may be.</p>
<p>But now that you’ve been let behind the curtain and can accurately predict most any woman’s behavior, they’re not quite as impressive or mysterious as they used to be. Plus, having intimate knowledge of some of their most nefarious traits such as their double-edged sexual strategy (alpha fucks – beta bucks) or how slutty they really are makes it impossible to look at them through the same lens.</p>
<div style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="https://iaincarstairs.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/wizard-of-oz.gif" alt="" width="600" height="486"><p class="wp-caption-text">That about sums it up</p>
</div>
<p>It’s common knowledge that once a magician reveals his trick, he becomes less impressive. The prestige no longer has the same effect because you know how he accomplished it. It’s the same with women. The red pill has so thoroughly and accurately dissected the inner workings of the second sex that they’re just not that awe-inspiring anymore.</p>
<p>I remember when I used to think girls were God’s greatest gift. The red pill has destroyed that for me. Even though I’m much better off this way I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss the perceived aura that radiated from them. Ignorance, indeed, is bliss. Sometimes knowing how the sausage is made isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.</p>
<h3>3. The Thrill Is Gone</h3>
<p>I’ll never forget the first time I approached a girl with red pill game. She was a sexy little red-headed number with a pert ass and great legs. She was in the produce aisle trying to pick out the perfect grape fruit. When she reached for one I noticed a tattoo on her inner wrist. “So much for an LTR,” I playfully joked with myself. I obviously wasn’t thinking about our honeymoon but she was as good a girl as any to christen my post red pill game with.</p>
<p>I’d practiced, drilled, and rehearsed all the PUA techniques, body language and positioning. I was ready. I took a deep breath, walked up, looked her right in the eye with something of a cross between a smile and a smirk on my face and said “Hi, I’m Donovan.”</p>
<p>She bit.</p>
<p>She pleasantly told me her name and politely shook my hand. We ended up having about a 10 minute conversation about juicing (I’d recently purchased one and steered the conversation in that direction). I passed a relatively easy shit test, made a joke about green juice, and got the digits.</p>
<p>“Holy fuck!” I thought doing my best to compose myself as she put her number into my phone. “This shit actually works!”</p>
<p>The girl ended up flaking but I didn’t care. I was hooked. Hooked on the dopamine rush that came with interacting with a female, escalating, and seeing it work. I became an approach machine and though I had my share of failures (that’s the game, gents) the rest, as they say, is history.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened on the way to the fabled playa status: The better I got at gaming females, the less of a thrill it became. Make no mistake…sticking your dick in a new vag will always be exciting. I’d even go as far as to say that most of the time, the best sex you have with a girl is the first time.</p>
<p>However, the path that leads past the typical western woman’s pearly gates is anything but a road less traveled. Yes, every girl is different in their own way and that requires minor tweaks in your game to gain entry to her sugar walls but by and large, the same technique works for most American girls: Bold approach, charm, pass shit-test, number close, text game, meet up, charm, neg, charm, neg (push-pull), escalate, swat away LMR (the final shit-test), close the deal.</p>
<p>Gone are the days where feminine women and masculine men engaged in the seductive mating dances of yesteryear. Playful flirting, laughing together, asking each other honest questions and being genuinely interested in the answer, and the gentle, coquettish game of tug of war, used to be the order of the day. With lively, innocent dancing and maybe an adult beverage or two to mildly lubricate the interaction, courting used to be a ritual immensely enjoyed by both men and women alike. The thrill of the chase was rich and palpable and it <em>never</em> got old.</p>
<div style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="http://images.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Grease-grease-the-movie-512419_400_300.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300"><p class="wp-caption-text">This brand of courtship is long gone</p>
</div>
<p>Today, things could not be more different. First dates for men are something akin to job interviews, and the only flirting involved is when she gives him slut face, grabs his package, or asks him what he does for a living to gauge his potential to fund her useless life. This is followed by him telling her that her ass looks huge in those jeans or that she would make a great candidate for his harem which gets her all hot and bothered.</p>
<p>The dancing involved is simulated clothed sex and with the hard liquor flowing like a river, this alcohol fueled, pseudo-pornographic scene gets more lewd by the second…and that’s if we’re lucky. Much of the time it doesn’t even get this far because his fear of women and her bratty behavior stops the party before it begins.</p>
<p>Learning to thrive in today’s sexual landscape as a man is a process and once he can achieve success (sex) on a regular basis his morale improves—especially if he previously failed with women. But after a few years, putting on a <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/men-are-nothing-more-than-clowns-to-the-modern-woman" target="_blank">clown suit</a> to appease the increasing attention deficit disorder of today’s woman gets old. Eventually the monotony and predictability of game all but kills the thrill of the chase.</p>
<h3>Remedies</h3>
<p>There’s no question that it’s a real bummer when your parents express their disappointment and wonder aloud “where they went wrong” with you when you tell them you have no interest in having children or starting a family. I’m also not going to sit here and pretend that I don’t miss some of the my old crew either.</p>
<p>It’s equally crappy when you finally accept that girls aren’t the shiny objects you thought they were. The worst, of course, is when the adrenaline rush that comes with approaching girls diminishes until it’s almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Fortunately the red pill offers natural remedies to these side effects. Friends and family that shun you for not going with the feminist flow will matter less as you continue in your development. A true alpha doesn’t need acceptance or validation from anyone but himself.</p>
<p>As far as women go, the more you learn about them the more you realize how unnecessary they are to your overall happiness aside from the few minutes of sex you’re able to game out of them. By the time you master the Venusian Arts here in the states, your boredom will let you know that you’re ready to take the party abroad and sample higher quality fare. The new challenge of becoming an international playboy will rejuvenate your fervor to pursue the girls of a different breed.</p>

</div>
<p>These side effects may not sound like much, but if you don’t know how to side step them or make them an advantage they could blindside you and potentially derail your development. Take heed of these speed bumps and take the time to fortify your mindset and lifestyle accordingly.</p>
