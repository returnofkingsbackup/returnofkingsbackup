<p><em>The following article has been sponsored by <a href="http://book.fit-juice.com/danger-and-play-special/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Juice Power by Mike Cernovich</a></em></p>
<p>It’s difficult to stay healthy in the modern world. With xenoestrogens pumped into our body via our drinking water and plastic containers, forced sedentary lifestyles due to office jobs, and mass-produced food engineered to make us fat and depressed, sometimes it seems that there are no simple solutions to help us live a happy and healthy life.</p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>Can the solution to many modern health problems really be as simple as grinding up vegetables and drinking them? In his new book <em><a href="http://book.fit-juice.com/danger-and-play-special/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Juice Power</a></em>, Mike Cernovich makes an airtight case that the practice of juicing fruits and vegetables confers serious health benefits in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Mike has compiled information from his Fit Juice blog and previously unreleased material into three well-edited, visually appealing, and easy to understand ebooks. Here are five things from the books that you may not have known about the manosphere’s fastest growing staple habit:</p>
<h3>1. It might be the fastest known way to supply your body with nutrients</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-55694" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice-300x188.jpg" alt="vegetable-juice" width="345" height="216" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice-300x188.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice-1200x750.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice-837x523.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice-667x417.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice-262x164.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/vegetable-juice-574x359.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px"></a></p>
<p>Nutrient consumption and absorption is a problem in today’s society, where two thirds of the population are overweight or obese due to the consumption of nutrition-bereft Frankenfoods. Juicing may be the fastest way to remedy this deficiency. As Mike writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Jay Kordich noted, “Your body is a juicer.” That is, your intestines extract the minerals and phytonutrients from the fruits and vegetables. Juicing gives your body a break by doing the work for it.</p>
<p>Since the juicer has done all of the masticating for you, the plant’s nutrients are immediately absorbed into your intestinal walls.</p>
<p>The most efficient way to extract the nutrients from your food:</p>
<p>1. Juicing 2. Blending 3. Eating.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>2. You can save lots of money by getting a better juicer</h3>
<p>Unlike other products where you pay a premium simply for a brand name, spending more on a juicer actually produces better and more juice, an investment in both monetary and health terms. In the long run, your marginally higher initial investment will pay off handsomely:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know for a fact that a masticating juicer will give you 50-100% more juice from your leafy greens. Whereas a centrifugal juicer may only yield 2-4 ounces of juice from a large bunch of kale, a masticating juicer may yield up to 4-8 ounces.</p>
<p>Bar none the best masticating juicers are the Omega brand juicers. Omega juicers come with 10-15 year warranties. They are high quality and high yield.</p>
<p>The top contenders for best masticating juicers are the Omega J8006 and Omega VRT 350.</p>
<p>These are commercial grade juicers that are made to last. Omega stands behind their juicers. If you buy a new juicer from Amazon, you will receive a 10-year warranty. (Breville only offers a 1-year warranty.)</p>
<p>Buying an Omega juicer is a lot like buying in bulk. You pay more money up front to save money by not having to make several smaller purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>3. The nutrient explosion from juicing actually helps your body rid itself of toxins</h3>

</div>
<p>Mike shows us the science behind juicing’s myriad positive effects on the body and explains it in layman’s terms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The liver is the organ responsible for detoxing your body. Although there are many “cleanses” marketed as liver detox systems, the truth is that your liver needs the vitamins and phytonutrients present in whole foods in order to cleanse and detox itself. The liver also needs amino acids in order to filter out those toxins.</p>
<p>The most important foods for a liver detox are sulfur-rich foods (allium vegetables like onion and garlic and cruciferous vegetables like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and bok choy)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>4. Juicing can raise your testosterone</h3>
<p>In the supplemental ebook <em>Juicing For Men</em>, Mike writes extensively about how juicing can boost your testosterone and fight estrogenic environmental factors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Little did I know that pomegranates raise testosterone while also improving penile blood flow. Like beet juice, pomegranate juice is nature’s Viagra. Viagra’s little blue pill has become a byword for giving your sex drive a boost.</p>
<p>But scientists have found a daily glass of pomegranate juice could also liven up your libido.</p>
<p>Men and women who drank a glass a day for a fortnight were found to have increased levels of the sex hormone testosterone.</p>
<p>A study on 58 volunteers aged between 21 and 64 found “significantly increased” testosterone levels in both sexes at the end of the two week experiment.</p>
<p>Pomegranate juice increased sex drive in both men and women. It also improves their moods and overall mental health.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>5. Juicing will give you an athletic edge<strong><strong> </strong></strong>

<p>Professional athletes spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on training regimens, specialized drugs, and peak nutritional practices to compete at the highest level. If you’re an endurance athlete, combat sports enthusiast, or just a guy trying to hit some PRs in the gym, juicing can provide a serious boost to your training. Mike shows evidence that an invaluable asset might be sitting on the shelf at your corner bodega:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beet juice is so great for exercise that elite cyclists around the world have been using it for years to make them more powerful and to improve their endurance.</p>
<p>The nitrates in beet juice increase vasodilation, that is, beet juice causes your blood vessels and capillaries to expand. Wider blood vessels and capillaries mean you have more blood flowing into the muscle.</p>
<p>More blood flowing into the muscle means you have better “pumps” in the gym as well as increased performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideal for both beginners and veteran juicers, the books take you through the mindset behind improving your health, how to buy your first juicer, and recipes to help you start possibly the single best habit you can add to your daily routine. It also presents extensive evidence that juicing can fight depression, prevent diabetes, make you more attractive, and ward off sickness.</p>
<p>Mike also released two supplements available to the main <em><a href="http://book.fit-juice.com/danger-and-play-special/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Juice Power</a></em> book, and he recently reduced the price to $14.99 for all three volumes including the excellent <em>Juicing For Men and Juicing For Athletes</em>. With the tips included on how to get the most economical juicer and optimize the cost-effectiveness of your juice recipes, the books will pay for themselves after just a few cycles.</p>
