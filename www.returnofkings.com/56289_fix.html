<p>We need to have a little talk, you and I.</p>
<p>No one is perfect. No one is exempt from lapses in discipline, or failures to maintain proper bearing. The important question is whether we will correct our conduct, and get back on the right track.</p>
<p>We need to talk about this, because it’s an important subject. In my day-to-day life, I often see men who act like wusses, wimps, or pussies. Some of these people are easy to identify. Some are not. None of us is exempt, from time to time, from occasionally veering our ship into these pussified shoals. Inside every successful man, no matter how great, is an inner wuss that must be checked and restrained.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-56292" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss2-300x244.jpg" alt="wuss2" width="300" height="244" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss2-300x244.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss2-262x213.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss2.jpg 468w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>What is the “inner wuss”? It’s that little voice inside your head that tells you to do wuss-like things. It’s that voice telling you to write a malicious, dickish comment on a blog that you know is cowardly bullshit. It’s that little voice telling you to go easy on yourself, to sit back and coast, to dodge responsibility for your life, to snipe at people more successful than you, and to take a “wait and see” approach to everything.</p>
<p>It’s that voice crying out for other people to comfort you in your wussified behavior. You know what this voice sounds like. Because you hear it every day. We all do, to some extent.</p>
<p>You can’t achieve the goals you want in life without keeping your inner wuss safely locked away in the basement: and I mean chained and bound. You can’t empower him. You can’t listen to him. He doesn’t want to help you. He wants to hurt you.</p>
<p>But how do we know when we’re acting like fucking wusses? How do we know when our inner slimebag is trying to ooze out? Here are some guidelines. I want you to read this list carefully.</p>
<h3>1. You make things easier on yourself</h3>
<p>Wusses like to take it easy. They don’t want to be challenged. They would rather take the short cuts in life, to copy someone else’s homework, to skate out of their responsibilities. Wusses like to come up with elaborate rationalizations as to why they can’t stop being wusses.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss1.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-56293" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss1-300x169.png" alt="wuss1" width="300" height="169" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss1-300x169.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss1-262x148.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss1.png 550w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>On a long enough timeline, the wuss in you can dominate all of your dealings in life. And when that happens, you’re just like all those other worthless sacks of shit in America, sitting in front of the television, griping about imaginary bugbears. The problem is not what’s on the television. The problem is you: you’re a wuss.</p>
<h3>2. You always have excuses</h3>
<p>Wusses love excuses. They have them for every occasion. Just ask any fucking wuss you know, and he’ll rattle off a whole laundry list of why he can’t go to the gym, why he can’t get laid, why he can’t travel, why he can’t get his business off the ground, why he can’t learn his favorite foreign language. And you know what? It doesn’t add up to dry shit. Because the problem is him: he’s a fucking wuss. So you need to stop giving excuses.</p>
<h3>3. You’re arrogant and opinionated</h3>
<p>This may sound counter-intuitive. Why would a fucking pussy be arrogant and opinionated? But the answer makes sense, when you think about it. The wuss is, deep down, afraid of being exposed. So he sublimates his fear, and projects it outward. He becomes an expert on everything. <em>Just ask him!</em> He’ll tell you.</p>
<p>He knows everything about everything; and more importantly, he knows why everyone else is doing things the wrong way. Acting arrogant and opinionated is the wuss’s way of channeling his insecurity outward.</p>

<h3>4. You’re hypercritical of others</h3>
<p>Not only is the wuss an arrogant prick, but he loves to tear down other people. Again, the driving impulse here is fear and insecurity. If the wuss is successful at taking down other people, he can feel better about himself.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<h3>5. You refuse helpful leadership</h3>
<p>A real man is not afraid of being led by a real leader. But the wuss instinctively recoils from vigorous leadership. He doesn’t want to be told what to do. He doesn’t want to be corrected. He doesn’t want to be given guidance. He’s happy festering in his own shit.</p>
<h3>6. You’re slovenly and disorganized</h3>
<p>Yeah, yeah, I know. You think that your messy room, unkempt appearance, and fucked-up clothing are signs of how much of a cool rebel you are. You think your lack of preoccupation with worldly concerns makes you a wise person. Wrong: this is how wusses think.</p>
<p>No healthy thinking or acting can take place in the midst of slovenliness. It takes work and effort to look good and live in a good environment. Get your head out of rectal defilade and clean your act up. Lack of attention to personal grooming and hygiene shows only that you are one thing: a fucking wuss.</p>

<h3>7. You dislike criticism and self-reflection</h3>
<p>Wusses hate to look into the mirror. They hate to reflect on their wussiness. Wusses are hypersensitive about almost everything related to themselves. And most of all, they hate to hear other people point out deficiencies in their lifestyle.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at themselves, wusses love to project their neuroses and problems out on others. They externalize. They rationalize. But in the end, it never satisfies them completely. Because deep down, they know what the real problem is. The real problem is them: they’re fucking wusses.</p>
<h3>8. You avoid successful people or good things</h3>
<p>Wusses hate good quality. They hate great things. Wusses hate winners. Wusses hate reminders of how pathetic they are. Wusses will perform elaborate somersaults to avoid coming into contact with healthy, strong characters. They hang around other pussies and wusses, so that they can feel better about themselves. If you look around you and see a bunch of wusses, then guess what? You’re one too.</p>
<h3>9. You take a “wait and see” approach too much</h3>
<p>Lack of decision is not a good trait. Wusses like to sit back, see how things develop, and hope that problems sort themselves out. They are not problem-solvers. They are problem-dodgers. Yes, sometimes in life things can be solved by patient waiting. But that is not the game plan of the wuss. His inaction is not based on a calculated, rational plan. His inaction is based on the fact that he is a fucking wuss.</p>
<p>If you want to solve problems, you need to solve them. Not cogitate about them. Not start a thread on a forum about them, so you can wrap yourself in a fucking comfort blanket, and have everyone molly-coddle your insecurities. You need to take action. Like, right fucking now.</p>
<p>Don’t tell me it’s hard. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. The problem is one of willpower.</p>
<h4><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss4.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-56296" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/wuss4.jpg" alt="wuss4" width="367" height="276"></a></h4>
<h3>10. You’re a malingerer</h3>
<p>Wusses always seem to have some physical deficiency. They have lower back problems. They have upper back problems. They have fallen arches. They have fallen eyebrows. They have hangnails, carpal tunnel, arachnophobia, dorkophobia, sensitive skin, lactose intolerance, work intolerance, allergies, and a hundred other bloody things.</p>
<p>And amazingly, all of these physical problems flare up at convenient times when work needs to be done. Most people in the world have some physical issue or another. But they deal with it. Quietly. The real problem is you: you’re a wuss.</p>
<h3>11. You encounter the first obstacle, and then give up</h3>
<p>Wusses can’t carry complex tasks through to conclusion. When they are told to do something, or when they undertake something, they quit at the very first sign of difficulty. They take off their pack, sit on the side of the road, and give up.</p>
<p>No project in life that is worth doing is going to be easy. Nothing is going to be smooth sailing. There will be obstacles, roadblocks, and barriers placed in front of you at every step of the way. No one out there wants you to succeed. You need to push though all these obstacles.</p>
<p>If something doesn’t work, try something else. If you find an obstacle, go around it. If you encounter a barrier, smash through it. Need a battering ram? Use your head if you have to. There is always a way.</p>
<p>So there it is. Keep this list at hand. You can even laminate it if you want to. Review it periodically. If you find yourself slipping into more than half of these habits, then you have a problem. You’re acting like a fucking wuss. And you need to correct yourself.</p>
