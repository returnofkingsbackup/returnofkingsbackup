<p>Being able to speak Spanish in Latin America is the mating advantage. Being able to speak Spanish <em>and</em> being an exotic foreigner? You’ll crush it. Foreign languages are an essential part of the international playboy’s arsenal.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll show you how to cut your time-to-Spanish-fluency in half and get better reactions from Latin American girls. Let’s get into it….</p>
<h3>1. Get Obsessed. Get Good.</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-56630" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490-300x202.jpg" alt="Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490" width="370" height="249" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490-300x202.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490-667x449.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490-262x176.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490-574x386.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Machu-Picchu-Peru-728x490.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 370px) 100vw, 370px"></a></p>
<p>People who reach an advanced level in a second language are not interested in the language per se. The language is a vehicle for the real topic that fascinates them – Mexican Banda music, regional accents in Spain, the women in Colombia. <em>Especially</em> the women in Colombia.</p>
<p>Fortunately, fascination and obsession are not states that randomly happen to us, we can engineer them.</p>
<p>Find a subject in a Latin American country and make it your new obsession. This fascination will drive you you through the frustrations and the hours of study needed to get to an advanced level.</p>
<h3>2. Vocabulary – learn 200 words a day</h3>
<p>As with all Latin-based languages, you are not starting from a clean slate. Actually, you probably have over 5,000 words already on that slate. Cognates are words that are similar in English and Spanish e.g. accident = accidente. Cognates are a great way to gain some early confidence in Spanish.</p>
<p>For any vocabulary beyond cognates, use mnemonics. Remember ‘Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge’ when learning the musical note scale of E-G-B-D-F? Get the mnemonic right and you won’t be able to forget the word for years even if you wanted to.</p>
<h3>3. Pronunciation – “I thought you were Colombian. You have no accent!”</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/reinas-calencc83as.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-56631" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/reinas-calencc83as-300x200.jpg" alt="reinas-calencc83as" width="378" height="252" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/reinas-calencc83as-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/reinas-calencc83as-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/reinas-calencc83as.jpg 490w" sizes="(max-width: 378px) 100vw, 378px"></a></p>
<p>People say you can never get rid of a foreign accent. Nonsense. Professional actors do it all the time.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to learn how to roll their r’s but to be understood, syllable stress is much more important.</p>
<p>Even if you master a pitch-perfect Mexican accent, put the stress on the wrong syllable and the word you just said does not exist. On the other hand, you can have a strong gringo twang but if you stress the correct syllable in the word the locals will understand you much better.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of tips if you want to Meryl Streep your Spanish accent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Say words in English with a heavy Spanish accent.</li>
<li>Sing Spanish songs. It will train you to link words together and give your speech more flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>I actually learned to rap in Spanish to fool hispanics that I was more fluent that I actually was.</p>
<h3>4. Grammar – F**K Rosetta Stone</h3>
<p>For years, popular language courses like Rosetta Stone have spread this myth of “learn a language like a toddler learns.” Sounds good in theory, but it’s actually a clever way for them to cut their production costs and add more profit to their bottom line. It’s a good business model, but not a superior method of learning.</p>
<p>It’s better to learn like an adult and leverage the power of associative memorization. Realize that as an adult, you have this pre-existing base of idiomatic English expressions and extensive grammatical knowledge. You can associate 20+ years of English knowledge with your new language through translation or association.</p>
<p>Constructing your sentences first in “Caveman English” and then translating to Spanish will improve your grammar accuracy.</p>
<p>Example: ‘It I want’ – <strong>lo quiero</strong></p>
<h3>5. Material before method</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/latina8.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-56632" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/latina8-300x200.jpg" alt="latina8" width="383" height="255" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/latina8-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/latina8-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/latina8.jpg 459w" sizes="(max-width: 383px) 100vw, 383px"></a></p>
<p>Like with martial arts, guys love to debate about the best language learning method. Michel Thomas vs Pimsleur vs Duolingo. Who wins?</p>
<p>I say before you obsess on the method, ask yourself some tough questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“What do I hope to be doing with the language once I learn it?”</li>
<li>“What kind of conversations do I hope to be having?”</li>
<li>“What will be the content and the contexts of these conversation?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Course content and vocabulary selection should be dictated by your interests and goals. The most important questions is: “What will you spend your time doing with this language?</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>A goal like “Be fluent” is not specific enough to give you any kind of roadmap or plan.</p>
<h3>6. Groove your “Groundhog Day Conversations”</h3>
<p>Focus on the conversations that you will have all the time in Latin America. In a foreign country you will repeatedly give the following speeches every time you meet somebody new:</p>
<ul>
<li>What you are doing in the country.</li>
<li>How long you’ve been here.</li>
<li>What you like about the country.</li>
<li>Why you decided to come to this country.</li>
<li>How long you are planning to stay.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think ahead and rehearse stock answers that make you seem interesting and attractive. Your go-to material when it comes to talking to women in Latin America will be your opinions on her country and its culture. Commit to memory some observations that will spark further conversation.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p><strong>ir al salon es muy importante para las mujeres dominicanas no?</strong> (going to the hair salon is very important for Dominican woman isn’t it?)</p>
<p><strong>veo que a </strong><strong>las colombianas les gusta mucho salir y bailar. en mi pais no es asi</strong> (I see that Colombian women like to go out and dance a lot. It’s not like that in my country.)</p>
<p>Now you’ve got some solid Spanish in your locker, here’s how to get with some curvy, tanned Latinas…</p>
<h3>7. Don’t over-game</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iStock_000022123325XSmall.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-56634" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iStock_000022123325XSmall-300x199.jpg" alt="iStock_000022123325XSmall" width="333" height="221" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iStock_000022123325XSmall-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iStock_000022123325XSmall-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iStock_000022123325XSmall.jpg 425w" sizes="(max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px"></a></p>
<p>It almost pains me to say it but, being a gentleman and giving the girls cheesy compliments earns you major bonus points in Latin America. My ‘red-pill’ instincts are to be aloof and bust their balls but over the years I’ve repeatedly seen US-style game backfire in Latin America.</p>
<p>While provider game and gushing compliments would get you chewed up and spit out in the US, it will work perfectly on Latinas.</p>
<h3>8. Get off Badoo, Cupid, and other Latin dating sites as quickly as possible</h3>
<p>These sites are good for “pipelining” and setting up dates as soon as you get off the plane. However, you’ll want to ditch the training wheels and move on to day game as soon as possible. Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I knew a girl in the Dominican Republic who was a solid 9 and she showed me her Badoo account. She had 900-odd unread messages from guys promising her holidays, expensive gifts etc. It is becoming a crowded channel.</li>
<li>When you are in Latin America you will notice that the quality is <em>so much better</em> on the ground. Do some Spanish day game and you’ll have zero competition and higher quality girls.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are already chatting to a Latina online, get her off the site as quickly as possible and move her to Whatsapp or Skype. The longer you remain her chat buddy, the more likely it is that she’ll be distracted by another gringo in her inbox.</p>
<p>Use this line for the “digital bounce”: <strong>tienes whatsapp por cierto linda? es mas comod</strong><strong>o hablar por ahi </strong>(Do you have Whatsapp? It’s easier to message each other using Whatsapp).</p>
<h3>9. Stand out from the other gringos</h3>
<p>So many gringos come to Latin America and bang “pre-pagos” (pros) or “interesadas” (semi-pros). These guys don’t realize that their wallet and “white God factor” won’t be enough to get the top-of-the-food-chain girls in Latin America.</p>
<p>You don’t want to be guilty by association. Here’s how distance yourself from these guys in the fewest number of steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t do pay-for-play</li>
<li>Speak the local language. Most other guys you’ll meet are too lazy to learn Spanish.</li>
<li>Stay in an apartment not a hotel or hostel.</li>
<li>Have a good “backstory” for being there. (Even if it’s not 100% accurate)</li>
<li>Don’t wear shorts and flip-flops. Fashion and style is the equivalent of the smell of chocolate to women in Latin America.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key is to be able to represent your world (exotic foreigner) but also be comfortable in her world (speak the local language and meet her friends and family).</p>
