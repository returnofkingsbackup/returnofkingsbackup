<p><em>“We are what we repeatedly do.”</em><br>
– Aristotle</p>
<p>There are simple things you do every day that make you happy… And there are simple things you do every day that undermine your happiness.</p>
<p>The trick is being able to identify your habits, and then be able to determine which support you and which are bad for you.</p>
<p>However there are some habits that are universally beneficial for our confidence, happiness, and overall well-being. And, by the same token, there are some habits that are universally toxic.</p>
<p>In this article I want to share seven small hacks that, if applied daily, will have a large impact on your happiness, confidence, productivity, and all-around well-being.</p>
<h3>1. Read 30 minutes per day</h3>
<p>Reading is like an active meditation.</p>
<p>It allows you to focus completely on something outside of your head, and it allows you to learn valuable information at the same time.</p>
<p>However, with all of the video games, TV shows, movies, social media, and smartphones that exist in our culture, there’s a large barrier that prevents most men from ever picking up a book. Fight past this barrier and find 30 minutes to read every day – you’ll feel far more enlightened, happy, and motivated for choosing reading over browsing the internet or watching TV.</p>
<h3>2. Stop watching porn</h3>
<div id="attachment_56959" style="width: 426px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-56959" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-porn.jpg" alt="Porn is unsatisfying and detrimental to your mental health" width="416" height="250" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-porn.jpg 416w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-porn-300x180.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/image-porn-262x157.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Porn is unsatisfying and detrimental to your mental health</p>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.howtobeast.com/porn-addiction-side-effects-and-how-to-quit-porn/" target="_blank">There are many negative side effects to porn addiction</a>. However the worst are probably sexual dysfunction, reduced motivation to have real sex, and the <em>pedestalization </em>effect it has on over-valuing women and sex.</p>
<p>There is no down side to quitting porn. You can always jerk one out without watching other people have sex – and really, this is what makes porn so pathetic. Go have your own sex.</p>
<h3>3. Make fast decisions</h3>
<p>Indecision is so dangerous because it leads to more and more indecision. And indecision almost always creates intense anxiety, that’s usually coupled with a decrease in happiness and self-esteem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtobeast.com/analysis-paralysis-cure-how-to-stop-overthinking-things-and-become-spontaneous/" target="_blank">Stop overthinking things, follow your guy, and practice making small decisions quickly</a>. Choose what you’ll wear, where you’ll go, what you’ll order and when you’ll meet up with hesitating. You’ll waste far less time and be that much happier for it.</p>

</div>
<h3>4. Don’t eat shit</h3>
<div id="attachment_56960" style="width: 427px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-56960" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3873177-1774241683-food-.jpg" alt="Shitty food will make you tired, lethargic, and fat" width="417" height="278" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3873177-1774241683-food-.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3873177-1774241683-food--300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/3873177-1774241683-food--262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Shitty food makes you tired, lethargic, and fat</p>
</div>
<p>The only upside to eating “junk” food is the pleasure of chewing it in your mouth and swallowing it.</p>
<p>Once it’s gone, it’s almost always followed by a decrease in energy and motivation. By simply avoiding shitty food throughout your day, you’ll be operating on a higher plane of existence than the masses of men who eat cheeseburgers, pizza, and ice cream every damn day. And you’ll look a lot better than them, too.</p>
<h3>5. Stop watching the news</h3>
<p>The news is just a big mish-mash of miserable happenings and depressing stories.</p>
<p>The only thing you gain from watching the news is “knowing what’s going on in the world.” And I don’t believe this is really that valuable after all. It’s certainly not worth the added anxiety and stress that hearing all of the other bullshit causes you. Stop wasting your time and stop watching that garbage.</p>
<h3>6. Breathe deeply</h3>
<div id="attachment_56963" style="width: 428px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-56963" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/photolibrary_rf_photo_of_exhausted_man.jpg" alt="Deep breathing is one of the reasons you feel so good after working out" width="418" height="284" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/photolibrary_rf_photo_of_exhausted_man.jpg 493w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/photolibrary_rf_photo_of_exhausted_man-300x204.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/photolibrary_rf_photo_of_exhausted_man-262x178.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Deep breathing is one reason you feel so good after working out</p>
</div>
<p>Focused, conscious breathing is, in my opinion, the absolute most effective way to cure a bad, depressive mood. It’s essentially a meditation in mindfulness.</p>
<p>When you catch yourself feeling anxious, depressed, or shitty – stop and focus on breathing deep breaths through your nose and into your belly. This opens up the front side of the body, where we tend to hold most of our stress and tension, and it calms us down.</p>
<h3>7. Work out</h3>
<p>The fact that working out is beneficial to our health is now common knowledge. It prevents chronic disease, makes us feel better, and <a href="http://www.howtobeast.com/10-diet-and-workout-tips-for-getting-shredded/" target="_blank">makes us look better</a>.</p>
<p>There’s literally NO REASON you shouldn’t be working out every single day. It doesn’t matter if you lift weights, run, cycle, practice a martial art, play a sport, hike, or do anything else physical – but do something. You’re subjecting yourself to shitty moods, a shitty body, and a shitty life expectancy if you don’t.</p>
