<p class="cb-author-bio">Harry is a bitter, angry, misogynist with a small penis and highly insecure infatuation with contact sports. Refusing to man up and contribute positively to society, Harry travels the world taking advantage of poor, third world women while he swindles innocent businessmen in the boardrooms of numerous developing countries. Outright intimidated by sassy, intelligent, super awesome modern women, Harry is an ignorant bigot of epic proportions that mortifies the cultural sensibilities of any typical progressive westerner. He likes to share his views with complete strangers as he comes to terms with the constant shame he feels. Deep down he really just wants someone to actually like him.</p>

<p>There seems to be a belief that has developed in the PUA community where game is so powerful it can even overcome common sense. I often wonder just how much theory is put forward by guys who are actually getting laid with any regularity and how much of what they say is based on real life experience or any noticeable results they have had at all. I cant help but think that for every half decent PUA out there, there are tons of keyboard warriors who simply miss the point completely. I often imagine tons of basement dwelling geeks who seem to think that they can unlock some sort of secret combination of words or actions that will lead them to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. A nice neat formula that they can follow in a systemic manner which helps them overcome the lack of social skills they have.</p>
<p>It does not matter how good your skills are or how good you think your game may be, there are always going to be mitigating circumstances that increase or decrease your chances of getting laid. There are a few basics that either make your life easy or make your life hard. A basic understanding of this will allow you to calibrate your approach accordingly for the sort of results you are looking to achieve.</p>
<h4>Game Is Paper Mache</h4>
<p>Game is the illusion of real social status, its not actual social status. Its a basic understanding of female psychology that allows you to present yourself as someone that gives her the tingles and makes you a fuckable prospect. All you are doing is projecting an aura of high status and pulling on her emotional strings. Its not the be all and end all though, its merely one aspect of a man as a total package. The more a man has to offer as a total package, the hotter the women he is going to fuck on average.</p>
<p>This is something men need to learn to accept. Shit like money counts. So do looks. So does a good body. So does genuine social status. Nothing is ever a complete deal breaker or a prerequisite which is why men are lucky, but the more you have going for you the better your chances are of getting laid and the less effort that will be required on your part.</p>
<p>Your perceived status is relevant to the men around you however, because there needs to be a comparison that is made for any hierarchy to ever exist in the first place. It’s the same with women, whose status is determined predominantly by their looks relevant to the women around them. This is a very basic fundamental and there is no getting away from it.</p>
<p>Simply put, competition determines success for both men and women and it’s why ratios count as much as game, looks, physique or money. When ratios favor women, the end result will be highly picky women with bitch shields a mile high, even though looks-wise they would be considered very average. When the shoe is on the other foot however, women are forced to deal with slimmer pickings and their attitudes will adjust as a result. There is a basic psychology at play here, and the simple fact is that game is nothing more than a play on that psychology at the end of the day. The crappier the ratios, the harder it becomes to adjust for it. Anyone who says that ratios make no difference and good game is good game, simply has no understanding of game or female psychology in the slightest.</p>

<h4>Location Matters More Than You Think</h4>
<p>What this means is that one of the most productive ways to ensure you are maximizing your chances of getting laid with hot women regularly instead of fat, drunk whores is to ensure that you are choosing the right sort of environments in which to concentrate your efforts. I don’t care how good you think your game is, how beta you think everyone else is, there is no getting around the impact ratios will always have on your success rates. A model in a dive bar is high value, that same model at a Victoria’s Secret event is average. This is why you don’t spend your time looking for sausage fests—you look for happy hunting grounds where the ratios are in your favor. Yes, sometimes you can score when competition is high, but your chances are slimmer and the quality you end up with is not always going to be high when you are dealing with average women who have had their own status elevated by all the ugly women surrounding them.</p>
<p>Now with this is mind, I want to get to the point I am trying to make. For some reason, there is a substantial chunk of mentally handicapped “Pick Up Artists” who constantly berate men who prefer to hunt abroad. According to these keyboard warriors, men are going aboard because they cant get laid at home.</p>
<p><em>“If they had game, they would not need to go anywhere”.</em></p>
<p>Clearly, few of these experts have ever traveled.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the only guys fucking swathes of hot, fresh ass the minute they get off the plane are the guys banging out pros and semi pros. Or they are not used to much attention from good looking women back home, and to them one new notch a month is a pretty big deal. Foreign women actually tend to be far more conservative than the Western whores we have the pleasure of dealing with, which means that while they are still women and many do still put out early from time to time, they generally require far more effort in many cases. Throw into the mix cultural differences, language problems, the social pressure on them and the occasional stigma of being a possible sex tourist in some places, and you only complicate things further.</p>
<p>Its not that foreign women require zero game to fuck, it’s just that there are so many hot women the ratios begin to skew in your favor and this gives you more opportunities with hotter women. You think you are on a run, when in reality you are just in a place where the women are hotter on average. This is the miracle of going to countries where obesity has yet to reach epidemic proportions, which is the primary reason why the women are in a different league.</p>
<p>To drive that point home further, and contrary to popular belief yet again, your social status is not elevated simply because you are a foreigner either. In many cases, it can actually be a huge disadvantage for you. If you think the whole world will want to bang you because of the passport you carry, <strong>you are a fool</strong>. Sure, it can be an advantage in some places, but it’s not always the case. In fact, the easiest women to bang are often the Western tourists, who are looking to get drunk and laid while on holiday.</p>
<h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
<p>If you are not hitting new ass regularly at home, getting on a plane is not going to going to solve your problems either. Women are women, attraction is attraction, their options determine attitude as much as their culture will. The only thing that will improve is the quantity of quality women, and not just looks-wise either. They are more feminine and they are more natural. Many do not suffer from the same levels of psychosis and entitlement that Western women do. They are, simply put, far better to spend time with on average and far more pleasant to fuck.</p>
<p>In the end you must ask yourself this question: Why would any sane man want to spend his weekends at an over-fished pond that has been ravaged by pollution, chasing the legend of the big cat fish in the deep, when he can just jump on a plane and spend a few weeks chasing big game instead?</p>
