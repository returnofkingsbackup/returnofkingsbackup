<p>After my previous article, I received a lot of hate mail from social justice warriors, white knights, and feminists who threw a plethora of ad hominem attacks at me, calling me names such as “bigot,” “homophobe,” “fascist,” and the list goes on; however, I personally enjoy reading hate mail from enemies, so I want to add to my “notch count” of insults hurled at me via hate mail, and this time I am guessing it will be Islamaphobe.</p>

I would like to put in a facetious comment if I wasn’t at such a loss of words.</p>
</div>
<p>After watching a recent youtube video created by the <a href="http://www.campusreform.org/?ID=6286">DePaul Feminist Front showing their open support for DePaul Divest</a> (which unfortunately has been taken down), I became intrigued with the dynamics of the liberal and feminist alliances.</p>
<p>One of these alliances that has been formed on all college campuses across the country is between feminists, Marxists, and radical Islamists on the issue of Boycotts Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), which is a movement where these radical islamist groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) try and get their respective universities to boycott companies that do business with or in the state of Israel, based off Israel’s human rights abuses towards the Palestinian people.</p>
<h3>Its completely hypocritical</h3>
<p>Now let’s disregard the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and focus on the issue of this video to start off. In the video that has been recently taken down, the DePaul Feminist Front claims that Israeli “methods of occupation historically target women, through violence, kidnapping, and rape” and that “Israeli forces target queer folks with blackmail.”</p>
<p>Now I want ROK readers of this article to soak in the fact this is coming from feminists in conjunction with Muslims speaking about Israel’s human rights violations. Let us get one thing straight—you may be able to argue that Israel abuses human rights, but you really cannot argue that Israel is the worst human rights abusers against women and homosexuals.</p>
<p>So if the goal is to divest from human rights abusers, shouldn’t feminists and Marxists want to start with countries that have committed the worst human rights atrocities against women and homosexuals? If so, we would have to start with the plethora of Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/24/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death/">that stone homosexuals to death</a>, <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/middle-east/60339/eleven-things-women-in-saudi-arabia-cant-do">do not allow women to drive</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/13/burqa-women-afghanistan-taliban-return">do not allow women to wear anything else but a burka</a>, and <a href="http://globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/12/no-witnesses-no-rape-says-pakistans-islamic-council/">have incredibly perverse legal systems when it comes to violence against women</a>.</p>
<p>However, this would not be liked by their newfound friends who are pushing the divest agenda, because their idiotic sense of prioritization comes from one of two things. Either Students for Justice in Palestine is completely oblivious to the rest of the world, or they are sympathetic to these theocracies that subscribe to their religion, and through that religion engender some of the worst human rights abuses ever to occur on this earth. I would put my money on the latter.</p>

</div>
<h3>Why do these Marxists and feminists even bother?</h3>
<p>I believe feminists do intrinsically understand this notion that I just laid out, but they act the way they do for a purpose. The reason why these idiotic feminists have joined up with radical Islamists is because it has been a tactic of Marxists for a very long time. The idea is to rally every possible fringe element to distort your numbers as much as possible so that your agendas look more to be more serious and have more manpower than they actually are.</p>
<p>This is why in Occupy Wall Street you saw a slew of Communists sitting side by side with Anarchists, two political philosophies diametrically opposed to each other, but happy as can be to join a mutual cause. They go by the tactic “the enemy of my enemy is my friend,” and whoever is fighting the “man” (whether it’s Jews, Christians, whites, males, heterosexuals, etc), these groups become best buddies.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script data-cfasync="false" src="cdn-cgi/scripts/5c5dd728/cloudflare-static/email-decode.min.js"></script><script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>This is why these groups have moved to join the Divest movement, because these fringe groups look at mutual support as “scratch my back I will scratch yours, while helping a good cause.” Furthermore, it helps that Muslims in this day and age have learned to attract these groups by playing the victim card so well, which help feminists and Marxists become entranced with this “struggle of Muslims and the Palestinian people.”</p>
<p>However, the have made a grave miscalculation: radical Islamists will never scratch the back of groups that has members that support homosexuality, atheism, and nihilism (alcohol, drugs,etc), much less members with neon green eyebrows.</p>
<h4>The long game</h4>
<p>What these feminists and Marxists haven’t done is think about the long game their behavior causes. This is typical because many of these acolytes of Marxism have only one concern: “taking down ‘the man.” They really do not care what the hell comes after, and this has terrible repercussions for the rest of society.</p>
<p>When these radical Islamists have gotten more power in the past, they have started to flex their muscles in other aspects of culture. One example is in the aftermath of any mass killing in the name of defending Muhammed, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/europe/france-anti-muslim-threats/">these cultural slime turn the tables on a pathetically weak west, trying to say we are intolerant and ignorant because of increases in anti-Islamic violence and rhetoric increases after</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>I do know one thing—Islam has a long history of having a very strong cultural dominance through forceful suppression of other cultures, which is why they will never move back. The Muslim crowd comes from a culture that has the archaic mindset of conquering distant lands to create a caliphate, and they are well on their way to doing so with their astronomically large birth rates that will eventually tip the scales in their favor.</p>
<p>Christianity had become this way for a while, but we outgrew it, and have become a relatively passive religion that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/piss-christ-andres-serran_n_1909911.html">can handle being insulted by liberals</a>, without having the urge to commit mass beheadings. Islam still has no signs of widespread maturity in the Middle East or anywhere else at that, and I would not count on it happening any time soon.</p>
<p>If feminists think the neophytes of this very strong, inexorably manifesting culture will yield to political correctness and tolerance, the radical islamists will laugh as they cut your head off for being a homosexual if they could. Just like feminists have been trying to defeat the status quo culture for the past 50 years, the radical islamists have recently started their long game in western America, and we are already seeing the consequences.</p>
<p>When the feminists win their long game over the last vestiges of our dying culture, the process for Islamic cultural domination will come that much faster, and when it does come, I don not want to be around to see what happens.</p>
<h4>Hannibal’s personal advice</h4>
<p>Now, I have a soft spot for the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">androgynous wildabeasts</span> DePaul Feminist Front, and would like to personally offer them some advice, because I heard they read my last article. Here is my advice to all feminists and Marxists at DePaul and around the world: you can ally with people you disagree with, but make sure that you fit somewhere into their endgame, because unless you don’t, when you do take total control of our vapid culture you will have previously empowered your current enemies, which is never a good idea. Please learn how to factor in what happens after you win because if you don’t things will get drastically worse for everyone when you do not.</p>
<p>If your groups are so concerned about dealing with human rights, I would suggest along with promoting the ban on Israel, include Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and other Muslim nations that have some of the worst human rights records in the world, demonstrably worse than Israel. But it will never happen because any person with common sense knows what these groups truly are.</p>
<p>These groups are invaders from a distant land looking to destroy us from within. You can truly tell the moral fiber of a group by the way they act and who they affiliate with. The radical Islamist groups I have encountered cause havoc by shutting down parts of campus, by intimidating other students, and by associating with convicted terrorists,</p>
<p>Murphy’s law states that anything that has a possibility of happening will happen, which means that if we tolerate these groups in our own homeland, ourselves or our posterity will live to see the day when radical islamists will not tolerate us.</p>
