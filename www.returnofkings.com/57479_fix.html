<p>It wasn’t until my siblings and I were fully grown that I realized the necessity of investing in your sons. I come from a family of three children, with me being that last in line with two older sisters. Growing up, I’d like to think that we were all raised rather fairly, without too much favoritism towards any one of us in particular.</p>
<p>But like most families, much of the preparation for raising children to become adults starts with the oldest child, and then down to the others. By the time both of my sisters had started college and had strained my parents financially, it was my turn to go to school and there wasn’t much help my parents could offer anymore; I had to work and pay for myself.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t want this to come off as a sob story; “Oh, poor me who had to pay for my own education!” But the results of the money my parents invested in my sisters first compared to their outcomes in life really struck me as to why it is important to invest in your son’s endeavors.</p>
<h4>A Case Study</h4>
<p>My oldest sister, the star child of the group with straight As throughout school, ultimately ended up getting a degree in journalism (no surprise in today’s climate) and has spent the last decade bouncing between odd jobs. By the saving grace of her recent fiancée (an engineer), she now lives comfortably doing whatever she pleases as he works as the breadwinner.</p>
<p>The thousands of dollars that went to her education have ultimately become a waste, and she seems to not have a care in the world about it. She recently lamented that she was “bored with life;” Oh, how hard it must be to have a man taking care of all of your bills while you sit around the house and aren’t out on the streets.</p>
<p>My next sister was the wild child. We were all surprised when she chose to go to college, but in the typical female-child mentality, she decided to get a degree in fashion design. Somewhere down the line, she became a repulsive hairy-armpit overweight vegan, and I shit you not, she now works as a vet tech taking care of cats. Obviously she had no backup plan when her dreams of being a fashionista were doomed to fail.</p>

It can happen to your daughters too.</p>
</div>
<p>I guess the point is, it doesn’t matter what your daughters are going to do. The wild child is ultimately going to end up making poor choices and failing you as a parent, and even your little princess with the most promise will ultimately end up marrying a man who will turn her into a housewife anyway.</p>
<p>So this is why you should invest in your sons. I worked to save money, I learned two different languages, I paid for my own college education (international business), and I’ve spent the last five years living in both Tokyo, Japan and Seoul, South Korea while visiting another dozen countries to boot.</p>
<p>I can only wonder how much easier this process of getting to where I want in life would have been if only my parents had the foresight to understand how their daughters would turn out. Invest in your sons. They’ll get educations, they’ll open businesses, they’ll create wealth for themselves and travel and live the life of men with the world in the palm of their hands. Your daughters will become housewives at best, cat ladies at worst.</p>
