<p>Have you ever wondered how popular Instagram models can afford their lavish lifestyles? All of them post selfies in which they’re showing off expensive sports cars or vacationing in exotic locales, yet they all work low-paid jobs as bartenders or waitresses.</p>
<p>You probably figured some chump was paying for their Louis Vuitton purses and trips to Cabo, but you didn’t know the sheer <em>depths</em> these girls would sink to just for a few bucks.</p>
<p>The man behind the curtain has been revealed, and it’s not a pretty sight. Say hello to <em><a href="http://tagthesponsor.com/">Tag the Sponsor</a>,</em> a blog that exposes Instagram models for the craven whores that they are:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2015 we should stop gassing up these Instagram “Models” like they’re godsent. We are putting them on a pedestal for just showing ass. Too many #CaptainSaveAHoes defending them, like these bitches got some special skills to satisfy you… Instagram model means prostitute, they might as well start to put their rates under the pictures because they won’t be fooling anyone for much longer. We are pro-prostitution. But we are against women who sell pussy and try to put down those who actually work and make a decent living calling them #Basic. We are against fraudulent hoes, pretentiousness and bigotry…</p></blockquote>
<p>As it turns out, most if not all Instagram models make their living by being “sponsored,” meaning <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-45437.html">they get paid to fly to Dubai and have sex with an Arab sheik</a> and ten of his best buddies. But these hoes don’t simply rent their pussies out for cash: they engage in some of the most disgusting sex acts you can imagine. <em>Tag the Sponsor</em> reveals <a href="http://www.insidehoops.com/forum/showthread.php?t=331698">just what these girls are willing to do for a little extra spending money</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes this **** is real, I know a guy who is a “model recruiter” who gets paid to find girls who are basically willing to whore themselves out to rich Saudis with oil money. The Saudis pay anywhere from $10,000 to as much as $50,000 per girl for each trip which last anywhere from a weekend up to 2 weeks and they basically **** the **** out of the girls multiple times a day with with just about every fetish you could imagine including **** and pooping/peeing on the girls. The Saudis take pride in pooping/peeing on the girls and more often than not they make personal bets and hold contests to see who can get the most liquidy poop to drop on the girls faces, the winner gets to choose the next vacation spot and gets to pick his girls first.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right: the girls you see on Instagram with hordes of orbiters proclaiming how they would “suck a fart out of [her] ass” are getting paid to have Arabs squirt diarrhea in their faces. There’s even a colloquial term for these tarts: “Dubai porta potties.”</p>
<p>If <em>Tag the Sponsor</em> doesn’t convince you that we’ve slid all the way to Gomorrah, nothing will. Here we have an entire class of women who are so lacking in decency that they’ll shove salmon up their vaginas so they can afford to shop at Saks Fifth Avenue. A civilization where women sell themselves—not even to survive, but for frivolous luxury items—is a civilization in terminal decline.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-57590" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dubai-instagram.jpg" alt="dubai-instagram" width="500" height="500" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dubai-instagram.jpg 778w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dubai-instagram-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dubai-instagram-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dubai-instagram-667x667.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dubai-instagram-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dubai-instagram-574x574.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<h3>How Selling Sex Corrupts Women</h3>
<p>Absent from the debate on pornography, prostitution and the like is the <em>spiritual </em>element. The central problem with sex work isn’t disease, degeneracy, or the Bible’s disapproval. Transactional sex inherently ruins the souls of both women <em>and</em> men. I witnessed this first hand.</p>
<p>The Philippines, <a href="http://mattforney.com/filipinocupid-the-easiest-way-to-bang-filipinas/">where I lived for part of last year</a>, has a large and visible sex industry. Beyond the seedy strip joints and freelancer-filled expat bars in Manila, there’s a sizable number of “normal” Filipinas <a href="http://delicioustacos.com/2015/02/23/philippines-vacation/">who will accept money for sex if you proposition them the right way</a>. Morons assume that Filipino girls are selling themselves out solely because of poverty, but the reality is more complicated than that.</p>
<p>The typical Filipina prostitute is a working-class girl, poor but not destitute. She lives with her family, doesn’t have a college degree, and is a single mother more often than not. She whores herself out not out of desperation, but<em> avarice. </em>By Philippine standards, prostitutes, particularly young ones, make a damn good living. One girl I talked to at L.A. Cafe told me that she made up to 7,000-8,000 pesos a night (about $160-180) sleeping with tourists.</p>
<p>While it’s true that most retail-type jobs in the Philippines pay horribly—say maybe 5,000 pesos a month (about $110), <a href="http://mattforney.com/dating-banging-girls-philippines/">and you’ll be working twelve hours a day, six days a week</a>—these girls have a social safety net in the form of their family. They’re not in danger of becoming homeless and they live in <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/44670/6-things-white-girls-can-learn-from-filipinas">a society that values chastity and traditional morals</a>. They whore themselves out because they’re <em>greedy,</em> because money is worth more to them than virtue.</p>

</div>
<p>And frankly, it catches up to them quickly. The girl I talked to could charge so much because she was both young and cute. To give you a comparison, a few days later, I was at a club in Malate when a fat, thirtyish hooker offered me “boom-boom” for 1,000 pesos. She was ugly enough that I wouldn’t have let her pay <em>me.</em> At the same time, I felt sorry for her: charging foreigners discount prices on blowjobs has got to be a depressing existence.</p>
<p>Other examples abound of how sex work degrades women. For example, Miriam Weeks, who became famous last year as the “Duke porn star” Belle Knox, <a href="https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/porn-is-super-empowering-just-ask-the-duke-university-porn-star">recently admitted in an interview</a> that the porn industry had made her “cynical” and “bitter.” This is why <a href="http://mattforney.com/getting-on-the-cross-miriam-weeks-belle-knox-vs-the-slut-industrial-complex/">it’s incredibly irresponsible for the media to hold up women like Weeks</a> as heroes. While not all women who end up in the sex industry will be ruined by it, <a href="http://youtu.be/EwEcOlFw5B0">enough do that it’s not a choice any sane society encourages girls to make</a>.</p>
<p>The Instagram models getting trolled by <em>Tag the Sponsor</em> have sipped from a poisoned chalice. Their souls are being warped by the repulsive acts their sponsors make them do. Even if they luck out and manage to find a chump who will marry them knowing what they’ve done, the memories of the sick acts they’ve committed will haunt them for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>I wager more than a few Instagram models will become drug addicts (if they aren’t already) and commit suicide before they turn 40.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-57591" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hard-work-tag-the-sponsor.jpg" alt="hard-work-tag-the-sponsor" width="500" height="500" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hard-work-tag-the-sponsor.jpg 640w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hard-work-tag-the-sponsor-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hard-work-tag-the-sponsor-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hard-work-tag-the-sponsor-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/hard-work-tag-the-sponsor-574x574.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<h3>How Paying For Sex Corrupts Men</h3>
<p>There’s another aspect to <em>Tag the Sponsor</em> that hasn’t been discussed: the <em>men</em> who are blowing obscene sums of money so they can use pretty girls as outhouses. Again, observing the Philippine sex industry allows me to see how sex work degrades the men who partake in it.</p>
<p>Women like to flatter themselves by thinking that all they need to do is show up, look hot and men will be turned on. It’s not that simple. <a href="http://mattforney.com/generation-masturbation/">Men <em>need</em> an emotional connection to the women they bang</a> in order to enjoy themselves. I’m not talking about <em>twoo wove,</em> either: booze-fueled lust is more than enough.</p>
<p>If a man tries to bang a woman who is clearly not into him, who isn’t giving off those pheromones of lust, his own body will revolt against him (<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/55806/20-signs-that-were-not-living-in-a-patriarchy">this is why rape, despite feminist claims, is so rare</a>).</p>
<p>There’s a reason why whoremongers in Southeast Asia have to pop Viagra in order to get it up with hookers, and it’s not because they have erectile dysfunction. It’s because their bodies know that the hookers don’t like them and are only sleeping with them for the money. Using artificial drugs is the only way they can trick their dicks into overcoming their innate repulsion to having sex with an unwilling girl.</p>
<p>In the specific case of these Arab sheiks, these are men who are wealthier and more privileged then the kings of old. But instead of using their fortunes to advance science, culture or philosophy, they pay women to have sex with German shepherds. They are degenerates in every sense of the word, fools who have squandered a great gift on pointless hedonism.</p>

<h3>Get Those Girls Off That Pedestal</h3>
<p>If there’s one good thing about <em>Tag the Sponsor,</em> it’s this:<em> it’ll help countless men stop sucking up to women.</em></p>
<p>Here’s some cold, hard truth: <em>there are no snowflakes. </em>There are good women out there, yes, but as a whole, girls do not deserve your worship or praise. They are just people, nothing more. And in the case of the Instagram models, there’s no reason to be intimidated by beautiful women. That drop-dead gorgeous girl you’re crushing on is likely getting paid to have a Saudi sheik shit on her nose and watch it drip down her chin.</p>
<p>The next time you’re tempted to Like a girl’s selfie on Facebook or write a slobbering comment about how good she looks, just think of the “Dubai porta potties” and smile.</p>
