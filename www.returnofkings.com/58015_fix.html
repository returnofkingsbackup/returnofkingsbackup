<p>First time users of the red pill are shocked to learn that feminism has saturated everything. It’s not merely a fringe movement. Feminism is a primary color of 20th century Eurocentric liberalism.</p>
<p>Even non-feminist women want to absolve themselves of guilt when a relationship tanks. It’s a natural human reaction to failure. And society is ready and willing to help them with it. Here are five things that enable women to avoid their share of blame for a failed relationship.</p>
<h3>1. Movies</h3>
<p>Women are the big market share in the movie industry. Romantic movies are almost exclusively marketed towards them, and even most man movies about action heroes have a romantic subplot. Did you ever think it was weird that Christian Bale’s Bruce Wayne had a perfectly shaved chest?</p>
<div id="attachment_58018" style="width: 610px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/christian-bale-shirtless.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-58018" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/christian-bale-shirtless.jpg" alt="Even near-homeless in the mountains of China, Bruce Wayne keeps groomed." width="600" height="450" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/christian-bale-shirtless.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/christian-bale-shirtless-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/christian-bale-shirtless-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/christian-bale-shirtless-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Even near-homeless in the mountains of China, Bruce Wayne keeps himself groomed.</p>
</div>
<p>Women today are extra picky about what stimuli they receive, so movies are usually careful to tell women what they want to hear.</p>
<p>If a marriage is falling apart because the husband is working too much, the husband isn’t portrayed as a hard-working man making personal sacrifices to provide for his family. Instead, he just isn’t loving them enough. He’s too distant. The problem isn’t her ungratefulness. It’s that she doesn’t <em>feel </em>love.</p>
<p>Love is never defined in these films. When the couple fights, they never have a philosophical discussion about the nature of love, marriage, or paternalism. Instead they just spit words, and the husband gets extra angry, showing him to be the bad guy. Women are almost never blamed for the failure of the relationship in movies.</p>
<p>That being said, <em>Don Jon</em>‘s subplot about romantic comedies destroying women’s ability to love was a major reason I loved that movie.</p>
<h3>2. Friends</h3>
<p>Women always want their friends to have the same relationship status (and same sexual experience) as they themselves have. This can be a very good thing, for example, in a society where everyone marries fairly young and <a href="https://dalrock.wordpress.com/2015/02/22/she-isnt-getting-enough-dates/">women naturally find themselves doing the matchmaking</a>.</p>
<p>But today we live in a society of whores and narcissists. Did you divorce your husband over something stupid? Well, instead of admitting fault for it, just remember that half your friends already have, and the other half should as well.</p>
<p>I’m not sure women are able to understand their motivations for their actions. Granted, I’m not sure anybody truly can, but women especially run on autopilot. At least I assume so, but even Freud drew a blank when trying to figure out the female mind.</p>
<h3>3. Daytime Talk Shows</h3>
<p>When I was a child, my grandparents told me that TV was mostly filth. I scoffed at this idea. Now I understand.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/5CNHwhHWPoQ.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>That video is so awful, even <a href="http://jezebel.com/wendy-williams-says-its-okay-to-trick-a-man-into-gettin-1567980067">Jezebel</a> wrote against it. An audience member asks Wendy Williams if she should trick her husband into giving her another child as promised years ago, and Wendy gives her the usual “my body, my business” lack of reproachability. Wendy ignores that a part of the man’s body (his sperm) will make a major impact on his life without his foreknowledge or consent.</p>
<p>Notice the audience looked really uncomfortable with the question and then broke into applause as soon as Wendy gave the approval. <a title="All Women Are Sheep" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/17452/all-women-are-sheep">All women are sheep.</a> The video above is hard evidence that women have no internal sense of absolute morality, no matter how much I personally try to disbelieve it.</p>
<p>Although the above is an extreme example, daytime talk shows are full of terrible messages. The enlightened woman only wants to experience something if the experience is on her terms. Women who watch these shows want some weird cocktail of being a domestic goddess with a sense of independent agency.</p>
<p>Women’s media today is a sorority of misandry. Or if not hatred of men, then at least a depreciatory view of them. Or if not a depreciatory view of men, then at least an inflated view of women.</p>

<p>These shows often focus on relationships, because that’s something women have learned to become retarded at. The dogma of the day is to “find someone who won’t try to change you.” I don’t know what that means. I’ve never met a man who tried to change a woman’s personality. Maybe it happens, but I don’t know what it looks like. Nor do I understand why a man would want to, since there’s no shortage of pretty young girls.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, women assume that if a relationship doesn’t work out, they must just not be right for each other. “He leaves the cap off the toothpaste. Clearly we can’t get along.” She just picked the wrong guy. Or maybe he changed. Or maybe he lied about who he was. This ignores that <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-22/features/sc-fam-0821-arranged-marriage-20120821_1_marriages-free-choice-satisfaction">arranged or semi-arranged</a> marriages often yield very positive results in satisfaction and happiness.</p>
<p>Marriage is hard work. You have two people with very different brain wiring trying to live as one. Love is not a feeling but a commitment. It is a choice to persevere every day especially when it is difficult. And I would argue that you cannot truly love someone until they have hurt you deeply.</p>
<h3>4. Bullshit Activism On Their Facebook Feed</h3>
<p>It’s never a woman’s fault in any amount if she’s beaten by her husband or raped in a frathouse. It must be the man’s fault and only his fault. Women bare no responsibility for the consequences of their choices. Otherwise, if we assign some kind of cautionary warning to women about safety, then, well, I’m not sure what will happen. Feminists never got that far in their explanation.</p>
<p>I guess women wouldn’t be as likely to bring accusations, except pursuing justice is a separate thing from giving advice about being safe. And it doesn’t make men think it’s okay to beat or rape women, because most of the blame is still applied to the perpetrators. And if a man does beat or rape a woman, the other men in his life will likely kick his teeth in for it.</p>
<p>Jane Housewife isn’t quietly knitting when her husband barges into the room and slaps her silly. Usually if a man hits a woman, she’s been provoking him for an extended period of time. It doesn’t make it right for the man to hit her, but what is worse is telling a woman to be unconcerned with real danger. Men are naturally violent, which <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/2011/03/violence-is-golden/">can be a very good thing</a>. We’re naturally fixers, and we’re hands-on people.</p>
<p>But like women above trying to make their friends have the same relationship status, men’s violent propensities turn ugly in the wrong contexts. As a society, we should be doing everything to avoid these situations, no matter who feels uncomfortable or scared.</p>
<h3>5. Men Who Aren’t Invested In The Situation</h3>
<p>We all want to feel like a good person. We want to help the helpless. And who is more helpless than women?</p>
<p>Being a white knight is one of the supreme virtues today right behind being anti-racist. Defending women from bad men or telling them <a href="https://blairnaso.wordpress.com/2015/02/24/men-only-deceive-women-if-the-women-let-them-because-cheap-and-whore-are-not-synonyms/">when men are being manipulative</a> is what the good people do. The good people empower others.</p>
<p>The road to hell is paved with <a title="How The Vegan Cat Principle Shows The Toxic SJW Mindset" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/55710/how-the-vegan-cat-principle-shows-the-toxic-sjw-mindset">good intentions</a>. If women are always saved from the consequences of their actions, how will they ever grow? And that’s not just a woman thing; that’s a people thing.</p>
<p>Unless a woman is truly in a dangerous situation and has no escape, then let her deal with her own problems. Ray Rice’s wife doesn’t need or <em>want</em> you to stick up for her.</p>
<p>This especially comes from modern <a title="College Showed Me The Cultish Nature Of Feminized Christianity" href="http://www.returnofkings.com/48823/college-showed-me-the-cultish-nature-of-feminized-christianity">church</a>. Pastors like Mark Driscoll and<a href="https://dalrock.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-wake-up-call/"> Tim Keller</a> coddling single mothers and bored housewives aren’t helping anything except their own wallets.</p>
<p>But I’m not so calloused to think that all these people are merely trying to make a living at whatever ideological cost. I think most of progressivism is people trying to feel like a good person, especially when deep down they feel like failures. <a href="https://blairnaso.wordpress.com/2015/01/10/why-you-the-individual-are-a-bad-person/">It’s a fixation</a> we as society need to get past. Be moral, sure, but don’t do it so you can feel smug about it.</p>
