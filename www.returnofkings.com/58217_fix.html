<p><del></del>Sheryl Sandberg is one <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/margiewarrell/2014/03/14/instead-of-banbossy-how-about-embracebossy/">bossy</a> woman.</p>
<p>Instead of pitching her feminist ideologies to a target audience, like Jezebel or Buzzfeed, she has decided to infiltrate the NBA. The intrusiveness will appear on a television near you, via the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12423848/facebook-executive-sheryl-sandberg-nba-team-get-men-lean-women">“Lean-in” campaign</a>. Sandberg has partnered with the NBA to fight for women’s rights at home and at work, and she has even managed to enlist the services of Lebron James and Stephen Curry. For the next two months, the NBA will be delivering public announcements on major TV networks.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Sandberg went on ESPN to promote the plan. There is enough bullshit in the accompanying article to fertilize an Iowa corn field. Let me just critique the major points:</p>
<h4>1. Sandberg is hoping to persuade men that they will be better off financially and emotionally if they take more responsibility for housework and child care, while also backing equal rights for women at work.</h4>
<p>Immediately, we see that she is an expert at conflating the issues.</p>
<p>The “Lean-in” program is good because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Men will be better off financially if they take more responsibility for housework and childcare</li>
<li>Men will be better off emotionally if they take more responsibility for housework and childcare</li>
<li>Men should also back equal rights for women at work</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Man-Doing-Chores-81174613828.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59139" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Man-Doing-Chores-81174613828-300x226.jpeg" alt="Man-Doing-Chores-81174613828" width="300" height="226" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Man-Doing-Chores-81174613828-300x226.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Man-Doing-Chores-81174613828-262x197.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Man-Doing-Chores-81174613828.jpeg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Each of these points need to be examined on their own merit. Then, after a careful review of the evidence, a conclusion can be drawn. Let me save you the time of researching the points. Her goal is to confuse the listener; that way, they’ll be more likely to support her primary claim (that the NBA needs the “Lean-in” Program).</p>
<p>In a sales pitch, this is calling “spinning the client.” You confuse them right away, which breaks down their wall of defense–this then allows you to sell them a used car, or a Florida time share.</p>
<p>Sandberg also employs the “argument by assertion” fallacy—if you say something enough times, it eventually becomes true and you win the argument. People have heard the “women are oppressed” argument so many times, that they now accept the claims at face value.</p>
<h4>2. “Gender equality doesn’t just benefit women, it benefits men in lots of ways,” Sandberg said in an interview with The Associated Press.</h4>
<p>Is gender equality good for men? Let’s take a look at statistics regarding gender “equality” in the Western world:</p>
<ul>
<li>– The 2016 US budget will <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2vaeul/obama_says_men_you_dont_count_as_he_eliminates/">eliminate all funding for prostate cancer</a>; meanwhile, breast cancer will retain its funding (Note that more men in the US die of prostate cancer, than women of breast cancer).</li>
<li>Men are sentenced to<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/11/men-women-prison-sentence-length-gender-gap_n_1874742.html"> longer prison terms</a> than women for the same crime.</li>
<li>97% of the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/emmajohnson/2014/11/20/why-do-so-few-men-get-alimony/">alimony received</a> in the US goes to women.</li>
<li>In France, <a href="http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/france-upholds-the-ban-on-paternity-tests/">men are prohibited from conducting a paternity test</a> (even if they know the child is not theirs).</li>
</ul>
<p>The statistics show that the feminist version of “equality” has not been favorable for men. A lot of guys are afraid of gender equality, and for good reason. It’s merely a talking point, divorced from reality. A growing number of men are affected by misandry, not misogyny.</p>

<h4>3. Among other things, she believes most women are likely to have sex with their husbands or partners more frequently when they get more help at home — a phenomenon she has branded as “choreplay.”</h4>
<p>“Choreplay” is one of those terms that feminists love–a clever play on words, which momentarily validates their existence. They can use these terms to publish dissertations that nobody will read, or to fund non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>But on to the point at hand. Are women turned on when men do the dishes, or iron shirts? Team feminism has done a good job at trying to convince us so. However, recent research is now proving otherwise:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2013, a <a href="http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/01/29/more-sex-for-married-couples-with-traditional-divisions-of-housework/">study showed</a> that people in more traditional marriages have better sex lives (American Sociological Review)</li>
<li>A study in New Zealand from 2014 found the same <a href="http://www.politicalforum.com/womens-rights/380987-study-finds-people-more-traditional-marriages-have-better-sex-lives.html">results</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And let’s not forget the recent success of <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>. Women across the Western world went into a tizzy over Christian Grey. And what kind of character was he? Was he a male feminist, busy ironing shirts before his wife got home from work? Hell no. He was an Alpha male with an edge, who liked tying up girls and then treating them like dirty little whores.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion and recommendation</strong></h3>
<p>Sheryl Sandberg is another social justice warrior, trying to force her ideologies on the American public. Sport lovers need to be concerned. Gone are the days when, after a long day at work, you could tune out the world by watching the ballgame. Now, thanks to people life Sheryl Sandberg, you’ll be drilled with political talking points.</p>
<p>But of course, it takes two to tango. Today’s athletes are also to blame. Men like Lebron James and Stephen Curry have, essentially, sold out the American male. They have enough money, so why are they doing this? We can only assume that they, like Sandberg, believe in political feminism. They need to learn from the stars of yesterday–men like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan; none of these stars would preach feminism to their fans.</p>
<p>I’m calling for a 2015 boycott of the NBA. These industries need to be reminded that <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/02/which-sports-have-the-whitest-richest-oldest-fans/283626/">their viewership is predominantly male (70%)</a>. We no longer accept the SJW agenda, and we will vote with our dollars. This means the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>No paying for NBA tickets</li>
<li>No buying NBA merchandise</li>
<li>No watching NBA on television</li>
<li>No clicking onto NBA online links to check for scores</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/strike.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-58230" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/strike.jpg" alt="strike" width="316" height="237"></a></p>
<p>Secondly, I ask you to call bullshit on the “Lean-in” program in online forums. A simple Google search will take you to the available links. We need to let the NBA know that we do not accept their current direction.</p>
<p>It’s time to take our money elsewhere.</p>
