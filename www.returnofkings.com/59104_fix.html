<p>“Like millions of people across the globe, my husband and I are outraged and heartbroken over the kidnapping of more than 200 Nigerian girls from their school dormitory in the middle of the night,” Michelle Obama began <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/10/michelle-obama-nigeria-schoolgirls-kidnapping-boko-haram">her address to the public</a> in May 2014. “This <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/unconscionable"><span data-dobid="hdw">unconscionable</span></a> act was committed by a terrorist group determined to keep these girls from getting an education. Grown men attempting to snuff out the aspirations of young girls.”</p>
<p>Michelle then keeps blathering on for solid four minutes with a constipated look on her face. She mentions faith, female potential, strength, how educated women power economic growth, the importance of courage women must have to pursue a better life for themselves, and so on.</p>
<p>Michelle was, and arguably still is, the most powerful woman on the planet. She can take action! She can show us how a woman handles business just as good as a man does, or even better! Come on, Michelle, show us what you’ve come up with!</p>

<p>She hijacked the spotlight Mr. Obama generally uses to deliver important political and economic news and directed it onto herself. And what did she teach us? That social media activism can stop terrorists?</p>
<h3>Taking the blinds off</h3>
<div id="attachment_59114" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/trash-mountain-01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-59114 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/trash-mountain-01.jpg" alt="trash mountain-01" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/trash-mountain-01.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/trash-mountain-01-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/trash-mountain-01-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Never mind, these fuckers are actually having fun</p>

<p>Though laughable, Michelle’s address regarding Boko Haram’s kidnapping of over 200 Nigerian girls in 2014 reveals many secrets hidden in plain sight. You can find out everything about how the world functions, if you can read between the lines. Be warned, as once you see things in this light, you will never be able to go back to being naive and mistakenly believing women are inherently altruistic.</p>
<p>Michelle was on the verge of tears when talking about those Nigerian girls. But why would she give two shits about them? She lives halfway across the world and has all the amenities she could ever ask for. Besides, there are millions of other men, women, and children living in utter poverty, filth, and sickness on a daily basis.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Instead of doing some concrete action, a woman will rather emphatically urge others to do something, also known as nagging. This is because women are inherently solipsistic and first and foremost care about their own sanity. Nagging others into action gives a woman <em>the good feels</em> that come from solving a problem while at the same time making her immune to any and all possible criticism if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Women also cannot empathize with men, but can with other women. This is why Michelle didn’t bother to make the same plea when <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/03/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-kidnapping/">Boko Haram kidnapped 40 boys and men</a>. Why would she? They’re just boys, after all. Hence, men are perfect targets for nagging.</p>
<h3>Chronic backstabbing disorder</h3>
<div id="attachment_59116" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sandbox.jpg"><img class="wp-image-59116 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sandbox.jpg" alt="sandbox" width="500" height="317" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sandbox.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sandbox-300x190.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/sandbox-262x166.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Round one – FIGHT!</p>
</div>
<p>All women possess an in-group preference towards other women and this is their default worldview. This means that a woman you thought you knew and loved can and will instantly turn against you and side with an inconsequential unknown woman. It doesn’t matter what happened, it’s your fault and the woman is the victim.</p>
<p>One sole exception to this rule is a mother and her son, which is why even the hardcore feminists start to rethink their beliefs once the baby boy gets charged with sexual assault when he smacks the girl that took his toys.</p>
<p>The horrifying implication of this is that no woman is truly capable of loyalty. Not towards man, not towards any ideal, nothing. A woman answers only to her biological imperatives and knows no honor. She will attach herself to a man and use his resources and status to cruise through life on easy mode.</p>
<p>When she’s done with him, she will simply switch to another man and keep on draining. The old patriarchal society harshly punished such nonchalant behavior towards men, but today’s SJW societies will support and assist women in doing so all the way up to “crazy cat lady” category and beyond.</p>
<h3>Rising through the ranks</h3>
<p>There is nothing you can change about this situation except yourself. You will do so by adapting and using this knowledge to your benefit. Understanding the motives of women around you is all you need to achieve romantic success or, at the very least, avoid a catastrophe. It’s important to note that you ought not resent women for being like this. It’s simply their nature gone wild.</p>
<p>Your status is everything you have. Everything you do on a daily basis contributes to who you are as a man. Therefore you must always stay vigilant and allow nobody to ruin your status under any circumstances. Don’t associate yourself with those who willfully stay infirm.</p>
<p>Rather, always seek the smartest, the strongest, and the most able and learn from them. As you progress through life, you will accumulate status and this will give you more options in all aspects of life—work, health, sex, friends. And that, my friends, is the very definition of freedom.</p>
