<p>As we begin to formulate a manifesto around the <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/neomasculinity">reinvigoration of masculinity</a>, I believe that we, and society as a whole, need to devote a solid plank in our platform to white knight shaming. Simply put, I have come to believe that white knighting is <em>the single biggest problem</em> with modern men. If we are to revive masculinity as a major contributor to fixing the degenerate Western world, white knight shaming must have a significant place in it.</p>
<h3>The Problem:</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-45783-post-975626.html#pid975626">As I have mentioned once on the forum</a>, white knighting is the primary currency that enables entitled attitudes and attention whoring amongst all too many of today’s women. While smartphones and social media greatly enhance attention whoring capabilities, white knights are the buyers of what attention whores sell.</p>
<p>Put simply, white knights are the primary reason that the sexual market is so heavily distorted in favor of women in today’s environment. Let’s take a very recent example to illustrate this point further.</p>
<p>We all know that this winter was particularly brutal for the Boston area, which received several feet of snow in very short order. Economic activity shrunk drastically in the city and getting around was a massive inconvenience to everyone. But life isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, and one should expect this by choosing to live in such an area. It’s 2015, and we know the seasonal weather report.</p>
<p>Enter Susan Zalkind, a 27-year-old Tinder user who came up with a brilliant idea – find some chump to shovel out her car from the snow.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-59436" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq-300x374.jpg" alt="ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq" width="521" height="650" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq-300x374.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq-667x832.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq-262x327.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq-574x716.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ve6cfxgbvponsikhjizq.jpg 821w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px"></a></p>
<p>Notice how she doesn’t offer an inkling of <em>anything</em> in return, not even a cup of hot chocolate as one acquaintance of mine suggested. The arrogance of her request is clearly present in her tagline, and the entitlement apparent on her face.</p>
<p>You would think that no man would possibly respond to such an arrogant, entitled request. You’d be wrong. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/woman-uses-tinder-to-find-a-guy-to-shovel-her-car-2015-3">At least 11 white knights gleefully offered their shoveling services, no doubt in the utterly naïve hope that they’d get some pussy.</a></p>
<p>It is chumps like these that allow women to continue to behave in this manner. It is only natural for women like this to attempt to get something for nothing since there are so many thirsty guys out there that will throw themselves at her. Why would anyone <em>not</em> take such freebies when they know they’re easily available?</p>
<h3>What is a white knight?</h3>
<div id="attachment_59437" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MarioPeach.png"><img class="wp-image-59437" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MarioPeach-300x169.png" alt="MarioPeach" width="500" height="282" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MarioPeach-300x169.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MarioPeach-667x376.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MarioPeach-262x148.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MarioPeach-574x323.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MarioPeach.png 760w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It doesn’t actually work this way.</p>
</div>
<p>Now that we’ve gone over the backbone of the problem with a recent example, we must define what a white knight is. Regulars around these parts will certainly know. This portion is mainly for the benefit of newbies to Return of Kings and to our corner of the internet in general.</p>
<p>A white knight can be most easily defined as <em>a man who does things for women with no clear indication that his labors will be rewarded</em>. The white knight is the servient party in a one-sided interaction, often at the expense of his own interests. This labor is usually done with the hope by the white knight that he will receive female approval and ultimately sexual favors in return for his efforts, but the opposite is true.</p>
<p>To make a clarification, doing a favor for your girlfriend or a female friend is not white knighting, as these things generally take place within the context of a pre-existing relationship with some commitment to each other by both parties. White knighting is more specifically willingly taking up a <em>subservient</em> role on a woman’s behalf with the expectation of some kind of future (usually sexual) reward based solely on the actions performed within that role. It is, putting it even more simply, <em>a man willingly submitting himself to a woman’s will in the hopes that she will like him for doing things for her</em>.</p>

<h3>Why white knighting doesn’t work</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/internet_white_knight_colored_4350.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59438" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/internet_white_knight_colored_4350-300x237.jpg" alt="internet_white_knight_colored_4350" width="300" height="237" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/internet_white_knight_colored_4350-300x237.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/internet_white_knight_colored_4350-262x207.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/internet_white_knight_colored_4350.jpg 330w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Does the above description sound like you? If it does, you are not alone. We’ve probably all had bouts of white knight behavior at some point in our lives. The most important thing is to recognize and fix this behavior immediately. <strong><em>If you do not, you are part of the problem and deserve all the public shaming you can get.</em></strong></p>
<p>Women are, to put it simply, attracted to superior men. Men that are bigger, taller, stronger, higher in status, wealthier, <em>more powerful</em> than they are, are the men that women are attracted to. A woman <em>will not</em> be attracted to an inferior man.</p>
<p>White knights, by definition, willingly put themselves in positions of inferiority to the women they desire. What “men” like Zalkind’s suitors need to realize is that by blindly acquiescing to her wish and shoveling out her car, they are willingly lowering their own status and rendering themselves inferior. This is <em>repulsive behavior</em>, and no woman will give any sexual favors to the chumps that so willingly do things for them with hopes of their approval.</p>
<p>In other words, it would have been more attractive for these guys to say they would shovel Zalkind’s car out and then not show up. This would have at least shown some dignity and self-respect. Alas, this did not happen. The white knights are simply, to quote a female friend: “too stupid to realize” why white knighting is not attractive.</p>
<h3>It’s not just about the game</h3>

<a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/944839-mordred.jpg"><img class="wp-image-59448 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/944839-mordred-300x497.jpg" alt="944839-mordred" width="300" height="497" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/944839-mordred-300x497.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/944839-mordred-262x434.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/944839-mordred.jpg 302w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The true face of the white knight.</p>
</div>
<p>White knighting is a social problem that goes far beyond the world of dating. By men refusing l to hold women responsible for their actions, they as a class are getting a free ride. By wifing up <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/58908/cassandra-lynns-death-shows-why-you-should-never-wife-up-broken-girls">unstable women</a>, women that are unquestionably beneath them in looks or personality, single mothers (with their accompanying bastards), and all other sorts of degenerates, men are encouraging shitty behavior in women and ultimately working against their own interests.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-45845.html">These are the same men that also support the <em>politicization</em> of women’s entitlement, namely feminism</a>. Although I fully know to expect it by now, the pictures of white knights usually do not betray attractive men. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/58217/why-you-need-to-boycott-the-nba">Their only sexual strategy is to white knight by supporting any demand, no matter how obscene, made by women</a>. <a href="http://www.asanet.org/journals/ASR/Feb13ASRFeature.pdf">Predictably, it fails</a>, but their failure to get laid has serious social consequences.</p>
<p>In the social and political realm, the white knight willingly sacrifices his own political and economic interests, and more importantly, those of other men, to be seen as a kind of “good man,” a “progressive” man that is “a good ally” of the right causes, all so he can assuage his ridiculous feelings of guilt and get female attention.</p>
<p>This is all an extension of a very checkered history. It was white knighting that was the primary impetus for some of the most disgusting episodes in our nation’s history, like Jim Crow and segregation. For all the proof you need of this, see D.W. Griffith’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Birth-Nation-Civil-Lincoln-Rise/dp/B00BUAPOXM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1427167936&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Birth+of+a+Nation&amp;tag=rok0f-20"><em>Birth of a Nation</em></a>.</p>
<p>The White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the terrorist group that stood in stark opposition to the ending of segregation in the 1960’s, is a name all too telling. In their ridiculous desire to “save” women (of a particular kind not altogether different from the kind we see white knights trying to “save” today), white knights in the South were the chief oppressors of their fellow men. The same is true now.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It has long been an established social custom among women to slut shame, even to this day. For all our sexual openness, players know all too well that if a girl is made to feel like a slut, or more importantly, thinks her friends will think she’s a slut, all sexual activity on her end will be shut down.</p>
<p>Women self-regulate to keep their market power strong. This is the primary reason why women slut shame, whether they admit it or not. It is long overdue that men self-regulate in the same way by shaming and ostracizing white knights.</p>
