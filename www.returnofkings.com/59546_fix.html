<p class="cb-author-bio">Jack Daniels Unwin is an aspiring author currently employed in the medical field and is a former ET employee of NASA. Being fluent in 4 languages including the language of seduction makes communication a lot simpler with the human females. He once asked out a deaf girl in sign but she signed him back with a middle finger so he took it as a no. Having worked for various other government agencies during his lifetime allowed him to reach a simple conclusion: all of them sucked. Sadly he was never a secret agent although he wouldn't mind becoming one if it meant rescuing several damsels in distress, and that dress.</p>

<p>A few articles on ROK have touched upon basic biblical wisdoms and how they can apply to us here in the manosphere. What they haven’t elaborated upon is just how useful God’s biblical advice is regarding the leadership role of men and what His vision is for the interactions of men and women.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that God views (through his representatives) the phenomena of females controlling males aka feminism as utterly revolting. To that effect, I’m going to list just three verses for your perusal. These are from the Old Testament, so a proper temporal context is recommended.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Gen 3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire <em>shall be</em> to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</strong></h4>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/us-flag-and-bible-cross.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-42269" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/08/us-flag-and-bible-cross.jpg" alt="us-flag-and-bible-cross" width="461" height="369"></a></p>
<p>“…thy desire shall be to thy husband…rule over thee” is key.  Here in the Old Testament, God himself is essentially saying that a woman’s natural state is to long for a husband, and a man’s natural role is to be a ruler over his wife. She can thank her actions in the Garden of Eden for this little fact (as well as the punishment suffering) which most of us are already familiar with. Paul later adapted this to mean “head” for the New Testament Christian but a leadership role is apparent in either case.</p>
<p>How many examples have we seen in society where females have claimed that they don’t need men, yet in magazines and even within their own bizarre behaviors the truth has shown much to the contrary?</p>
<p>With regard to marriage, the feminist movement (along with homosexuals and the pro-abortion supporters) has long tried to wage war on this religious institution for the purpose of marginalizing the role that heterosexual husbands and fathers have played. This is because when you divorce the natural leadership role of the husband from the relationship, you allow for the female to interpret the roles in marriage, parenting, and sexuality as she sees fit, or more appropriately, as she is<em> told</em> it should fit.</p>
<p>Most females are natural copycats, and possess conformist thinking rather than critical thinking. If this was not the case, Oprah and Dr. Oz would not hold the kind of hypnotic power over females that they financially enjoy today. Today’s elitist feminists (female <em>and</em> male) have learned to tap into that group-think power by indoctrinating other females into their ranks in order to get them to support this SJW cause or that one.</p>
<h4>2. Pro 31:3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</h4>

<p>What the bible (King Lemuel specifically) is saying here is pretty simple: don’t waste all your energies on the pursuit of females because they will bring about your ruin. Don’t become a beta man who orbits a female like a satellite does a planet.</p>

<p>How many modern day kings have had their downfall financially and otherwise, because they chose to spend too much effort on chasing tail? Gary Hart could be considered an example. His presidential candidacy was torpedoed because of his infidelities. While Bill Clinton proved that venery doesn’t necessarily prevent one from obtaining the presidency, he nonetheless endured much deserved humiliation for his philandering endeavors and he is still considered a joke even today. You are more than the sum of your reproductive parts, brother.</p>
<h4>
<strong>3. Isa 3:12</strong><strong> <em>As for</em> my people, children <em>are</em> their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause <em>thee</em> to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</strong>
</h4>
<div id="attachment_59550" style="width: 421px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-59550 " src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/j8055.jpg" alt="j8055" width="411" height="515" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/j8055.jpg 490w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/j8055-300x376.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/j8055-262x328.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 411px) 100vw, 411px"><p class="wp-caption-text">The most misunderstood man on earth</p>

<p>This one from Isaiah is pretty profound, and speaks volumes about how things were even back then. It seems that females have been in the business of trying to control men (through themselves and betas) for years. In addition, the modern day interpretation of “children are their oppressors” can easily apply to millennials and how they are led astray by feminist indoctrination in media and of course in social justice schools of so called higher thought.</p>
<p>Regrettably, these millennials end up furthering SJW causes as they advance in age and take up positions of power and influence, perpetuating the cycle of culture rot more and more. Furthermore, allowing a woman or beta male to hold a position of influence within society allows for anti-masculine teachings to become commonplace to the detriment of society as a whole.</p>
<p>“Destroying the way of thy paths” is therefore prophetic with regard to academic institutions, custody cases, and gender-based affirmative action initiatives which all have the common denominator of transforming females into the ersatz dominant sex.</p>
<div id="attachment_59547" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-59547 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hqdefault1.jpg" alt="hqdefault" width="480" height="360" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hqdefault1.jpg 480w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hqdefault1-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hqdefault1-262x197.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"><p class="wp-caption-text">The patron skank of modern feminists</p>
</div>
<p>The modern day feminist movement recognizes the red pill wisdom of the Bible as an unacceptable threat, which is why they’ve tried their best to discredit it as misogynistic, dismiss it as irrelevant, and sabotage it through the phenomena of feminized churches. Too many beta Christian males have been molded into religious feminists as a result of that last one.</p>
<p>Regardless of all these circumstances, the Bible is still considered the world’s most popular book and it will withstand social justice fads until the inevitable book burnings that come with a full-scale tyrannical takeover. Even an atheist red piller who frequents ROK or other sites on the manosphere can appreciate what the Bible is talking about here.</p>
