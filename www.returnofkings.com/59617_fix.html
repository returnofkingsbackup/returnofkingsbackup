<p>Return Of Kings readers are well-acquainted with the difficult predicament of wanting to settle down in western society. Though many men opt out of the marriage market, there are still a large number who desire a traditional marriage but do not know how to find it.</p>
<p>As has been written about extensively, dating foreign women who have not been exposed to our culture is one method of maximizing the chances of a more lasting partnership.</p>
<p>If you think it won’t happen to you, consider this: I too was a swinging bachelor for 12 years in Eastern Europe, and as I approached 40, I began to want just one good woman. I knew that if I waited too long, the quality of girls I could pull would slowly start to decline. Just ask the 50 and 60-year-olds trying unsuccessfully to find a 20-something Ukrainian wife.</p>
<p>To that end, here are four ways the right matchmaking service can help you to find a suitable partner if you desire to get married:</p>
<h3>1. By preparing you for the reality of dating a beautiful woman from a different culture</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Karina-square-close-up.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-60359" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Karina-square-close-up-300x314.jpg" alt="Karina square close up" width="300" height="314" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Karina-square-close-up-300x314.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Karina-square-close-up-667x699.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Karina-square-close-up-262x275.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Karina-square-close-up-574x602.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Karina-square-close-up.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Too many men think finding an Eastern European bride is nothing more than look, choose, point, click. It doesn’t work that way. A lot of men also believe their consistent lack of success with American or Western women will disappear when meeting ladies of the East.</p>
<p>The reality is that meeting, dating, and courting a beautiful Ukrainian or Russian lady can be even more challenging. If she speaks English, she’s probably successful in her career, has a high degree of intelligence (having two university degrees is common), and she is a truly feminine sexual creature.</p>
<p>She’ll expect you to act like a man, take the lead in all situations, be extremely confident (both in and out of the bedroom) and never display indecisiveness. Can you handle all that? If you can, then you will be truly rewarded.</p>
<h3>2. By offering a personal touch</h3>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/171wVy9OawY%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>One problem with large dating agencies is that they don’t care about verifying the ladies using their site. For them, more available female profiles equals more product on the shelves they can sell to masses of men. No one knows if the photos they post are truly them or not.</p>
<p>These women are never interviewed in person, as with a personal matchmaker, nor do they sign a contact, or show proof of identification and proof of having single marital status. The bottom line is that professional scammers, who have a significant presence on the big box agencies, will have a very difficult time ever registering with a reputable matchmaking agency. Most will not even bother to try.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Good matchmakers know their girl’s background, personal story, and romantic dreams inside and out. For the man it’s so much easier to ask this “friend” the really hard or potentially serious questions and get the honest answers.</p>
<h3>3. By giving you good value for your dollar spent</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-60361" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14-300x261.jpg" alt="1" width="300" height="261" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14-300x261.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14-837x728.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14-667x580.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14-262x228.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14-574x499.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/14.jpg 1115w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>A serious problem with big agencies, besides not producing results, is that they nickel and dime men to death. Some agencies charge for every single email or chat sent and received, some charge translation fees on top of that, and some push men to buy expensive “gifts” for the ladies like perfume, flowers, chocolate, or even English lessons, which we know is a bad precedent to set.</p>
<p>A good matchmaking agency will do one thing and one thing only, and that is connect a man with the most compatible women specific to him.</p>
<h3>4. By wearing many hats and doing more than just matching</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha_gArfhdwI&amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha_gArfhdwI&amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>
<p>Perhaps the absolute biggest advantage to using a matchmaker over the free social networks and dating sites is the mindset of the women you find. You see, the women who have joined a matchmaking agency have made a conscious and definitive life decision that they are READY for marriage.</p>
<p>This, as compared to the mindset of the others which is “hmm, I’ll put myself where everyone else is and just see what happens.”</p>
<p>A true matchmaker will get to know a whole lot about you first before helping select the women to contact. He or she is able to sit in on your video Skype dates, translate if necessary, and evaluate the progress being made. They’ll make suggestions along the way to steer things in the right direction.</p>
<p>Even if you opt to make calls or send emails in private, your matchmaker can do follow-up interviews with man and woman and read between the lines to understand if things are working. They can even quickly perform damage control if you inadvertently screw something small up that would otherwise end the relationship.</p>
<p>If things are not meant to be with a particular individual, the matchmaker will save you time and money by suggesting some changes in your conversations or to just move on to the next candidate.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Professional matchmaking agencies offer the kind of one to one service that those big online dating sites will never be able to offer. Many thousands of high achievers and professionals still prefer them over the on-line solution.</p>
<p>So if you consider yourself a high achieving man, or at least believe you deserve the same results in life as one, then bringing a beautiful foreign bride to your doorstep is certainly within reach in approximately a year or less. <strong><a href="http://www.bridesmadeinukraine.com?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Click here</a></strong> to find out more about our service and begin the process today.</p>
