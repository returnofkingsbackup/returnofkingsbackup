<p class="p1"><em>The following article was sponsored by <a href="http://boldanddetermined.net/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">BADNET</a></em></p>
<p class="p2">Ted Cruz, Hispanic-American and United States Senator, is one hell of a guy.</p>
<p class="p2">Known for his fierce resistance to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (also known as Obamacare), he has decided to run for President in the 2016 election.</p>
<p class="p2">Only one problem.</p>
<p class="p2">He doesn’t own his name.</p>
<p class="p2">Let’s take a step back in time. Way back in 2008 there was a lowly real estate agent who decided to take his destiny into his own hands. He bought <a href="http://www.tedcruz.com/"><span class="s1">www.tedcruz.com</span></a> and built this website:</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-12.01.21-PM.png.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-60213" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-12.01.21-PM.png-300x163.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2015-04-01 at 12.01.21 PM.png" width="416" height="226" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-12.01.21-PM.png-300x163.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-12.01.21-PM.png-262x143.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-12.01.21-PM.png-574x312.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Screen-Shot-2015-04-01-at-12.01.21-PM.png.jpg 588w" sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px"></a></p>
<p class="p2">Well, “real estate Ted Cruz” must have gone out of business, because after a few years his domain went dark. Then, sometime around the end of 2014 something interesting happened.</p>
<p class="p2">Some joker caught wind of Ted Cruz the Senator’s upcoming bid for President. And this joker did a very smart thing. He bought up <a href="http://www.tedcruz.com/"><span class="s1">www.tedcruz.com</span></a> and planted a pro-Obama message on it.</p>

<p class="p2">What can the real Ted Cruz do? Nothing. He is now helpless to control the conversation around him. You might think that page doesn’t get much traffic, but from where I’m looking, it’s firmly on the 2nd page of Google.</p>
<p class="p2">Plenty of voters tend to be older people. They didn’t grow up with the internet. And like it or not, they tend to add a .com automatically to whatever they’re looking for.</p>
<p class="p2">Say, something like “Ted Cruz .com.”</p>
<p class="p2">Nowadays politicians know that much of their fundraising and campaigning is done online. So what is Ted Cruz going to do? He’s going to ignore this problem as long as he can, and then he’s going to settle with the domain owner. For a hefty payout.</p>
<p class="p2">All because he made the mistake of not owning his name online.</p>
<p class="p2">This is not a dumb man either. Cruz graduated as valedictorian of his high school in Houston. He graduated cum laude from Princeton. He won the US National Speaker of the Year award and went on to compete in the 1995 World Universities Debating Championship.</p>
<p class="p2">He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and his professor claimed him to be, “off-the-charts brilliant.” But he was very obviously un-brilliant about managing his professional reputation online.</p>
<h3 class="p4"><b>Now what’s the lesson in here for you?</b></h3>
<p class="p2">You might not decide to be famous today. But what about tomorrow?</p>
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li5">Maybe you’ll want to own a brick-and-mortar business.</li>
<li class="li5">Maybe you’ll want your friends and family to easily get in touch with you.</li>
<li class="li5">Maybe you just want to safeguard yourself from bullies and domain squatters who can harm your reputation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">A smart man should own his name. If your domain’s still available (and nobody’s decided to take it yet), you can grab it for free from BADNET.</p>
<p class="p2">If your domain’s not available, you might have to pay for it out of pocket, but do what you can to get ahold of it. You never know how important it may be.</p>
<p class="p2">Ted Cruz can still buy this domain name if the website owner agrees. He certainly has the cash to do so. But can you afford that mistake?</p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Owning a domain name is cheap. <a href="http://boldanddetermined.net/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">You can grab one for free if you sign up for web hosting at BADNET.</a></span></p>
<p class="p2">But not owning one? That can do some damage.</p>
<p class="p2">Do you own your name?</p>
