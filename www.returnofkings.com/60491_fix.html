<p><em>The following article was originally published <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/how-foreign-women-view-western-men-for-relationships">on Roosh V</a>.</em></p>
<p>I hope I have debunked the fantasy that a man can fly into any foreign country <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-dirty-truth-about-traveling-to-meet-women">and easily find his dream girl</a> within a short amount of time. The reality is that meeting foreign women can be just as laborious as meeting women in your own country, and that’s not including the monetary cost of travel. The rewards are far greater, of course, but traveling to an unknown land to develop a sexual and emotional connection with a woman who shares a completely different culture than you is no easy task, and should not be viewed as such.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help our cause that foreign women view us as a less worthy long-term partner than a local man. You may be wondering how can that be, with countless stories of mail-order brides and international couples meeting on the internet, but there are several points to consider.</p>
<h4>A foreign girl in her prime can get top local guys</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-385" src="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/russian.jpg" alt="russian" width="402" height="604" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2012/10/russian.jpg 402w, wp-content/uploads/2012/10/russian-199x300.jpg 199w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px"></p>
<p>There is no need for a hot 21-year-old Russian girl to pursue a long-term relationship with an American man who doesn’t speak Russian, doesn’t have local connections, and doesn’t have any long-term roots instead of dating a high-value Russian man that she can easily get. Even in the poorest countries of the world, the most beautiful women have multiple strong options, and when you get into the 8 and 9 beauty range, you will find it quite challenging to maintain a relationship with her since she has so many high-value local men in her orbit.</p>
<p>Let’s do an example. Say that you studied Spanish in high school and later as an adult met a Colombian girl who moved to your city. She speaks no English. She is quite pretty, but not higher than what you can normally get. You begin dating her and appreciate her feminine qualities and exotic nature, but local girls above her beauty range still give you tons of attention, while the emotional connection with the Colombian is stunted because of not being able to communicate properly with her. How long will you date the Colombian for the novelty factor before easing back into your previous routine?</p>
<h4>Purely sexual relationships are easy to create but hard to maintain</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-58636" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Fotolia_34250249_Subscription_XL-e1426164980114.jpg" alt="Upset pair of lovers." width="500" height="242"></p>
<p>It’s not that difficult to have sex with a foreign girl who happens to be interested in foreign men. If she’s never met an American man before, and you approach her with good game, she may put out for you much faster than the local guy. This sexual experience will be very valuable to her, but then the reality of the situation will hit: a relationship with a foreign guy isn’t that great. He’s isolated from the local scene and probably doesn’t have a car or other badges of high value. He doesn’t have a local sense of humor, doesn’t share an interest in local movies and music, and doesn’t have much going on besides having a job, a fact that is less important since her standard of living is ever increasing.</p>
<p>Even worse, speaking in English all the time is tiring. A girl wants a relaxing or exciting relationship, not one where she has to exert her brain, and if the girl is pretty enough, she can get a guy on your level who not only is from her culture, but speaks the language and has more local “perks” that add weight to the relationship. Therefore it’s very rare that relationships in my experience last more than two months with a high-value young girl. She will fuck my brains out for that time and then move on to something more suitable for her needs.</p>
<h4>Lower value foreign girls are more willing to pursue relationships</h4>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<p>If I’m an 8 out of 10 in a foreign country and date a young girl who is also an 8, the relationship won’t last long. She’ll get tired or bored and move on to easily date a local guy. But the lower value a girl is (e.g. a 6), the more likely she will try to lock me down. The reason for this is simple: she can not get a local guy in the 8 range, so I am the best she’s ever likely to get. The fact that I’m not local is a lower concern than the fact that I’m the highest value she can land based on her lower beauty level.</p>
<p>If you have low or modest standards, establishing a relationship with foreign girls can be quite easy and pleasurable. She will see you as a long-term partner and not get bored after a month or two. She won’t stray or give you bullshit. She may even start to increase her English studies to prepare for a lifelong partnership with you. Let that sink in for a second: she’s ready to throw her own language and culture under the bus to be with a man who is the highest in value she’s been able to get.</p>
<h4>Slightly older women have given up on local men</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-37498" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/06/spinsters.jpg" alt="spinsters" width="550" height="366"></p>
<p>Another potential avenue in your search are women <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/my-experimentation-with-older-european-women">who are 25 and older</a>. If a woman in a place like Eastern Europe or South America is single at this age, she is becoming desperate for a man and wants to secure the highest value she can. Even if she was a 9 in her youth, she will now be accessible to the foreign man for a long-term relationship, simply because she has failed with the local men due to being deficient in some way.</p>
<p>The 8 or 9 who wouldn’t want a relationship with you when she was 21 and getting tons of attention from local men will now strongly consider marrying you at 28 when all that attention has dried up and you are her best option (does that strategy sound familiar to you?). Unfortunately for me, I do not enjoy the company of women over 25, so I try to limit my dealings with them, but this would be a target pool to select from especially since they’re done fucking around and desperately want to start a family. As long as you don’t mind being cock number twenty while having to wait for sex much longer than the sexy Spanish man she met during her last trip to Majorca, she’s all yours.</p>
<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p>When it comes to my dealings with foreign women, I follow this prescription:</p>
<p><em>If a girl is high value (young and very beautiful), extract as many instances of sex from her as possible and enjoy the ride.</em></p>
<p>The reason is because I know I won’t be able to hold onto her for more than a couple months before she starts to crave a local guy. If she wants to try to lock me down, she can, and I wouldn’t mind a <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-rise-of-the-mini-relationship">mini-relationship with her</a>, but she has so many options from a respectful local pool that I am satisfied at only having the short-term sexual rewards, especially at my advanced age.</p>
<p>If a girl is merely cute or pretty, I could pursue a relationship knowing that I could definitely fuck better, but possibly not maintain a relationship with better, simply due to the fact that my value as a foreign guy has limitations that aren’t an issue in my home country.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s important to be realistic. Just like how I’ve stated that getting foreign women can entail a lot of work, we have to also understand that we won’t be able to easily wife up the best of what any country has to offer. I’m not upset at this for two reasons: (1) I’m not willing to put the additional work in raising my local value to keep the highest quality girls, and (2) The quality I’m able to get for medium-term relationships is solid even if it’s not the absolute top, and going higher would not bring me a large increase in happiness or satisfaction due to passing the point of diminishing return.</p>
<p>If there’s anything I’ve learned through living abroad for over five years, it’s that beautiful women everywhere—even in dirt poor countries—have options. They don’t have the immediate need to throw themselves on a sexy Westerner who has a marginal backstory that doesn’t include permanent local roots. But thankfully, foreign women are almost always better than American women, so I’m definitely not losing any sleep at the problems that my international pursuits contain.</p>
