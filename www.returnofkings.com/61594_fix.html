<p class="p1">Damn man, the job market is hard.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You’ve got to contend with hordes of losers applying for the same job as you. </span>You’ve got to wait long weeks just to hear back, “Sorry, we’re not interested.” You’ve got to deal with a boss who treats you like a fool even though you’re much smarter than him.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">What if there were a better way? A way to get paid a real salary and not simply eat dirt for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? </span>You’re smart, you already know the answer is, “Yes, a way <i>does</i> exist.” It’s called building a business, and dumber people than you are doing it every day.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you work for a boss, you’re not going to make good money. </span><b>That’s because unless your labor makes them more money than they pay you they’d be foolish to hire you.</b> This is true of every single position anywhere. From scraping toilets to C-level executives. You’ll never get paid what you’re worth…</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Unless you become an entrepreneur. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">When you’re an entrepreneur, you know for a fact that three things are true. </span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>1. You can work as much as you want</b></span></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/blue-collar-worker.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-23616" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/blue-collar-worker.jpg" alt="blue collar worker" width="387" height="225"></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You want to work more hours to bring in business faster? Go ahead. </span>Try suggesting overtime to your boss at work and it’s more likely you’ll get turned down. He doesn’t want to pay a premium for you.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Or how about if you’d like to work <i>less hours</i> and reserve more time for yourself to go to the gym, prepare meals, or read great books? </span>See how well that goes down. Tell your boss, “I want to work less hours and get paid less.”</p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Most likely you’ll see yourself working <b>zero</b> hours in a hurry. </span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>2. You can work as smart as you want</b></span></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/06/artificial-intelligence-running-the-world.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37157" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/06/artificial-intelligence-running-the-world.jpg" alt="Artificial intelligence running the world" width="450" height="300"></a></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">If you are smart, you’ll begin to see holes in every business around you. </span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Maybe their marketing sucks and nobody’s coming in through the door. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Maybe their product is terrible and you know a way to make it more appealing. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">Maybe their logistics are bad and you can see ways to speed up the supply chain. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">A critical eye turned to any business will show thousands of tiny improvements that you can make. </span>But let’s say you suggest a few of these ideas to your boss. The business sees a 25% bump in revenue.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Do you see any of that increase? </span>NO. At best, you see a tiny token bonus as a thank you. Not nearly as much as you actually <i>earned</i> for them.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But how about if the result of your efforts to improve and tweak a business <i>directly resulted in more cash in your pocket? </i></span>That would be nicer, yeah? All you need is to offer something valuable.</p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">When you own a business, <i>you</i> call all the shots. You’re the big kahuna. You’re the guy everyone looks up to. </span>And that means that everything is up to you.</p>
<ul>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">The look, up to you. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">The product, up to you. </span></li>
<li class="li3"><span class="s1">The voice, up to you. </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">This is a powerful feeling. One of the best feelings about working for yourself is that of being a self-determined man, all day, every day. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In fact, self-determination correlates with overall happiness. When you work for yourself, you aren’t being told what to do, <b>you decide what to do</b>, which leads to greater fulfillment. </span></p>
<h3 class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>4. (Optional) You can work wherever you want</b></span></h3>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Most businesses require inventory. They require your presence managing employees. And they require renting a space to sell from. </span>But my favorite kind of business allows you to make deals from anywhere.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You don’t need inventory to start an online business. And you don’t need anywhere besides your kitchen table to run it from. Powerful software tools exist that let you manage a team of employees doing all your dirty work for you, wherever you are in the world. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">From stocking warehouses, to delivering seminars, to running your customer service, getting things done through your computer has never been easier or cheaper. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">But they all require a home base – your website. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">The best way to get started is with a powerful website platform such as WordPress. WordPress is free software that makes it easy for anyone to build a website and get it looking exactly how you want. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">More than 23% of all the websites on the internet run with a backbone of WordPress, so you know you’re in good hands. </span>But you don’t need to know the tech to get started. In fact, we’ll even install WordPress for you, so you can get started building right away.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s3"><a href="http://badnet.com?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Just head over to BADNET, get yourself a free domain, and get started.</a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">You’ll get a professionally set up website ready for you to use as your canvas. Make art, start a business, get paid. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">And start making what you’re really worth.</span></p>
