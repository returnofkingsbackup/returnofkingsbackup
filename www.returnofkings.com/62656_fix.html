<p>Hey man,</p>
<p>Mike Chang here. Being the #1 subscribed trainer on YouTube has it’s rewards and responsibilities. And one of the most rewarding things that I do is getting to meet and help awesome people from all around the world get in shape..</p>
<p>You know… by helping them to pack on lean ripped muscle as fast as possible!</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-29_1812.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-62658" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-29_1812-300x164.png" alt="2015-04-29_1812" width="423" height="231" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-29_1812-300x164.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-29_1812-262x143.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-29_1812-574x313.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04-29_1812.png 621w" sizes="(max-width: 423px) 100vw, 423px"></a></p>
<p>And that’s actually me getting a chance to show Steve Harvey and his fans my little shortcut for doing just that.</p>
<p>It was an awesome experience to help so many people, and Steve himself. But one thing I didn’t get to do on that show was tell the world why I started working out.</p>
<p>We all have our reasons why… yours might be just to drop some weight for an event or get the attention of a girl. Or maybe something you’ve experienced has caused you to want to make a change within yourself. Well, for me…</p>
<p>I grew up in a pretty rough part of Houston, Texas and I dealt with a lot of bullies growing up. So yeah, I needed to put on muscle and be lean and athletic to survive. Or so I thought when I was young… However, I now know that having a ripped, muscular body is more about me getting the confidence and attention I deserve… not about me protecting myself.</p>

<p>The truth is that I didn’t have THIS when I was first starting to build the body I have today. But I guarantee you that if I did, my results would have come way faster. What am I talking about? The fat shedding and muscle building power of high levels of testosterone.</p>
<p>So today I’m going to give you the 3​best tips to boosting your testosterone​ that you can start using today.</p>
<h3>1. Eat more of the RIGHT types of fat</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61946" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-300x214.jpg" alt="perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442" width="300" height="214" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-300x214.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-262x187.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-574x409.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>To a lot of guys, eating more fat might sound a bit crazy. However these guys don’t know that eating more fat, specifically unsaturated fat, actually helps boost your testosterone.</p>
<p>And some types of fats, such as polyunsaturated fat, can actually help your body to carry crucial muscle building nutrients and hormones to your muscles quickly. So these good types of fats will help you maximize your results… especially after a hard workout.</p>
<p>Now this doesn’t mean you should start going on a fried chicken diet. Remember, in order to get your testosterone levels up ­ you’ve got to eat the r​ight fats.</p>
<p>Here are a few delicious foods that are high in good fats that can help you increase your test levels rapidly.</p>

<ul>
<li>­ Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel and trout are full of omega­-3 fatty acids, the good fats. It’s recommended that you eat at least two servings of fatty fish like these every week to maintain a good level of omega 3s in your system.</li>
<li>­Another great source of fats is olive oil or coconut oil. Whether it’s used as a dressing or to cook with, it’s a great way to consume more of good fats you need.</li>
<li>­Lastly, foods like nu​ts, eggs and especially avocado, are very rich in unsaturated fats. These foods make for a great healthy snack, and they also help you fulfill your muscle building protein needs.So make sure to include one of these fat sources in your next meal, and enjoy the test boosting benefits they bring.</li>

<h3>2. Cut out cardio!</h3>

<p>It’s almost like an infectious disease that’s going around our society that’s affecting a ton of guys looking to get in shape… it’s called “Chronic Cardio Syndrome.” And guys who have it are wasting their workouts by doing long cardio sessions hoping to shed away unwanted fat.</p>
<p>Not only is long, slow cardio the worst way to burn fat, it’s also killing your muscle mass by destroying your body’s testosterone production.</p>
<p>And with your testosterone levels way down, you’ll be at an increased risk for a number of health issues such as depression, muscle loss, erectile dysfunction, heart complications, and fat gain,­ particularly around the stomach area.</p>
<p>So here’s the bottom line:​ avoid doing long cardio sessions on the treadmill, elliptical, and the stationary bike because you could be seriously damaging your testosterone. Instead, focus on using compound exercises like squats or deadlifts.</p>
<p>Squats actually boost your testosterone!</p>

<h3>3. Avoid common things like BOTTLED WATER that KILL your testosterone</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/04/water-gaza-israel.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-8616" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/04/water-gaza-israel.jpg" alt="water-gaza-israel" width="396" height="246"></a></p>
<p>I know this sounds crazy, but even something as simple as bottled waters can be a major testosterone killer. And that’s because when you drink them, you could be pumping female hormones right into your body. But it doesn’t stop with bottles of water… there are a number of things, just like this, that you are using everyday that are feminizing your body as we speak.</p>
<p>However, here’s what’s wrong with bottled water. The plastic that it’s made from contains chemicals that are putting more estrogen into your body every time you drink it.</p>
<p>And if you didn’t know, estrogen is what makes a woman… well, a woman. On top of that, when a man gets too much estrogen, it can cause some unpleasant side effects, such as muscle loss, man boobs and extra fat storage.</p>
<p>I actually just made a new presentation that covers all of the common things you need to avoid if you want to boost your testosterone: <a href="http://sixpackshortcuts.com/rdZN?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">n​aturally boost your testosterone</a>.</p>
