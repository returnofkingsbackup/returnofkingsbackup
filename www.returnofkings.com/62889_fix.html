<p>Guys first getting into game can be forgiven for chasing anything in a skirt. Not only does sexual frustration make this a necessity, but it’s also a pretty good strategy. After all, how frequently do game writers recommend that you get out there and hit on as many girls as possible? The more prospects you have on the go, the more likely it is that one of them will come off, resulting in a lay.</p>
<p>But as you get more used to interacting with women, you will find that there are different identifiable “types” of girls and some you should avoid like the plague. A particularly heinous breed is one I’m calling the “Holly Golightly girl” after Truman Capote’s <em>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</em> (and the Audrey Hepburn movie of the same name).</p>
<p>Holly Golightly girls are frequently hot, but they are also vacuous, annoying, and entitled. More importantly, they are prick teases and rarely put out. As such, you should make it your business to steer clear of them.</p>
<h3><strong>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</strong></h3>

<p>Those who have read Capote’s novella (of which even literary alpha Norman Mailer was a big fan) or seen the movie will recall Holly Golightly, the iconic central character, a small-town girl who moves to New York City. Without a job and living in a small apartment, she nevertheless manages to live the high life through the patronage of rich men.</p>
<p>In the movie version she develops a relationship of sorts with Paul (George Peppard), a struggling writer, before dumping him unceremoniously for Jose, a Brazilian artistocrat. To satisfy the requirements of what was essentially a prototype Hollywood romcom, Holly finally comes back to Paul after he’s convinced her, beta-style, that she’s afraid of commitment and should settle down with a “good man.”</p>
<p>The ending of the novella is darker. Holly continues to drift, squandering her pre-wall years before winding up in Argentina. An interview Capote gave with <em>Playboy</em> in 1968 illuminates her character:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Playboy</em></strong>: Would you elaborate on your comment that Holly was the prototype of today’s liberated female and representative of a whole breed of girls who live off men but are not prostitutes, they’re our version of the geisha girl.</p>
<p><strong>Capote</strong>: Holly Golightly was not precisely a call girl. She had no job, but accompanied expense-account men to the best restaurants and night clubs, with the understanding that her escort was obligated to give her some sort of gift, perhaps jewelry or a check …if she felt like it, she might take her escort home for the night. So these girls are the authentic American geishas, and they’re much more prevalent now than in 1943 or 1944, which was Holly’s era.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fast-forward to 2015 and such girls are even more common than in the 1940s. Of course, we frequently hear stories about women heading to L.A. in the hope of becoming movie stars and singers, but actually I think the phenomenon extends out to a great many international cities, in particular New York and London, where I live.</p>
<p>Girls with a surfeit of physical attractiveness but little in the way of intelligence, professional skills, or talent are drawn to these metropolitan hubs with the rather hazy plan of “making it.” Invariably, this either results in marriage to some rich sucker, or crack-whore oblivion. But in the meantime, it involves callously screwing over a great many inexperienced guys, which is why you must be on your guard.</p>
<h3>How to spot a Holly Golightly girl</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audrey-colour.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-62892" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audrey-colour-300x374.jpg" alt="Audrey colour" width="336" height="418" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audrey-colour-300x374.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audrey-colour-262x326.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Audrey-colour.jpg 537w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px"></a></p>
<p>The first thing to note is that Holy Golightly girls are frequently very hot. This makes sense – after all, they have to have some form of sexual capital on which to trade in the first place, otherwise their big city project would be doomed before they started. They tend to be quite bohemian (hipster, rock chick, or high-end glamorous are the most common styles) and slightly dreamy. When you come into contact with one you will always – rightly – feel that her attention is not entirely focused on you, even when you are in deep conversation.</p>

<p>Holly Golightly girls are by definition not indigenous, but have moved from a smaller place to the city. There will be a lot of talk on their Facebook walls about their exciting “journey,” “adventure,” and the next step in their “story.” Holly Golightly girls are convinced that they are living their own movie, and that it is as fascinating to everyone else as it is to them. Unfortunately the advent of social media means that they can share each installment with their (inevitable) band of thirsty followers.</p>
<p>There is likely to be some form of financial backing in place at the time that they move – either from parents or from male “friends” (Holly Golightly girls rarely if ever have boyfriends – after all, that would tie them down to a single option in a city full of them). Cash flow means that they have the luxury of being extremely exacting about the kind of work that they take on.</p>
<p>Whereas many of the immigrants that arrive in London have little choice but to take the first job on offer – if they’re lucky as a barista at Pret a Manger or one of the other big coffee chains, and if they’re less lucky cleaning toilets or worse – Holly Golightly girls can take their time. They almost always have an unrealistic aspiration to work in an artistic, glamorous industry that pays a few at the top highly and is a closed-shop for almost everyone else – acting, modeling, fashion design or photography and so on.</p>
<p>On daddy’s dollar they can afford to relax, attending auditions that lead nowhere, or undertaking internships that don’t yield anything permanent. They may also have a fledgling, but ultimately worthless singing career driven by social media likes, or a beauty blog, or other similar vanity project.</p>
<p>While their lackadaisical job search is going on, Holly Golightly girls are to be found most nights at the fanciest clubs, bars, restaurants, fashion shows and gallery openings that the city has to offer. Frequently they will be in the company of some (very good-looking) male friend or other. Everyone in this world is a “friend” – whether actual sex is going down or not is difficult to discern for the outsider, although if it benefits Holly then you can safely bet that it is.</p>
<p>This glittering social life belies a tawdrier domestic situation. If you make it back to Holly’s place, you will find that her bedroom is a bombsite, with designer clothes and make-up strewn all over the floor, dirty plates in the sink, and a dustbin creaking beneath the weight of many, many empty wine bottles. There will most likely be used spliffs in the ashtray and reality TV on loop on her MacBook air.</p>

<h3><strong>Dating Holly Golightly</strong></h3>
<p>The best advice is to go out of your way to avoid dating Holly Golightly girls. Even more than regular girls, they have an agenda and the chances are you don’t fit in with it.</p>
<p>Holly Golightly girls are uniformly scatty and flaky. They are prone to turning up for dates incredibly late, or “forgetting” them entirely. Worse, they can throw in curveballs. When you meet she might insist that you come along to a party of a friend of hers – that party being held by some buff, rich dude who she then proceeds to monopolize all night at your expense.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated, the Holly Golightly girl may appear scatty: in fact, she is playing a difficult game that requires adaptability and eagle-eyed cunning. Rather like real-time trading on the financial markets, the Holly Golightly girl is constantly eying up her prospects, angling for whomever is going to help her gain a better position in the city’s social firmament.</p>
<p>Basically, this is supercharged hypergamy. If she misses your date then she’s not forgetful – she’s simply found a prospect that in her estimation will get her to her goal faster than you will. Obviously, this is why Holly rejects Paul for Jose in the movie.</p>
<p>All women are hypergamous to some extent, but it is the Holly Golightly girl’s raison d’etre. It is telling –and slightly depressing — that Audrey Hepburn remains such an icon for young women today, who have everything from tote bags to mugs to t-shirts bearing her Tiffany’s-era image.</p>
<p>For your own sake, if you come across Holly then you are well-advised either to make it a short term engagement, or steer clear altogether and watch the wreckage from a safe distance instead.</p>
