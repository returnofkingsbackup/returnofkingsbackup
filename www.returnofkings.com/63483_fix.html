<p>“Mommy, I want to play ball with the boys”, said six-year-old Annie, in a tone of voice that was rapidly approaching the dreaded high-pitched whine. “You will, my dear, I will make them”, said her weight-challenged mom as she turned towards the pair of laughing teenage boys that were throwing a ball back and forth in the nearby cul-de-sac.</p>
<p>“NICKY! DANIEL! Annie wants to play ball with you! You better play with her and behave, otherwise I swear to God, I will tell your mothers!” bellowed the mother hen at the boys.</p>

<p>As soon as Annie joined the game, the boys’ behavior changed dramatically. They were expected to accept Annie as their equal, which she obviously wasn’t. The ball was no longer thrown or punted with any considerable force, lest little Annie trip herself up and kiss the ground.</p>
<p>Instead, the ball was passed along or gently rolled on the ground. Meanwhile, the mother hen perched herself high on the balcony overlooking the neighborhood, seated on what must have been a titanium-reinforced chair, and occasionally shouted orders.</p>

<p>The first thing Annie did was make sure nobody possessed the ball—everyone had to have exactly equal time with it, and in a specific order. The purpose of this forced sharing was so that nobody had their feelings hurt in any way by being left out. The game was no longer about competition, it was about participation.</p>
<p>Of course, boys grew tired of her rules immediately but still went along with the charade because it seemed like the path of least resistance.</p>
<h3>What is going on here?</h3>
<p>If you’ve spent any amount of time in a Western country, you must have seen something like this unfold right in front of your eyes. You might have been involved in such occurrences and yielded to women without thinking twice. Besides, it can seem so natural when you’re immersed in a gynocentric culture on a daily basis. Women are people too, right? Why not treat them with the same respect men get?</p>

</div>
<p>The problem is that women lack accountability and will always superimpose their inner realities upon the outside world, rather than the other way around. Ignoring objective reality usually comes at a great price, but women offload the cost onto unsuspecting men, dragging them down into the darkness.</p>
<p>If a woman was given free reign over the Garden of Eden, she would ruin it for everyone. Want proof? Allow me to go biblical for just a second and quote <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A13&amp;version=NIV">Genesis 3:13</a> :</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rok-serpent-deceived-me-cropped-and-resized-2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-63505" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rok-serpent-deceived-me-cropped-and-resized-2.jpg" alt="rok serpent deceived me cropped and resized 2" width="500" height="68" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rok-serpent-deceived-me-cropped-and-resized-2.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rok-serpent-deceived-me-cropped-and-resized-2-300x41.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rok-serpent-deceived-me-cropped-and-resized-2-262x36.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>
<p>Note the deflection of responsibility – the woman hasn’t done anything wrong, it’s the snake’s fault for presenting her with a temptation she couldn’t resist. Now, the Bible shouldn’t be taken literally, but the fact that a <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/how-old-is-the-Bible.html">3,400 year old</a> book talks so frankly about the true nature of women is astounding.</p>
<p>In fact, everything else in the Bible pales in comparison to that one verse and is pretty much tainted by a needless religious subtext. That one sentence is a warning from ages past—anything can be destroyed by putting a woman in charge and letting her have an “oopsie” moment.</p>
<p>So, how does this translate to our times? The root of all problems with women is that they are entitled, which means they want respect and attention they don’t deserve. Girls are carefully groomed from the early childhood to believe themselves to be perfect. When left unchallenged, this attitude eventually turns them into a black hole wherein all resources and attention disappear.</p>
<p>A boy who tries to do the same thing as Annie would be rightfully called “spoiled” and quickly humbled by his friends or his brother, if he has them.</p>
<p>It is your duty to call out female entitlement when you see it and spread awareness of this phenomenon, sharing your insights alongside it. Humbling a woman will generally cause a wave of triggering to occur among perennially butthurt SJWs, but it is the only way to stop females from being a liability, not just on you, but on the entire society.</p>
<p>If a woman still refuses to change her ways, don’t give her your respect or attention and simply move on.</p>
