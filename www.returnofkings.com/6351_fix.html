<p class="cb-author-bio">Edward was a weekly contributor at Return of Kings until he passed away unexpectedly after being crushed to death under the weight of his own massive ego. Tall, devastatingly handsome, witty, and successful; the poor lad just couldn’t handle the supreme awesomeness of his own being. May he rest in peace.</p>

<p>Judging by the red pill comments, the article “<i><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larissafaw/2012/12/05/why-are-so-many-professional-millennial-women-unable-to-find-dateable-men/" target="_blank">Why Are So Many Professional Millennial Women Unable To Find Dateable Men?</a></i>” has already made the rounds in the manosphere.  I’ll give props to the author, Larissa Faw, for managing to keep it as real as her little hamster could in some portions. Here’s a sample that shows a wee bit of clarity:</p>
<blockquote><p>But now, [after focusing on becoming a career girl] a growing number of Millennial women are beginning to fret over the unanticipated consequences of prioritizing our careers before love. And I only need to look at my group of friends to see this reality. Again and again, year after year, my successful, gorgeous, and amazing friends remain kiss-less on New Year’s Eve. And on Valentine’s Day. And on the 4th of July.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m usually the first person to laugh my ass off when these types of women take a salty load of reality to the face, but I’m in a good mood today. If we would all lower our shields and sheathe our swords for a moment, we may be able to acknowledge that many women today were not prepared by their parents or society for the consequences of their actions. That doesn’t make it right, which is why there are still consequences, but a growing number of 20 and 30-something women have been taught to ignore biology since the day they were born; assured by those they trusted most that there would be little or no penalties for their actions.</p>
<p>Internally, my heart goes out to them. But externally, only my dick goes out to them because I didn’t create the problem and I have no moral or ethical obligation to solve it.</p>
<p>Moving on. I came across a response to this article that I wanted to use as a springboard for a different topic. After the author listed fancy clothes and cool apartment décor as a sign of success, and after everyone called her out for amassing debt and urged her to get a grip on reality, Arrow Night commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Slightly edited for clarity] They have to keep paying, and they have to keep spending because if they lose the house and the car, or fail to keep up with the latest fashions, they “fall into shadow” – and they won’t be as attractive as their friends/worst-hated-competitors (same people). And when the “Retard Millionaire” finally shows up, they fear their friends will get rescued instead of them because they “looked” nicer to him as a “package”. This is all in women’s minds, mind you. Even a “Retard Millionaire” wants a young, hot girl.</p></blockquote>
<p>This. Bravo, my good sir.</p>
<p>Women who are more concerned with their GRE score than their FICO score give me a runny case of the lulz. Time and time again I meet women who make half my salary, and in every single instance without exception, these women live far better than I do. They have a closet full of top-brand clothes, they have a decked out apartment on a higher floor, they roll in BMWs and Mercedes, they spend $200 per month or more on hair and nails, and they have all the latest mobile gadgets.</p>
<p>I waited until I had a job with tuition reimbursement before I went to grad school. My out-of-pocket expenses for my entire graduate degree including books was just under $6k. My last girlfriend still owes Emory University nearly $97k for a degree in Cognition &amp; Development. I don’t even know what the hell that is. Emory is expensive, but I have to assume a large portion of that $97k was for living expenses.</p>
<p>Twice per month, I go to <a href="http://off5th.com/CN/Channelnet.cnsp?cn=sitebuilder&amp;act=view&amp;crt=sitekey=3%26pagekey=20430" target="_blank">Saks Off 5th</a> and <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/c/about-rack" target="_blank">Nordstrom Rack</a> and look for suits. When I find one made by a high-end clothier discounted to under $200, I pick it up and have a Laotian chick tailor it for $17. Most of my trips are in vain because shit is expensive, but over the years, I’ve put together a collection of tailored threads with timeless style – paid for in cash. My last girlfriend would model outfits for me, and when I said “you look amazing” she’d say “I should – you’re looking at $900 not counting the purse and shoes.”</p>

<p>I cook at home five days per week, and take leftovers to work for lunch. I go out for brunch at my favorite hole-in-the-wall place and then splurge a little for dinner on Saturday. I juice all day Sunday. I haven’t had a bar tab since Christmas (I’ve grown weary of bars and clubs) and if you see me with a drink in my hand, rest assured my company or a client is paying for it. This is one place where my last girlfriend has me beat, because I don’t think she has ever paid for a drink or a meal in her life.</p>
<p>I owe $19k to General Motors for a car I could sell to a dealer for $26k and to a private individual for $29k. My last girlfriend put $2,999 plus fees down on a Land Rover lease that she had to pay $535 per month for. We live in a concrete jungle where it takes over an hour to get to the mountains, and you can’t park that damn thing anywhere. I sure looked good in it though. Heh.</p>
<p>I have a corporate American Express card for travel that my company pays, and a Discover Card that I use for every purchase that I can so I’ll earn Amazon.com dollars (tip: those points add up fast – highly recommended). On the 1st of every month, my Discover Card balance is $0. My last girlfriend had two Visa cards and who knows how many department store cards that, according to her, added up to “only around $11k last time I [she] checked.”</p>
<p>My last girlfriend does not a trend make; however, we all know and work with dozens of young women like this. What man in his right freaking mind would marry that much debt?  Do you have any idea how many top-shelf hookers or young gold-digging slutty college students you could buy, or how many trips you could take, or how many worthy causes you could support with the amount of cash it would take to just pay off the modern woman’s unsecured debt?</p>
<p>Commenter Arrow Night was absolutely right. These women are looking for the retarded millionaire to come along and rescue them from themselves. They want to cash out around the age of 30, pop out a few kids, work less or quit working altogether, and find a man to pick up the tab.</p>
<p>That’s why they want their “equal” and that’s why they have such high standards. Never mind that their true equal would be so far in debt he couldn’t pay his own bills let alone hers, and never mind that their standards are based on a Disney cartoon shown to them over and over by the same parents who led them down the wrong path to begin with.</p>
<p>In the interest of fairness, I understand this phenomenon can’t only be assigned to women. Research shows that men tend to spend more and go into debt when they’re trying to attract a mate too:</p>
<blockquote><p>Consider the case of Macon and Columbus, two Georgia cities located within 100 miles of each other. In Columbus, there are 1.18 single men for every single woman, while in Macon, there are 0.78 single men for every single woman. As it happens, the average consumer debt in Columbus is $3,479 higher, per capita, than it is in Macon. […] When shown images with many more men than women, men in the study were willing to reduce their savings by 42 percent, and were willing to assume 84 percent more debt. “When men see more men than women in these photograph arrays, they become more likely to want to spend money more quickly, even to the point of going into debt.”</p></blockquote>

<p>But I don’t date men, so I don’t really care what they do with their money. The bottom line is that all these “gorgeous and amazing women” the author writes about are a massive liability to the very men they seek to procure. “Why Are So Many Professional Millennial Women Unable To Find Dateable Men?”</p>
<p>Because we’re avoiding them for a list of reasons that continues to grow every day.</p>
