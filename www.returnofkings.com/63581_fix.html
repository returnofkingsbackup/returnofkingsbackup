<p>Ok. You got screwed by a bad degree. <span class="s1">And you’ve heard it from everywhere by now.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">“Your degree sucks!” </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">“Go back and get a real degree!” </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">“You’ll never make as much as a doctor!” </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You know you’re destined for more than flipping burgers or rotating tires. You’ve got success written all over you. You’ve got to turn those classroom skills into some real dollars. </span><span class="s1">But how? </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The answer, my friend is easy. It’s as simple as finding a need, and filling it. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Case 1: The Music Major</b></span></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/music-in-verona.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-63582" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/music-in-verona-300x217.jpg" alt="music-in-verona" width="300" height="217" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/music-in-verona-300x217.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/music-in-verona-262x190.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/music-in-verona.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Let’s take a professionally trained singer. </span><span class="s1">Rather than spend all your life waiting tables, how about taking the skill you’ve honed over the years and turn it into some cash? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Oh,” you say, “Nobody wants to learn how to sing opera.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s fine though. Not many people want to sing opera. But opera is not all you can do. In fact, you have a very useful talent that’s not only in demand, but well-paid. </span><span class="s1">That is <b>vocal enhancement.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Instead of selling, “learn how to sing opera,” which nobody wants, you could instead offer a very <i>targeted</i> service that improves a specific domain. Something that gives a result within <b>one session</b> and creates a tangible change in the buyer. </span><span class="s1">How about something like, “Make your voice low, growly, and manly within minutes.” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Plenty of guys out there I know are insecure about their voices and would like to have a more classically manly voice. </span><span class="s1">Or how about something like, “Got an upcoming speech to deliver? Vocal confidence for public speaking within one session.” </span><span class="s1">You’ve just turned your “useless” skill into a business with a functional benefit to thousands of people. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Case 2: The Biology Major</b></span></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dna-biology1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-63583" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dna-biology1-300x142.jpg" alt="dna-biology1" width="387" height="183" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dna-biology1-300x142.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dna-biology1-262x124.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dna-biology1.jpg 478w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px"></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Biology may seem like a pretty strange field to profit from. You’ve got to have a lab and grant money to do anything real with that knowledge, don’t you? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No, you do not. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Better still, biological knowledge meets a fundamental human need (that’s often left out of Maslow’s hierarchy). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>The need to connect with nature.</i> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So who is it that most needs to connect with nature? Maybe city dwellers who work round the clock? </span><span class="s1">So here’s an idea: custom-designed plant and flower arrangements for city highrises. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You get contracts with the movers and shakers (who are rarely in their condos,) and design plant arrangements that not only <i>fit their space and personality</i>, but that have <i>functional benefits</i> as well. </span><span class="s1">Ever been in a polluted metropolitan area, and then escaped to the countryside? You know what a difference it makes to your lungs. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you can not only sell the <b>personalized to your space</b> angle, but also the <b>improve your health</b> angle. </span></p>

</div>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For instance, you might include a few <i>Sansevieria trifasciata</i>, or “mother-in-law’s tongue” plants – one of the best plants for small spaces because it rejuvenates the air and cleans it of toxins. </span><span class="s1">You get one of these contracts, and they’ll start to talk to their friends about that smart young lad who made their air cleaner, and their apartment look like a real urban jungle. </span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">What’s more, you could even sell ongoing contracts and hire out labor to your favorite immigrants to take care of the watering and maintenance while you go sell more. </span></p>
<h3 class="p3"><span class="s1"><b>Case 3: The History Major</b></span></h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By now you’re beginning to see that your degree doesn’t necessarily give you the direct skills required to build a business, but it can give you an <i>interesting angle.</i> </span><span class="s1">Now we’ll go to the last example, a history major. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If this is you, you may think you have <i>no</i> useful skills. But that’s far from the truth. In fact you have one very useful skill. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>You have the ability to take lots of information (often from conflicting sources) and turn it into something clear and concise.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s all writing an essay is.  </span><span class="s1">So what’s a field that’s rife with conflicting (and confusing) advice? </span><span class="s1">Well how about <i>nutrition</i>? </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sure, you could start an everyday nutrition blog. That would use your writing skills, but let’s say you wanted to put a <i>historical slant</i> on it. You could explore topics like “Recipes Your Great-Grandmother Made (That Were Healthier Than Anything Today)” </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Could do <i>very</i> well with certain audiences, (such as most of the women cooking in the world). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>They want to respect their heritage. You want to make some dough.</b> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you start digging up ancient recipe books. </span><span class="s1">There are a ton of these old cookbooks available if you peek around for them, but they often need to be translated for modern times. </span><span class="s1">They might call for <i>huge quantities</i> (designed for feeding an army, or a large family). They might require ingredients that are hard to find nowadays (elk liver). Or they might use cooking methods that would seem crude compared to modern methods (such as fermentation in urine… really). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So you write them up for modern times, explaining the nutritional benefits of using ancient methods and ingredients, while offering them in easy-to-use recipes. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">That’s easily a 5-figure business right there. </span><span class="s1">Combine the “heritage” angle with your powerful writing skills, and this could be a very profitable business. </span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><b><i>Best of all, these are all untapped. </i></b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No one has really cornered the market on these niches. In fact, people are just beginning to dig in to some of these more profitable angles. </span><span class="s1">That could be you. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But one thing’s for sure, if you don’t go ahead and get yourself set up with a domain name and a website soon, it might be too late to make these (or other businesses). </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://badnet.com?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><b>To get started with a free domain name and a website on the world’s most powerful open-source software, head over to BADNET.</b> </a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It’s a free service where we set you up with a ready-to-use website within 48 hours. You just pay hosting. </span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s3"><a href="http://badnet.com?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">That’s less than $5/month to run a real business. </a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or do you prefer working for your boss?</span></p>
