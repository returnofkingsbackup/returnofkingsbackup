<p>The feminists are right. Men must shoulder the responsibility for ending rape culture, and the way we do it is this: Never date a raped chick.</p>
<p>Next time you hear (or hear of) a chick claiming she got raped, what you should do is nothing. Don’t confront or antagonize her. Don’t question her motives. Certainly don’t quibble over the particulars of the raped chick’s story; even if you prove she’s lying, the world will still insist she’s a victim (<em>see</em>: <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/60784/9-people-in-the-media-who-are-upset-jackie-coakley-wasnt-raped-by-white-men" target="_blank">Jackie Coakley</a>, formerly of UVA).</p>
<p>And don’t date her. Simple as that.</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not suggesting you forego banging a raped chick (after getting her written consent, notarized and in triplicate). Outside of a girl who is currently in the process of going ass-to-mouth with you, in many cases a chick who claims to have gotten raped is the closest thing to a guaranteed freak you can find.</p>
<p>But, whatever else you may do to her, <em>do not date her</em>.</p>
<h3>Undercutting Rape’s Appeal</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/79192493_uvafraternity_logi-e1420280845699.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-52270" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/01/79192493_uvafraternity_logi-300x169.jpg" alt="_79192493_uvafraternity_logi" width="321" height="181"></a></p>
<p>Girls are fond of falsely crying rape because in the sexually liberated West, being known as a rape victim is all upside, no downside. Raped chicks are praised for heroism and bravery. Other people lavish attention on them, and ask them to speak about themselves at length, which for chicks is like crack cocaine.</p>
<p>In extreme cases, raped chicks have leveraged their purported suffering into <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/2015/01/emma-sulkowicz-to-attend-state-of-the-union.html" target="_blank">international acclaim</a> and <a href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/lena-dunham-sings-book-deal-for-more-than-3-5-million/" target="_blank">seven-figure book deals</a>.</p>
<p>It bears mentioning that raped chicks have always been coddled and comforted (at least in the West), and in that regard, they are not so different today than before. But in times past, that coddling took place behind closed doors, among family. It was private and there was no way to leverage it into unusual status.</p>
<p>Rape was kept private is because it held terrible implications for the raped chick’s future. If she were single, she could be judged unfit for marriage. If she were married and gave birth soon after the rape, the child would be regarded with suspicion if not outright labeled a bastard.</p>
<p>Our society came to regard rape with such gravity primarily because of <em>these</em> things, and only secondarily because of the emotional turmoil a raped chick experiences as she orgasms underneath her alluring, bad-boy attacker.</p>
<p>If men once again refuse to date raped chicks, rape will become once more an infrequent source of private and passing pain, and not an <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/liz-seccurro-tells-tale-surviving-rape-fighting-justice-article-1.1052479" target="_blank">indelible</a> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/30/rape-justice-after-20-years" target="_blank">merit</a> <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1357706/Rape-victim-Liz-Seccuro-forgave-attacker-20-years-pressed-charges.html" target="_blank">badge</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/liz-seccuro/rape-the-republican-party_b_820838.html" target="_blank">to</a> <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/heide-banks/could-you-forgive-this-li_b_848925.html" target="_blank">be</a> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/liz-seccurro-tells-tale-surviving-rape-fighting-justice-article-1.1052479" target="_blank">trumpeted</a> <a href="http://www.readthehook.com/65457/painful-memoir-12-step-rape-victims-book-hits-shelves" target="_blank">across</a> <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/27/i_ins.01.html" target="_blank">all</a> <a href="http://alextimes.com/2011/01/paving-a-way-for-rape-victims-liz-seccu/" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://iris.virginia.edu/2011/09/an-interview-with-liz-seccuro/" target="_blank">media</a> <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/12/16/i-was-gang-raped-at-a-uva-frat-30-years-ago-and-no-one-did-anything.html" target="_blank">outlets</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/u-va-rape-survivor-author-questions-rolling-stone-account/2015/01/16/a50f0560-9cfe-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4_story.html" target="_blank">in</a> <a href="http://time.com/3619173/uva-rape-survivor-doubt-victim-story/" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/12876396/ns/dateline_nbc/t/letter/" target="_blank">land</a>.</p>
<h3>Why It Works</h3>
<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/woman-in-pain2.jpg" alt="A very upset and lonely woman sitting down crying against a wall" width="500"></p>
<p>Bitches and feebleminded manginas who happen across this humble call for sanity will no doubt object that my plan won’t work. Already I can see <a href="http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/" target="_blank">David Futrelle</a>’s fourth chin trembling as he stammers his rebuttal in a fit of pique:</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">

<blockquote><p>Maybe this would work against a few famous raped chicks, like Lena Dunham and Emma Sulkowicz, because they’ve gone public with their stories. But what about all the <em>other</em> raped chicks? They won’t tell you they’ve been raped till you’ve already pair bonded and shared your Netflix password with them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eloquently lisped, Mr. Futrelle, and I thank you for raising that point—<em>because therein lies the brilliance of this strategy</em>.</p>
<p>In point of fact, it hardly matters whether you do or don’t date (or even marry) a raped chick. I hear it’s a bad idea, but then again, I’ve only knowingly dated one raped chick and she was one of the most pleasant and down to earth young ladies to ever drink of my golden seed.</p>
<p>What matters is that you <em>say</em> you won’t date raped chicks, and thus encourage girls to <em>think</em> that crying rape will hurt their romantic prospects.</p>
<p>Realize that we are fighting a war of disinformation, against an unprincipled enemy that is <a href="https://twitter.com/DrewMTips/status/592425351218728961" target="_blank">openly contemptuous of the truth</a>. Nothing could be more tediously unproductive than arguing over facts with an opponent who has chosen to forego them. To win this fight, you have to hit the bitches where it hurts.</p>
<p>And for most chicks, that means attacking their romantic prospects—or, more fundamentally, their attractiveness. Even the most manjawed cunt secretly harbors fantasies of locking down a good man, marrying him, and thereby trebling her disposable income. Chicks will cry rape if it means endless, adoring attention with zero associated cost. But they won’t if they think getting raped renders them unattractive in the eyes of men.</p>
<h3>A Brief Guide To Never Dating Raped Chicks</h3>
<p><img src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/woman-cry-man-comforting.jpg" alt="Never Date a Raped Chick"></p>
<p>This is not baseless internet bravado. I have already begun testing these techniques in the wild. The effect is immediate, dramatic, and amusing. But it is important that you implement Not Dating Raped Chicks properly, so I leave you with several suggestions and one short, real-world example.</p>
<p>First, don’t seek opportunities to voice your aversion to dating raped chicks. Wait for someone else to bring it up.</p>
<p>Second, explain your position with sympathy for raped chicks, even expressing regret that you couldn’t date one. Never dating raped chicks isn’t retributive. It’s simply something you, as a man, feel compelled to do.</p>
<p>Last, don’t take individual responsibility for never dating raped chicks. Explain that <em>all</em> males feel this way; the testicular fortitude to own your feelings is all that distinguishes you from the mass of men.</p>
<p>In practice, it looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Vapid Office Chick</strong>: Did you hear about that girl who got raped at Columbia? It’s awful. I read that at the end, her attacker pulled out and jizzed the words “Reify patriarchy” across her chest.</p>
<p><strong>Enlightened RoK Reader</strong> (<em>head bowed</em>): So true, so unquestionably true. And the worst part is, now she’ll never get married.</p>
<p><strong>Vapid Office Chick</strong>: Right— wait, what?</p>
<p><strong>Enlightened RoK Reader</strong> (<em>mournfully</em>): Yeah. Most men won’t even date a raped chick. How would she ever get married?</p>
<p><strong>Thirsty White Knight</strong>: Um, wow. You don’t know what you’re talking about, dude. (<em>turns to Vapid Office Chick</em>) I don’t care about a girl’s past. I care about who she is now.</p>
<p><strong>Enlightened RoK Reader</strong>: Sure, but almost all of your friends are women. And don’t you own <em>Scandal</em> on Blu-ray?</p>
<p><strong>Thirsty White Knight</strong> (<em>with rising anger</em>): So?</p>
<p><strong>Enlightened RoK Reader</strong>: I mostly socialize with other men, and they all say the same thing: They would never date a raped chick. I’m not endorsing it, necessarily. It’s just how men are.</p>
<p>(<em>fin</em>)</p>
<p>This is a 10-megaton truth bomb, and your interlocutors will likely be angry and confused in its wake. Don’t expect them to agree with you, but don’t argue the point further. Once you’ve planted the seeds, step away and give them time to grow.</p>
<p>This is admittedly a long-term strategy. But if we band together in this effort, then someday, in the not-so-distant future, a 6.5 will find herself in her dorm room, regretfully recalling the night she got pounded out by the captain of her college’s club soccer team… and she’ll idly contemplate crying rape.</p>
<p>But then she’ll remember how much she likes the captain of the club <em>swim</em> team, and she’ll consider the impact crying rape would have on his opinion of her. And she’ll think better of her little lie.</p>
<p>And when she does, it will be because together, we took a stand against ever dating raped chicks.</p>
