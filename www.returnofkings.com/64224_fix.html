<p>This month, progressives initiated the use of a blitzkrieg tactic attack against normal men and women. On May 7<sup>th</sup>, the school board of Fairfax County, Virginia voted to add “gender identity” to the nondiscrimination policy currently enforced at its schools. The school board voted to approve the measure even though a standing-room only crowd of parents turned up to oppose it.</p>
<p>The most obvious ramification of this new policy is that if a male student decides to identify as a girl, he will be able to use the same bathrooms and locker rooms used by real girls. The change is intended to benefit the tiny minority of students who genuinely believe they belong to a different gender than the one they were born with.</p>
<p>As an aside, I think the biggest beneficiaries of the policy will probably be horny, heterosexual boys who want to see their female peers naked. Practically speaking, it will be impossible for school administrators to tell whether they are dealing with a genuinely confused student, or someone who just wants to see some T&amp;A.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the other (and perhaps more important) outcome of the change is that parents will no longer be able to request a transfer away from a transgender teacher, ensuring that a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/52220/why-is-the-transsexual-lobby-trying-to-politicize-leelah-alcorns-death">mentally ill</a> person will be charged with the formation of their child’s studies and character.</p>
<h3><strong>“Gender Fluidity”</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-64226" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/480px-a_transgender-symbol_plain3_svg-300x350.png" alt="480px-a_transgender-symbol_plain3_svg" width="400" height="467" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/480px-a_transgender-symbol_plain3_svg-300x350.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/480px-a_transgender-symbol_plain3_svg-262x306.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/480px-a_transgender-symbol_plain3_svg.png 480w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>But the Fairfax County School Board is not stopping there in its transgender jihad. The board recently released a report recommending that changes be made to Fairfax County’s family life curriculum for grades 7 through 12 to include the concept of “gender fluidity.”</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.fcps.edu/is/hpe/documents/FLECommunityReview2014-2015.pdf">report states</a> that “Emphasis will be placed on an understanding that there is a <strong>broader, boundless, and fluid spectrum of sexuality</strong> that is developed throughout a lifetime. Sexual orientation and gender identity terms will be discussed with focus on appreciation for individual differences.”</p>
<p>The report adds that “Students will be provided definitions for sexual orientation terms heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality; and the gender identity term transgender.”</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this a blitzkrieg tactic?</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-64234" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/images.jpeg" alt="images" width="276" height="183" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/images.jpeg 276w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/images-262x174.jpeg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 276px) 100vw, 276px"></p>
<p>Blitzkrieg is the German term for “lightning war.” Wikipedia defines it as a “tactic designed to create disorganization among enemy forces through the use of mobile forces and locally concentrated firepower.” The Fairfax County School Board’s introduction of the transgender agenda into the public schools fits the definition of blitzkrieg perfectly.</p>
<p>A previous example of social engineering was the campaign to gain public acceptance of homosexuality. This campaign had two fronts. On one front, gay activists introduced court cases to gain legal protections for gay people. But the primary front was by <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/59994/how-to-spot-pop-culture-indoctrination">changing public opinion through featuring charming gay characters on popular movies and TV shows</a>. This campaign to change public opinion literally took decades to achieve.</p>
<p>This time, as the Fairfax County School Board actions show, progressives are not waiting for the court cases or a change in public opinion. They are using “locally concentrated firepower” by forcing their transsexual agenda on children in one of the largest school districts in the country. It is certain that we’ll see other school districts soon following suit.</p>
<p>It is important to note that parents are overwhelmingly against the changes that the Fairfax County School Board is introducing. By introducing these changes, the members of the school board are increasing the possibility that they will be voted out of office in the next election. But it doesn’t matter because by then it will be too late—the transsexual agenda will already be firmly in place.</p>

<h3><strong>But I was born this way!</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_64228" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-64228" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bruce-jenner.jpg" alt="bruce-jenner" width="450" height="450" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bruce-jenner.jpg 450w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bruce-jenner-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bruce-jenner-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bruce-jenner-262x262.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Bruce Jenner</p>
</div>
<p>No doubt, the boldness of forcing the transsexual agenda is encouraged by the success of the gay “I was born this way” message. Heterosexuals have been conditioned to accept anyone at face value who says that he has felt a particular way since he was a child, even if there was no evidence of their preferences.</p>
<p>Recently I forced myself to watch parts of Diane Sawyer’s interview with Bruce Jenner on his transgender journey to becoming a “woman,” and the “born this way” narrative was front and center during the interview. The majority of the interview was devoted to proving that Jenner had always been a woman, and that he knew it, even when he was a child.</p>
<p>For example, when Jenner was eight years old, he snuck into his mother’s closet to try on her clothes. If that is not definitive, scientific proof that he was always a woman trapped in a man’s body, I don’t know what is.</p>
<h3><strong>What are progressives trying to achieve?</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_64230" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-64230" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w21-300x199.jpg" alt="bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w2" width="500" height="331" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w21-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w21-837x554.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w21-667x442.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w21-262x173.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w21-574x380.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bronycon_2013___random_pic_by_aleriavilrath-d6h44w21.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Picture from BronyCon.

</div>
<p>The real question is why are the SJWs within the school board willing to stake their careers on pushing transgender orthodoxy upon innocent children?</p>
<p>For the SJW masses, the answer is that the policy changes will make gender-confused children more comfortable. They will be able to pee in the bathroom that will give them the most validation. However, I suspect that the elite SJWs have darker reasons for supporting this change.</p>
<p>The first reason is that children are very susceptible to being influenced by authority figures like teachers. If a boy or a girl comes from an unstable home life, as is increasingly common, they are more susceptible to being brainwashed.</p>
<p>If the SJWs can indoctrinate these children early enough, they can ensure that the children will remain confused about their sexuality for their entire life.</p>
<p>Although the SJWs claim that they are just keeping up with the new “scientific truth” of gender fluidity, what they are really doing is using the divide and conquer strategy against the wider society. Someone who identifies as being a “transsexual female brony who is attracted to biracial cisgender male furries” will be more likely to be a ward of the state. He will also be a reliable soldier and voter (i.e. useful idiot) in support of future SJW social engineering campaigns.</p>
<p>I think that this support of these future social engineering campaigns is the second reason that SJWs are ramming the transsexual agenda down our throats so quickly.</p>
<p>What might the next battlefront be? The ultimate prize for some progressives may be the lowering of the age of consent for sex with boys. It is not hard to imagine a future where Diane Sawyer will interview a well-known celebrity with a penchant for boys. No doubt, he will claim that he was “born this way.”</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Although Fairfax County has been in the news recently due to its gender identity policy changes, it is not the first school system to have implemented changes to accommodate the needs to transgender students. The <a href="http://schools.nyc.gov/RulesPolicies/TransgenderStudentGuidelines/default.htm">New York City Department of Education</a> and other progressive school districts already have policies in place.</p>
<p>If you live in a more conservative district, rest assured that the recognition of gender fluidity is coming soon to a school near you.</p>
