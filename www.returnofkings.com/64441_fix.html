<blockquote><p>Greatness is best measured by how well an individual responds to the happenings in life that appear to be totally unfair, unreasonable, and undeserved. – Marvin J.Ashton</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the greatest realizations that the red pill teaches us is that life is unfair. This becomes even more evident in today’s heavily beta indoctrinating, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/53558/why-the-pursuit-of-pleasure-rules-modern-civilization">pleasure-driven</a> gyno-centric societies—where modern men are subject to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62220/is-the-modern-man-truly-softer-than-his-predecessors">challenges</a> which they might not even realize, on another dimension different from their forefathers.</p>
<p>But in this scenario, if there is one virtue which would help men withstand the various vicissitudes modern life would throw at them, it is that of fortitude.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortitude is the guard and support of the other virtues – John Locke</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortitude is the strength of mind that allows us to withstand the adversities in life with courage. It is what separates the achievers, the heroes and the survivors from the average – because just as genius may strengthen their ability to outwit and outsmart others, it is fortitude which grants them the resilience to resist and overcome opposition, and outlast others.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-64448" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb-300x141.jpg" alt="fb" width="300" height="141" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb-300x141.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb-837x394.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb-667x314.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb-262x123.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb-574x270.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fb.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Yet with today’s degeneracy, what we see is the increasing and gradual erosion of fortitude from men’s personalities, rendering them pussified, and even worse trained to function as compliant and dutiful slaves to dysfunctional social constructs which demean their own masculine identities, and train them to undermine that of fellow men.</p>
<h3><strong>The pussified modern Ahab</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gc.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-64450" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gc-300x168.jpg" alt="Couple role playing with dog leash" width="300" height="168" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gc-300x168.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gc-667x374.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gc-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gc-574x321.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gc.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>With modern men becoming increasingly indoctrinated towards <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/43503/the-quandary-of-seeking-sustained-emotional-fulfillment-through-women">dependency</a>, it’s common to see men being brainwashed into aping copying comical caricatures of pseudo-alphadom.</p>
<p>A modern man is raised to comply to society, his women and more important be afraid and confused of his own masculinity; which he compensates to discover by tyrannizing other men – aka <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/38706/jezebels-poisonous-spirit">the Modern Ahab</a>.</p>
<p>Yet like a ferocious Rottweiler on leash, he meekly submits to his societal puppet masters and more importantly, his woman.</p>
<p>Heavily socially indoctrinated towards feminism since birth, he’s raised to strangle his resistance to the lies taught by modern society. And because he simply lacks the necessary fortitude to rebel, he ends up living in subservience to a society and women which view him as <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/63284/how-modern-societies-are-training-men-not-to-marry">an expendable tool</a>.</p>
<p>His inability to stand up for his own ideals and masculinity cripples his masculinity—worsened by his own fear of losing out on illusionary comfort from women and material pleasures that society trains to believe as the real thing.</p>
<p>He chooses comfort—stagnating and crippling his metamorphosis into an evolved man—because he lacks the fortitude to endure a difficult but more rewarding one out of his fear of struggle. A modern man should ask: <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/which-man-are-you">what kind of man</a> am I heading to become?</p>
<h3>The necessity of developing fortitude</h3>
<h4><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/JTC7aeK_qgY.html" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></h4>
<p>In today’s world, it’s common to see the strong tyrannize the weak, while simultaneously weakening themselves by submitting themselves to societal pleasures and pressures which corrupt their own personalities.</p>
<p>At the same time, we see men end up living lives of wasted potential and frustrated ambitions simply because they lacked the fortitude to stand up for themselves, or take charge of their own lives.</p>
<p>Thus it becomes extremely important for a man (moreso a redpiller) to develop fortitude to withstand the onslaught of challenges that modern life would thrust on him – whether physically, emotionally and morally. This is best summarized in the following excerpts from <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/9544/the-author-who-was-the-biggest-influence-on-the-manosphere">The Book Of Pook</a>:</p>

<p>In today’s world of deceptive illusionist pleasures, it becomes extremely important for a man not to get lost and waste himself by submitting to these—and there is no substitute for fortitude to endure the vagaries of modern life.</p>
<p>Life is a test, and only the ones who endure it with fortitude are the true <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/49703/9-elements-of-your-quest-for-self-mastery">masters of their own destinies</a>. In the end, it doesn’t always matter where you start in life, but what does matter is how you endure it and where you finish at. Fortitude is an indispensable companion to have on that journey.</p>
