<p>Last week, <em>In Touch</em> <em>Weekly</em> broke the news that Josh Duggar, eldest son of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar from TLC’s <em>19 Kids and Counting</em>, had molested five under-aged girls in 2002 and 2003. Josh, who was 14 at the time, was accused of fondling his victims, touching their breasts and genitals while they slept.</p>
<p>A police report was released shortly after the <em>In Touch</em> article, and indicated that four of the five girls may have been his siblings, while the last victim was a family friend who had spent the night at the Duggar home.</p>
<p>The story unleashed a firestorm of criticism against the way the Duggars’ handled the situation. Jim Bob allegedly waited a year before contacting authorities and instead sought help from church elders who also did not contact the police. Josh was sent to the Basic Life Principles Training Center, a faith-based healing center and then had to live with a close family friend for period of time. Josh was never charged with a crime as the statute of limitations had run out before the police learned of the events.</p>
<p>People from the left not only called for Josh Duggar to be punished, but for the entire family to suffer by calling for the cancellation of the Duggars’ TV show the because of the incident.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In response to the criticism, Josh Duggar resigned from his position as executive director at the Family Research Council in Washington DC. A day later TLC pulled <em>19 Kids and Counting</em> off of their lineup. While the show has not officially been cancelled, its future seems to be in limbo.</p>
<p>The release of this story and the SJWs’ consequent reaction to the story gives us a great opportunity to see how SJWs work.</p>
<h3><strong>For SJWs, it’s personal</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-64731" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3-300x231.png" alt="keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3" width="500" height="385" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3-300x231.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3-1200x923.png 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3-837x644.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3-667x513.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3-262x202.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3-574x442.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/keep-calm-and-take-no-prisoners-comrades-3.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The first interesting thing about the release of the Josh Duggar story is that the molestation occurred a long time ago. <em>In Touch</em> had to issue a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain the police report. Obviously, someone deliberately tipped off <em>In Touch</em> about the existence of the report.</p>
<p>But why would someone want to expose the Duggars’ dirty laundry?</p>
<p>The Duggar family is a well-known opponent of the LGBT agenda. In 2014, they sparked outrage when they asked married couples to post pictures of themselves kissing on the Duggar Facebook page and then deleted pictures of gay couples kissing. Jim Bob and Michelle are also active in supporting conservative politicians who may oppose same sex marriage.</p>
<p>Josh Duggar was an even worse offender against LGBT sensibilities. Up until he was forced to resign due to the molestation report being released, he worked for the Family Research Council (FRC). The FRC is a conservative Christian lobbying organization that was founded by James Dobson.</p>
<p>One of the main activities of the FRC is lobbying, <em>very ineffectively</em>, against LGBT issues including same sex marriage.</p>
<p>By publicly setting themselves against the LGBT agenda, the Duggars made themselves a lightning rod for SJWs.</p>
<h4><strong>Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it</strong></h4>
<p>By digging up dirt on Josh Duggar, the SJWs are executing a strategy from Saul Alinsky’s <em>Rules for Radicals</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>RULE 12:Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can see this rule in action with almost every time you try to engage an SJW in an argument. While men traditionally would argue about ideas using logic, the SJW doesn’t bother with this. Rather, they almost always argue ad hominem by pointing out some personal failing of the person (as there is with Josh Duggar). If no personal failing is apparent, they resort to trying to categorize the person as a racist, homophobe, misogynist, or as a science denier.</p>
<h3><strong>SJWs are hypocrites</strong></h3>

<p>Contrast the criticism of the Duggars with the way that SJWs react to molestation claim that concerns one of their own—the star of the HBO series <em>Girls</em>, Lena Dunham.</p>

</div>
<p>Kevin Williamson, writing in an <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/391348/pathetic-privilege-kevin-d-williamson">article for <em>National Review</em></a>, summarized the questionable incidents that Dunham related in her memoir, <em>Not That Kind of Girl</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dunham writes of casually masturbating while in bed next to her younger sister, of bribing her with “three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds . . . anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying.” At one point, when her sister is a toddler, Lena Dunham pries open her vagina — “my curiosity got the best of me,” she offers, as though that were an explanation. “This was within the spectrum of things I did.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As Williams relates, “there is no non-horrific interpretation of this episode.”</p>
<h3><strong>Double Standard</strong></h3>

</div>
<p>Unlike Josh Duggar who immediately apologized and resigned from his job, Lena Dunham took to Twitter to condemn the “rage spiral” against her. She wrote, “The right-wing news story that I molested my little sister isn’t just LOL – it’s really fucking upsetting and disgusting. And by the way, if you were a little kid and never looked at another little kid’s vagina, well, congrats to you.”</p>
<p>Apart from the dust up around the incidents she recounted in her book, she has suffered no ill effects. She is still the star of <em>Girls</em> and her popularity is just as high as it ever was.</p>
<h3><strong>Conservatives also condemn Josh Duggar’s action</strong></h3>
<p>While a handful of conservatives, such as presidential candidate Mike Huckabee came to the defense of Josh Duggar, most conservatives were quick to condemn him. But they also pointed out the hypocrisy of people condemning Duggar but refusing to condemn Dunham.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

</div>
<p>For the record, while I believe in forgiveness and redemption, I think it was appropriate that Josh Duggar resigned from his position at the FRC. His actions as a juvenile render him an ineffective spokesman for an organization whose mission is to further policies that favor the traditional family.</p>
<p>But I think it is vindictive to go after the livelihood of his parents and his siblings. If anything, they were the victims of his actions. It is clear that the SJW outrage over Josh Duggar was not caused by a sudden concern for the emotional and physical well-being of the Duggar girls so much as glee over the misfortune of an enemy of the LGBT agenda. Otherwise, why are they trying to get the Duggars’ TV show canceled?</p>
<p>The fury with which the SJWs pursue revenge on their enemies is even more disturbing as it is obvious that the LGBT agenda is on a roll and is destined to prevail. The SJWs are not gracious winners. When their victory is complete, they will crush any dissent.</p>
<p>To be fair, the indignation that people on the right over Dunham’s touching of her sister is also probably driven, in part, by Dunham’s position as a leader in the social justice wars. Our mutual hatred for each other is just another sad indicator that our current culture is unraveling.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t foresee an end to this polarized atmosphere. In the meantime, we need to be aware of the tactics that SJWs will continue to use to hurt people that they disagree with while turning a blind eye to their similarly tainted allies.</p>
