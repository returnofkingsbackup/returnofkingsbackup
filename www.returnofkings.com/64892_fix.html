<p>Have you ever wondered why pupils are expected to rise when the teacher enters the classroom? I have, and the strangest part to me was that I couldn’t recall anybody giving us clear orders to behave in that way, yet we all did.</p>
<p>I vividly remember trying to answer this conundrum as a kid by asking adults around me. The most common reply was that the purpose of standing up in front of a teacher is showing respect. But, I asked, why aren’t we then rising when our mothers, fathers, and spouses enter the room? Or do only teachers deserve our respect? To this, nobody could reply with anything other than a blank stare.</p>

<p>It was only later, when I grew up and started digging through massive quantities of online articles, that I found out about the true origin of the education system I had been influenced by. At that point, everything became clear, and all the little idiotic things my teachers used to demand from us and that seemed so random back then suddenly started to make sense.</p>
<p>And I also found out the answer to my question: the purpose of rising when the teacher enters the room is to show obedience.</p>
<h3>Crushing the child’s soul</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/child-whining-dave-mosher.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-23523" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/12/child-whining-dave-mosher.jpg" alt="child-whining-dave-mosher" width="434" height="306"></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thenewamericanacademy.org/images/the-prussian-industrial-history-of-public-schooling1.pdf">Prussian education system</a> (not a Wikipedia link), still used to this day in most countries worldwide, originated in the early 18th century as a way to instill absolute obedience and uniformity in the students under the guise of education. What the students wanted and thought was irrelevant—the Prussian education system was there to teach them minimal literacy and indoctrinate them into believing in the infallibility of the supreme authority (Prussian King Fredrick William I at the time). The end result was a useful generic worker, readily replaceable and dispensable.</p>
<p>Teachers acted as surrogate parents that had no mercy for the child and punished all mistakes ruthlessly for the purposes of destroying trust and instilling fear. The curriculum consisted of rote reading, writing, and memorization assignments that were meant to destroy the creativity and spontaneity.</p>

<p>The grades themselves also weren’t used to measure the child’s knowledge, but rather the level of its obedience—the worst grade implied the child was rebellious and refused to follow given methods rather than that it was stupid or inattentive.</p>
<h3>Means of conditioning</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hot-teacher.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-58979" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hot-teacher-300x225.jpg" alt="hot-teacher" width="300" height="225" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hot-teacher-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hot-teacher-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/hot-teacher.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>The highly structured layout of the classroom meant pupils were disconnected from one another and easily monitored, which again emphasized the atmosphere of distrust. Even the school bell, used to mark the end and the beginning of each period, can be easily recognized as a conditioning method, later described as such by Pavlov in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>Everything is absolutely dedicated to turning a person into a robot: homework, dress codes, school uniforms and so on. Perhaps the most accurate description of the kind of retardation this education produces is in Kafka’s “The Trial.”</p>
<p>This same system was eventually transplanted into the US in 1843 and became the basis of its education system today. There were some minor changes—instead of the King, the students were taught to obey the State, but everything else is left the same. As an added bonus, there is a solid layer of SJW indoctrination that formed on top of that system in the last 150 years, to ensure children are not only intellectually but sexually crippled as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only exception to this is STEM due to its male dominance and reliance on hard facts, but of course, SJWs wouldn’t be SJWs if they didn’t want <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2012/06/20/stem-fields-and-the-gender-gap-where-are-the-women/">gender equality in computer sciences</a>.</p>
<p>The tragedy of the Prussian education system is that it continues to churn out uniform, creatively stunted workers that are ideal for an 18th century Prussian labor market <em>which no longer exists</em>. A nation’s economy relies on having a steady supply of creative people who take risks, which means we must take chances, try silly things, and generally not be afraid of failing to thrive, both personally and as a species. Otherwise, we’re all going to be royally screwed.</p>
<p>Thanks, <del>Obama</del> Fredrick William I.</p>
