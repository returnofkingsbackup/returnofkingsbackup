<p>Pretty much everyone is aware that American women are messed up, but the real question is “how did they get that way?” While this is not a complete list, here are five things that have contributed to the degeneration of American women.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Popularity of the Disney princesses </strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-66212" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768-300x225.jpg" alt="disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768" width="300" height="225" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768-837x628.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768-667x500.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768-574x431.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/disney-princesses-wallpaper-disney-princess-6248012-1024-768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Most American girls grow up watching Disney princess movies. The wildly popular franchise spans the decades from the classics like <em>Snow White</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, and <em>The Little Mermaid</em> to more recent movies like <em>Tangled</em>, <em>Brave</em>, and <em>Frozen</em>.</p>
<p>So what’s wrong with Disney princesses? Well, Disney has done a fantastic job of editing all the unpleasant aspects that colored the original fairy tales—things like consequences and failure. For instance, Hans Christian Andersen’s version of The Little Mermaid doesn’t end in a catchy song and dance number. The mermaid dies by throwing herself into the ocean and turning into sea foam. There is no happy ending or romantic rescue by the prince. He actually marries someone else.</p>
<p>Additionally, Andersen’s little mermaid faced harsh consequences for her decision to become human and pursue a mortal man. The sea witch in the story cuts out her tongue in exchange for giving her human legs, and these new legs bring the mermaid great pain as she feels like she is walking on sharp shards of glass every time she takes a step. In the Disney version, the only penalty in the story is that Ariel will become a mermaid once more if she fails to land herself a prince.</p>
<p>The bottom line is girls are indoctrinated at a very young age that even the most harebrained of schemes will always work out in the end as long as you believe. All loves, even when they involve the poorest of choices, are meant to be. Who cares if your parents disapprove? Is it any wonder that American women can’t handle the smallest of failures or that they are terrible at picking a suitable partner?</p>
<h3><strong>2. Girl power and self esteem culture lead to a delusional view of life </strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-66214" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lindywest2-300x275.jpg" alt="lindywest2" width="300" height="275" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lindywest2-300x275.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lindywest2-262x240.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lindywest2-574x527.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lindywest2.jpg 629w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Our culture has gradually been replacing real sins with imaginary ones. In place of lying and stealing, we have transphobia and not recycling. Another one of these imaginary sins is hurting someone’s self-esteem, especially the self-esteem of a girl. Whether it is in school, Girl Scouts, magazines, or sports, girls are taught that they are super awesome no matter what they do.</p>
<p>Are you obese? No problem, real men love curves. Can’t do math? It’s because the evil patriarchy didn’t do enough to encourage you to take STEM classes. Are you dim-witted? Dye your hair blue (or pink), support left wing causes, and you can consider yourself smarter than everyone else.</p>
<p>Western culture, especially American culture, is unique in promoting self-esteem above real accomplishment. In many Asian countries, classrooms are organized so that the top students sit in the front row and the worst students sit in the back. Every student always knows exactly how he stacks up against other students.</p>
<p>It might seem cruel to us, but at least their children don’t grow up with the delusion that they are special snowflakes and that everything should be handed to them on a silver platter.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Unrealistic expectations</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_66210" style="width: 285px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-66210 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/prince-charming.jpg" alt="prince-charming" width="275" height="291" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/prince-charming.jpg 275w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/prince-charming-262x277.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Most men don’t measure up</p>
</div>
<p>One result of the combination of Disney princess syndrome and self-esteem culture is that American women have completely unrealistic expectations. Every American woman expects that her future husband will be a handsome, wealthy, urbane aristocrat who speaks four languages, plays in the NBA, and sings lead vocals in a rock band. In other words, he will be Prince Charming.</p>
<p>Of course, it doesn’t matter that the woman herself is fat, lazy, ignorant, and slutty. She will still think that she deserves Prince Charming because she has been told her entire life that she is super awesome just the way she is.</p>
<p>The problem is that in the real world very few men fit the requirements for being Prince Charming. This means that most American women have to “settle” for less than they feel they deserve when they decide to get married. The modern American woman will start out her life disappointed with her husband even though he would be considered an astounding catch by any rational standard.</p>
<p>The inevitable result is that after a few years of marriage, lots of women start looking for more exciting pastures. These women will think nothing of destroying their families and leaving their perfectly loving husbands for broke DJ’s with hot tattoos and a drug problem.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Feminist-influenced media gives women a deformed understanding of what men want</strong></h3>
<h3><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-66207" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/o-COSMO-COVERS-570-300x411.jpg" alt="Unknown" width="219" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/o-COSMO-COVERS-570-300x411.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/o-COSMO-COVERS-570-262x359.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/o-COSMO-COVERS-570.jpg 570w" sizes="(max-width: 219px) 100vw, 219px"></h3>
<p>Women’s magazines spend a lot of time talking about relationships, but all of the information they provide is wrong. Here are some typical headlines from <em>Cosmopolitan </em>magazine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>21 Mind Blowing Sex Moves You’ve Never Tried Before (Introducing the Brazilian “Sweet Treat”)</p>
<p>How To Touch A Naked Man: 16 Naughty Strokes That Will Send Him Over The Edge</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same message is conveyed in television shows that are popular with women like <em>Sex in the City</em> and <em>Girls</em>: men like sluts.</p>
<p>Now, its true that men want a woman who knows “16 naughty strokes,” but only if they are looking for a one night stand or a friendship with benefits. In other words, men only want the well-worn, highly skilled slut for a pump and dump.</p>
<p>But when it comes to marriage, men are looking for innocence. No man wants his bride to beg him to give her a Dirty Sanchez on their wedding night.</p>
<p>These magazines and TV shows are not trying to provide accurate information—they are primarily trying to make money. Any information that they do provide is tainted by a feminist philosophy: <em>Cosmopolitan</em> was founded by feminist Helen Gurley Brown and <em>Girls</em> is a Lena Dunham vehicle. However, the girls who devour this tripe take it be the gospel truth and do their best to live their lives accordingly.</p>
<p>But you may be asking, why are women learning about what men want through magazines, movies, and television shows? It’s because parents have abdicated their parenting duties.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Lack of parenting</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_66205" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-66205" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isis-flag-300x150.jpg" alt="isis-flag" width="400" height="200" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isis-flag-300x150.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isis-flag.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isis-flag-837x419.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isis-flag-667x334.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isis-flag-262x131.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/isis-flag-574x287.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Hello Mr. Filthy Kuffar. We are here to date your daughter.</p>
</div>
<p>At some point after the sexual revolution in the 1960s, parents stopped giving their children any guidance on anything related to love, sex, and marriage. They will parent their children in other ways, such as encouraging them to get good grades, but not with regard to anything involving sex. With sex, there is always “no judgment.”</p>
<p>Lack of parental guidance is harmful to boys, but it is devastating to girls. Boys naturally know what they want. They are attracted to wholesome looking girls, who usually turn out to be wholesome in fact—ROK readers know that unwholesome girls<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/16837/24-signs-shes-a-slut"> usually provide “tells” about their defective character</a>. Girls, on the other hand, seem to make the worst choices when they lack parental guidance.</p>
<p>I recently saw a young couple on a date. The girl was a wholesome-looking redhead with a too-short dress. The man was a little older. He was dressed like he was part of ISIS. He was in full Islamic garb, including a hat and a long beard that was dyed red in imitation of the Prophet Mohammed—an indicator that he was a hardcore Muslim.</p>
<p>Now, on what planet would anyone think that this pairing was a good idea? The “no judgment” parent might have reservations, but he would never give them voice for fear of treading on his daughter’s free rein when it comes to dating.</p>
<h3><strong>Where does this come from?</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_66206" style="width: 266px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-66206 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx-300x352.jpg" alt="Karl_Marx" width="256" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx-300x352.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx-1200x1406.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx-837x981.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx-667x782.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx-262x307.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx-574x673.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Karl_Marx.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"><p class="wp-caption-text">All is proceeding according to plan</p>
</div>
<p>I don’t think there is a single group conspiring for the destruction of Western civilization, but at least some of what has happened to women is the result of Marxist philosophy, which is still popular among the American elite. They don’t want it for themselves, but they do want to confer it as a gift upon the unwashed masses.</p>
<p>Both Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels felt that the family was the origin of inequality and slavery. In <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</em>, Engels predicted that the family would be destroyed to give rise to “the gradual growth of unconstrained sexual intercourse.” Feminism ultimately has its roots in Marxism, so it is not hard to discern the common goals.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>The sad part of this process has been the human toll. Many men will not be able to find suitable wives in the current climate, but it is not just men. Women, too, have been sold a bunch of lies, which will prevent them from ever enjoying a normal life.</p>
