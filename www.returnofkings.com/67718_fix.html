<blockquote><p>A man is born alone and dies alone; he experiences the good and bad consequences of his karma alone, and he goes alone to hell or the Supreme abode. – Kautilya</p></blockquote>
<p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013">As with that of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/67425/10-lessons-from-the-life-of-genghis-khan">great emperors</a>, history also has numerous examples of “kingmakers”: men who ran great empires, while being the actual power behind the throne. </span></p>
<p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013">One such notable but little known ancient example is that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanakya">Kautilya</a> (also known as Chanakya, c. 350–283 BC), a philosopher, jurist, teacher, economist and royal advisor widely credited for having played an important role in the establishment of the <a title="Maurya Empire" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire">Maurya Empire</a>, which was the first empire in archaeologically recorded history to rule most of the Indian subcontinent.</span></p>
<p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013"> His social aphorisms and radical political treatise – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthashastra"><em>The Arthashastra</em></a> – shares commonalities with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DUMYCU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004DUMYCU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rok0f-20"><em>The Prince</em></a> and <em><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/54416/important-lessons-from-sun-tzus-the-art-of-war">The Art Of War</a></em>, and has garnered contemporary spotlight in <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1435956619&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=48+Laws+of+Power&amp;tag=rok0f-20">The 48 Laws Of Power</a></em> – also eliciting <a href="http://ianchadwick.com/machiavelli/chanakya-the-indian-machiavelli/">comparisons with the likes of Machiavelli</a>.<br>
</span></p>
<h3>His life: the rise of a kingmaker</h3>
<blockquote><p>Those who seek to achieve things should show no mercy. – Kautilya</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-68141" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe-300x256.jpg" alt="Mpe" width="300" height="256" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe-300x256.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe-837x714.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe-667x569.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe-262x223.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe-574x489.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mpe.jpg 1031w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Born into a priest family, Kautilya was educated at Takshashila, an ancient educational centre located in north-western ancient India, where he then <a href="http://www.ancient.eu/Kautilya/">became a professor of economics and political science.</a> Later he was introduced to the Nanda king, who humiliated him at the royal court. Kautilya then untied his lock of hair, and swore he would only tie it back once the Nanda dynasty was destroyed.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya">Chandragupta</a>, who according to Buddhist texts, was the son of the Maurya clan’s chieftain. Highly impressed after seeing Chandragupta leading a band of local youth, Kautilya picked him as the leader of the anti-Nanda revolt and to mentor him.</p>
<p>What followed next was a ruthless rise to power after years of strategic planning, complete with brutal political and military blindsides masterminded by Kautilya with his protege Chandragupta. These resulted in the destruction of the Nanda empire and even forming alliances with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucus_I_Nicator">Greeks</a> to consolidate territorial conquests.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SN.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68140" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SN.jpg" alt="SN" width="220" height="223"></a></p>
<p>After the formation of the Maurya Empire, Kautilya served as the chief advisor to both Chandragupta and his son Bindusara. Kautilya’s death, however, is shrouded in mystery and legend: some accounts say he ritually starved himself to death, while other versions say he died as a result of a court conspiracy during Bindusara’s rule.</p>
<h3>His literary work</h3>
<p>Kautilya’s lasting accomplishments were however in his two treatises: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Arthashastra-Penguin-classics-Kautilya/dp/0140446036">The Arthashastra</a></em> (code for statecraft), and the <em><a href="http://www.hinduism.co.za/chanakya.htm">Nitishastra</a></em> (a collection of aphorisms selected by him as a manual for social life).</p>
<p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013">The Arthashastra is an ancient encyclopedic treatise and manual on kingship, statecraft, economic policy and military strategy (but can be exhausting to read).</span></p>
<p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/arths.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-67782" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/arths-300x466.jpg" alt="arths" width="193" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/arths-300x466.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/arths-262x407.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/arths.jpg 322w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px"></a></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013">..a book of political realism, analyzing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work, a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good. – Roger Boesche<br>
</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013">Centrally arguing how an efficient and solid economy can be managed (in a culturally diverse autocracy), its prescriptive text lays out rules and norms for successfully running a state and conducting international relations. However, it abounds in generalities and is not descriptive of specific historical events. </span></p>
<p><span id="freeText2632286160078815013">The text remained influential until the 12th century (when it disappeared) but was rediscovered in 1904, later published with the first English translation in 1915. The disappearance of these texts for eight centuries could possibly be also a contributing factor for the subsequent lasting <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/54695/how-to-game-indian-girls-in-india">blue pill decadence</a> and societal <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/51395/5-reasons-why-you-should-not-date-indian-girls">feminization</a>, seen through India’s <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/50673/lessons-the-west-can-learn-from-indias-checkered-past">checkered history.</a><br>
</span></p>
<p>Kautilya’s wisdom in these texts has been exemplified in <em>The 48 Laws of Power</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One should not be too straightforward. Go and see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing. – <em>Law 26: Keep your hands clean<br>
</em></p>
<p>Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through scriptures and the rest of the people through their normal eyes. – <em>Law 14: Pose as a friend, work as a spy</em> <strong><em><br>
</em></strong></p>
<p>The remnants of an enemy can become active like those of a disease or fire. Hence, these should be exterminated completely completely. One should never ignore an enemy, knowing him to he weak. He becomes dangerous in due course, like the spark of fire in a haystack. – <em>Law 15: Crush your enemy totally</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Henry Kissinger in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/World-Order-Henry-Kissinger/dp/1594206147"><em>World Order</em></a> calls it as “a combination of Machiavelli and Clausewitz” that lays out the requirements of power, <a href="http://nationalinterest.org/feature/chanakya-indias-truly-radical-machiavelli-12146">which is the “dominant reality” in politics: </a>containing a realist vision of politics long before the <em>Prince – </em>while German sociologist <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weber/">Max Weber</a> once called it “truly radical ‘Machiavellianism’…compared to it, Machiavelli’s <em>The Prince</em> is harmless.”</p>
<p>Kautilya’s treatises also offer much wisdom on various topics besides statecraft, some of which has already been discussed earlier here:</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Education</strong>
</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>Education is the best friend. An educated person is respected everywhere. Education beats the beauty and the youth.</p>
<p>One whose knowledge is confined to books and whose wealth is in the possession of others, can use neither his knowledge nor wealth when the need for them arises.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>2. Focus on the present</strong></h4>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-67744" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4-300x141.jpg" alt="k4" width="300" height="141" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4-300x141.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4-837x394.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4-667x314.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4-262x123.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4-574x270.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k4.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<h4><strong>3. Friendship</strong></h4>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-67743" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2-300x141.jpg" alt="k2" width="300" height="141" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2-300x141.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2-837x394.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2-667x314.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2-262x123.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2-574x270.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/k2.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>

<h4><strong>4. Meritocracy</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A man is great by deeds, not by birth.</p>
<p>A man attains greatness by his <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/60377/the-necessity-of-meritocracy">merits</a>, not simply by occupying <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/57951/the-essence-of-true-leadership">an exalted seat</a>. Can we call a crow an eagle simply because it perches on the top of a tall building?</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>5. Wealth</strong></h4>
<blockquote><p>He who loses his wealth is forsaken by his friends, his wife, his servants and his relations; yet when he regains his riches all those who have forsaken him come back to him. Hence <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/36650/the-importance-of-money">wealth</a> is certainly the best of relations.</p></blockquote>
<h4><strong>6. Women</strong></h4>

<p>Kautilya’s harsh political realism and social red pill wisdom echoes <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/12060/single-mothers-should-be-held-accountable">ancient red pill truths</a> which have been espoused by many other great men of different cultures throughout history.</p>
<p>The contemporary relevance of his ancient aphorisms further indicates that not only has there been <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/34258/there-is-little-difference-between-women-throughout-history">little difference in the nature of women throughout history</a>, but also in the nature of societies throughout the world through time as well.</p>
