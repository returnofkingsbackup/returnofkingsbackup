<p>Modern culture appears to be dominant and unstoppable. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/66303/4-reasons-why-liberals-are-clinically-insane">Leftist insanity is increasing</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/66791/why-are-men-becoming-more-disinterested-in-marriage">traditional institutions are collapsing</a> and people with views contrary to the accepted norm are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_vUQYc3lf8">literally portrayed as monsters</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, few seem to be aware of its affects, even though they are blindingly obvious to anyone with rational capabilities. The fact that the reasoned are so greatly outnumbered makes it very difficult to organise a cogent movement to tackle the problems at source, as they are simply laughed away and dismissed by the majority (95% +) who actually believe that the only threats to Western civilization are global warming and Muslims.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that those of us who do see what’s happening are confronted with a dilemma: do we simply enjoy the decline, laugh as the ship sinks and indulge in a bacchanalian frenzy; or perhaps retreat to the country somewhere and start a farm?</p>

</div>
<p>In this article, we shall examine some of the inevitable affects of our culture and come up with rational ways to overcome them, without resorting to hedonism or escapism.</p>
<h3>Knowledge And Understanding</h3>
<p>The average person has a very limited knowledge of world affairs; this can be seen in economics. Our economies have the illusion of growth: they appear to be flourishing, giving us the freedom to reap in the benefits of technology, globalization and unrestrained liberalism. We become freer, more comfortable and prosperous.</p>
<p>We must not buy in to this delusion. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDtBSiI13fE">This economy has only been made possible by creating and borrowing money at interest:</a> every major economy is hundreds of billions, <a href="http://www.usdebtclock.org/">or even trillions in debt</a> and can never pay this money back. The world of wealth and comfort we see around us is fake and illusory and it will inevitably collapse. The people themselves copy this behavior, maxing out their credit cards to buy accessories and racking up enormous student debts; they are economically illiterate.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-67922 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Economic-Illiteracy.png" alt="" width="500" height="500" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Economic-Illiteracy.png 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Economic-Illiteracy-150x150.png 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Economic-Illiteracy-300x300.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Economic-Illiteracy-262x262.png 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>We therefore have to renounce the attitude of the majority, which consists of acquiring a stable corporate job, buying a house, consuming corporate products and not worrying at all about the economy. We must instead embrace a more minimal, <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/review-of-antifragility-by-nassim-taleb">antifragile</a> lifestyle: researching marcoeconomics, understanding debt and keeping up to date with global economic events.</p>
<p>A declining economy demands adaptability and innovation. Instead of putting faith in one stable, soul-destroying white-collar job with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/14599/human-resources-have-absolute-power-over-male-workers">anti-male HR departments</a>, it is more advisable to have a spread of viable options. For example we must remain open to a mixture of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62941/is-a-blue-collar-job-for-you">blue-collar jobs</a>, entrepreneurial pursuits and possibly working abroad.</p>
<p>We can no longer afford to rely on the modern world to protect the individual from risk and economic ruin. As the system gets more fragile, we must become more aware of the dangers and expand our options to avoid the consequences of large-scale catastrophes such as the financial crash of 2008, which will inevitably become more frequent in the future.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-67924 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/173247wall-street-crashstack.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="342" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/173247wall-street-crashstack.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/173247wall-street-crashstack-300x205.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/173247wall-street-crashstack-262x179.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<h3>Holding Strong Principles</h3>
<p>It is all well and good to acknowledge the degeneracy of modern culture, but the knowledge is useless without strong moral principles to counter it. For example, we can rightly complain about the odious “I can do what I want, it’s my body” attitude, but to then become ill-disciplined and lazy is to simply partake in the same carelessness which we criticize.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>A further example is the attitude towards the nuclear family. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/about">Although we can opt out of monogamy and reproduction if there are no incentives to engage in them</a>, if we are to consider a family, traditional discipline needs to be adhered to. Failure to do so merely contributes to the destruction of the family unit we are experiencing today.</p>
<p>Neomasculinity is a very good example of a strong set of principles which can be followed to ensure an optimized lifestyle: <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/65498/searching-for-the-ethical-principles-of-neomasculinity">they are time-tested, intelligent, and virtuous.</a> It is only ethics such as these which will prevent society from going into unceremonious decline.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-67923" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Neomasculinity-300x134.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="224" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Neomasculinity-300x134.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Neomasculinity-262x117.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Neomasculinity-574x257.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Neomasculinity.jpg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Not only are strong principles necessary to live healthily during this over-indulgent phase of history, but they will continue to be practiced long after this era has burned itself out. Those who get into virtuous habits will undoubtedly have the advantage over the others who have lived up until now without foresight or intelligence.</p>
<h3>Maintaining A Positive Outlook</h3>
<p>It is quite understandable to feel very pessimistic about the future and indignant about the fact that modern culture has sold us a pack of lies and delusions. But the way to look at our current phase of history is not the end of a line, but rather a natural stage of a cycle. Sir John Glubb describes the cyclical nature of history in his underrated work: “The Fate of Empires”. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/38515/the-age-of-pioneers">(Previously covered here at ROK)</a></p>
<div id="attachment_67925" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/at-eternitys-gate.jpg"><img class="wp-image-67925" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/at-eternitys-gate-300x385.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="641" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/at-eternitys-gate-300x385.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/at-eternitys-gate-262x336.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/at-eternitys-gate-574x736.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/at-eternitys-gate.jpg 599w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It may feel sometimes that we are indeed “At Eternity’s Gate”</p>
</div>
<p>In this essay he estimates that an Empire lasts approximately ten generations, and that the life histories of them are all extremely similar. We are currently living in the final Age, “The Age of Decadence” which Glubb describes as:</p>
<blockquote><p>“A moral and spiritual disease, resulting from too long a period of wealth and power, producing cynicism, decline of religion, pessimism and frivolity. The citizens of such a nation will no longer make an effort to save themselves, because they are not convinced that anything in life is worth saving.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the majority may hold this negative outlook, we do not have to be the same. We can instead arm ourselves with knowledge, experience and strong principles to counteract the current trends of nihilism. The large following of ROK and other like-minded communities prove that there are substantial sections of the population who refuse to give into negativity and want to pursue positive lifestyles instead.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-67926" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/community-300x94.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="156" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/community-300x94.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/community-667x208.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/community-262x82.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/community-574x179.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/community.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<h3>The Conclusion</h3>
<p>Nihilism is a very easy option for the disillusioned man to take at our stage in history. Committing to nothing, amassing an ungodly notch count and feasting off a decaying civilization like a vulture certainly sounds very appealing and would surely yield a lot of temporary thrills.</p>
<p>If we are to live like that, we risk merely living a marginally more sophisticated, hedonistic lifestyle than those who are ignorant of society’s problems. It is almost not worth acquiring the knowledge about the state of modern culture in the first place if that is the attitude that we are going to take.</p>
<p>It is far more honorable, on the other hand, to invest time into understanding our situation, following strong principles and attempting to resolve society’s problems, rather than facilitating its collapse.  This positive attitude is inspiring, which is why more and more people are drawn to communities such as ROK and will continue to be so as modern culture continues to decline.</p>
