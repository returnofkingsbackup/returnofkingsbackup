<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Hey, Mike Chang here… and I’m honored to be a fitness expert writing on Return of Kings. Now you might already know me from YouTube, and maybe you’re even one of the 3.5 million subscribers on my sixpackshortcuts YouTube channel.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">So to show you how grateful I am today for being picked as an expert… not only am I going to reveal the three eating tricks that will get you ripped, I’m also going to give you a complimentary eating system. It’s the same one me and my clients personally use to get ripped. And you’ll get that right after trick #3.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Now, you probably already know that most dieting is exactly that… a diet. But honestly man, I hate dieting so I’m not going to ask you to do that at all. My approach to eating is different –  because my goals are different. And that means I eat foods that will allow me to enjoy life, while getting a ripped body and six pack abs</span><span class="c6 c1">. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because those are my goals… not some Crossfitter, paleo crap that your friends brag about on Facebook. Because with my eating system, my body does the talking for me, and you’ll be able to experience the same thing. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1">Let’s be honest. </span><span class="c1">You don’t care about being a bodybuilder or Crossfitter, and you don’t want to spend your life hating the foods you eat. You just want to know how to get a ripped body that demands respect, in the shortest possible amount of time.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">To do this, you can’t use old school diets that are impossible to stick to. So rather than just doing the same boring, nasty diet that everyone else is doing, </span><span class="c6 c1 c12">you need to simply eat a different way…</span></p>
<p><span class="c1">So here are 3 eating tricks that will get you ripped:</span></p>
<h3><span class="c6 c2 c1">1. Eat More Often</span></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/food-kolaz3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-28635" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/02/food-kolaz3.jpg" alt="food-kolaz3" width="600" height="400"></a></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">A lot of guys think that losing your belly fat is all about eating less… WRONG! You actually need to eat more. But you have to make sure that you’re eating more of the right foods. I suggest that you eat these specific fat burning foods about every three hours. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Because when you eat these foods more often, you actually boost your metabolism and allow your body to burn more fat. And on top of that, if you eat consistently throughout the day, you are less likely to get extremely hungry and eat a huge cheat meal. And that’s why Men’s Health said a meal about every three hours will “shrink your gut.”</span></p>
<p><span class="c2 c1">If you want to know the exact foods to eat, I go into more detail with your gift that’s coming soon in trick #2.</span></p>
<h3><span class="c6 c2 c1">2. Cook Your Meals Ahead Of Time</span></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Retro-cooking1.jpg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-25677" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Retro-cooking1.jpg" alt="Retro-cooking1" width="472" height="369"></a></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">It’s important to prepare your meals ahead of time because we are not like women… we don’t enjoy cooking. So as men, we should just knock it out all at once.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">In addition when you prepare your meals ahead of time, the food is there. It’s convenient… and your chances of eating fast foods are eliminated.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Prepping your meals will also save you time and money. It usually costs me about 9 dollars a day to prep all my meals… and that’s for 5 meals. And normally, if I eat out, I spend at least 20 bucks on a normal lunch.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1">Here’s what you can do today to get started:</span></p>
<p><span class="c1">1. Go to the store and get lean cuts of meat like top round steak, chicken breast and tilapia…</span></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p><span class="c1">2. Stock up on complex carbs like sweet potatoes and brown rice.</span></p>
<p><span class="c1">3. Get some veggies like broccoli, asparagus and cauliflower</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then prepare your meals!</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c6 c1">Here are some meal ideas:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five ounces of flank steak, a cup of brown rice and a cup of broccoli.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1">Five ounces of tilapia or cod, 6 asparagus spears and one sweet potato. </span></p>
<p><span class="c1">Two whole eggs and three eggs whites. Cream of wheat and a few strawberries or a banana.</span></p>
<h3>
<span class="c6 c2 c1">3. Eat Cheat Meals</span><span class="c2 c1"><br>
</span>
</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foodie.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21278" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/11/foodie.jpg" alt="foodie" width="259" height="194"></a></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Find an eating plan that allows you to cheat, because traditional “dieting” is not sustainable. So you can’t do it forever… you know what I mean? I know when me and my friends tried it – we always gave up. Because you can only eat nasty dry tuna for so long.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">The honest truth is that sticking to a strict diet 100% of the time is close to impossible, because you can’t just grab a quick bite when you are busy, you can’t enjoy a nice juicy hamburger and fries. And worst of all – you can almost never eat out. And that’s not any way to live your life.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Eating cheat meals also increases your #1 fat burning hormone, leptin. First of all leptin controls your ability to burn fat or not to burn fat. So basically when your leptin levels are high… you burn more fat. And when your leptin levels are low – you burn less fat. So you want your leptin levels to be high, not only because you will burn more fat… but when your leptin levels are high, all of your other fat burning hormones work at their optimal levels. This means you will burn more fat. </span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c6 c2 c1">So how do you boost your leptin levels?</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">You eat cheat meals every so often. Now, this doesn’t mean you eat them every single day. However, my clients and I have proven that eating cheat meals about 20% of the time will keep your leptin levels high, and your body burning fat.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c1 c2">Now I know breaking your old eating habits and doing these three new eating tactics might be difficult… But I’ve made it easy for you in this easy to follow eating system… It’s called The Zero Willpower Eating System.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">It shows you what foods to eat and at exactly the right times.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">It also shows in detail how to prepare each and every meal for the whole week… the best part is that it shows you how to do it all in one HOUR. And that’s including clean up.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Lastly, it tells you the precise times and the delicious cheat foods you can start incorporating into your diet to get ripped abs fast.</span></p>
