<p>As many of you may know, Roosh V’s successful <a href="http://www.rooshworldtour.com">World Tour 2015</a> has already made history. For the first time, open and productive discussions are being held on issues that relate to the future of masculinity. The anti-masculine poison that the media has been trying to ram down everyone’s throats for decades is finally being confronted with a philosophy and worldview that offers an antidote to this poison, without requiring the approval of women or the SJW Bolsheviks.</p>
<p>Of course, some are unable to cope with an ideology that exposes them for what they are. Because they don’t believe in freedom of speech, and because they can’t stand to see their views challenged, they have one default setting: ban the message. The tour is currently under attack from those who would censor ideas that disagree with their own. Recently, a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1469621213354009/permalink/1474919042824226/">Facebook page</a></span> was started to try to “prevent” a peaceful lecturer from delivering talks in Montreal and Toronto. The stated reason?</p>
<p>Roosh, in the twisted, loser worldview of these people, “advocates rape.” The “evidence” of this is Roosh’s obviously satirical article which mocked the rape-accusation pretensions of the social justice warrior (SJW) crowd. Yes, it’s the usual SJW tactic of cherry picking and cutting and pasting, in order to make it seem that Roosh “advocated” something that he never advocated.</p>
<p>The apparent organizer of the Facebook page is this precious little snowflake:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowflake1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-68568" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowflake1-300x300.jpg" alt="snowflake1" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowflake1-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowflake1-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowflake1-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/snowflake1.jpg 320w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p><strong>This is the face of arrogance and intolerance.</strong></p>
<p>Her name is Aurelie Nix and her goal is to nix Roosh’s speech. It goes without saying that these people are losers. That is obvious. But notice also the upturned nose, and the self-imposed wreath signalling a delusional level of self-importance. This is the face of someone who refuses to abide by the rules of the civilized world. <em>This is the face of someone who wants to deprive you of your rights, rights that you may have risked your life to fight for. </em></p>
<p>What makes the Facebook page more disturbing is the open suggestions for disruption and violent threats that have emanated from the site. One poster on the site, named Vlad Vorontsov, made the open statement that, if he was unable to prevent Roosh from entering Canada, that he was “open” to using other methods of “shutting the event down.”  Look at his comment below. He was unwilling to get into the specifics of his criminal disruption plans, but urged other members to “PM” him for “details.”</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="Bc11ahH"><p><a href="http://imgur.com/Bc11ahH">View post on imgur.com</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="../s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The comments are revealing. They give a window into the minds of the types of people who hold themselves out as angelic innocents, all the while plotting the most devious conspiracies against free speech and discourse. These are the people who call themselves “progressives.”  In case you’re interested, this is the photo of Mr. Vorontsov, which is publicly available for all to see on his Facebook profile.</p>

<p><strong>This is the face of arrogance and intolerance</strong>.</p>
<p>Notice the snickering, smug, weasely, arrogant attitude. The headphones symbolize the willing inability to listen to any views other than those of his own arrogant, narcissistic ego. He is closed out to the world, and island unto himself.  And in his mind, he’s perfect, just perfect.</p>
<p>But it gets worse.</p>
<p>Under the Canadian Criminal Code, threatening violence is itself a crime. And it is clear that Mr. Vorontsov has stated his intention of trying to shut down the lecture using illegal means. It can be construed as an invitation to violence. This is especially true when we consider the last comment that someone posted in the screenshot about, in which a reader tosses out the idea of a bomb threat. Whether this was serious or not, words have consequences.</p>
<p>SJWs love to lecture the world about how words have consequences, but are unwilling to accept the harms that their words cause.</p>
<p>Here is the relevant Canadian Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46) section.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Uttering threats</strong></span></p>
<p>264.1 (1) Every one commits an offence who, in any manner, knowingly utters, conveys or causes any person to receive a threat<br>
(a) to cause death or bodily harm to any person;<br>
(b) to burn, destroy or damage real or personal property; or<br>
(c) to kill, poison or injure an animal or bird that is the property of any person.<br>
Marginal note:Punishment</p>
<p>(2) Every one who commits an offence under paragraph (1)(a) is guilty of<br>
(a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or<br>
(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months.</p>
<p>(3) Every one who commits an offence under paragraph (1)(b) or (c)<br>
(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or<br>
(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.<br>
<em>R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 38; 1994, c. 44, s. 16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether he was kidding or not, Mr. Vorontsov needs to be questioned about his stated desire to shut down Roosh V’s lecture. This is especially true in light of the last comment that was made in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>More than anything, these statements reveal the modern SJW for the sniveling cowards that they truly are. They cannot handle dialogue. They cannot handle opposing viewpoints. They look for reasons to be outraged over nothing, and then call on big daddy government to censor people who hurt their feelings.</p>
<p>Failing that, they resort to illegal disruption as ways of enforcing “tolerance.” What are Mr. Vorontsov’s “ideas” that people should PM him about regarding how to disrupt Roosh’s lecture? And why hasn’t Aurelie Nix condemned Mr. Vorontsov?</p>
<p>Does she approve of such intimidation tactics?</p>
