<p>Some of the common signs of low testosterone are fatigue, lethargy, erectile dysfunction, creaky joints, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, and loss of muscle mass combined with weight gain. If you are experiencing these symptoms, you may need to get your testosterone checked. In fact, there is an ongoing low testosterone epidemic in many Western countries: 50% of men over age 40 have low testosterone, and that skyrockets to 80% of men over 50. Most men are not aware of this, accepting these symptoms as “getting old.”</p>
<p>I personally started having symptoms including erectile dysfunction when I hit 30. My <a href="http://www.trtguide.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">personal low testosterone horror story</a> then ensued and left a shattered marriage in its wake. Fortunately, my story has a happy ending.</p>
<p>I got on a proper Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) regimen, and my erections are back, stronger as ever. I dropped 30 pounds. I bedded more than a dozen young nubile women this year alone, with no “technical difficulties” whatsoever. I have more energy now at age 35 than ten years ago. My mind is sharper as ever.</p>

<p>I’ve been through hell and back, and lived to tell the tale. I wrote a book about my experience, and how men can combat low testosterone without wasting precious time and money: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Nonsense-Guide-Testosterone-Replacement-Therapy-ebook/dp/B00ZT2AIXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437338460&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=no+nonsense+guide+to+testosterone+replacement+therapy?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><b>The No Nonsense Guide To Testosterone Replacement Therapy</b></a><b>.</b></p>

<p>By now, it should be clear what low testosterone can do to a man. But it gets worse: Low testosterone is not just an inconvenient malady to bull through. It is a very real and insidious medical condition that, at best, severely stunts your masculine potential. At worst, it ruins lives, destroys relationships, rips families apart, and ultimately increases your risk of heart attack, diabetes, brittle bones, and cancer. Here are three surprising reasons low testosterone is dangerous for your health:</p>
<h3><b>1. Erectile Dysfunction Is The First Warning Sign Of Heart Disease</b></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3_erectile.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-68670" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3_erectile-300x205.jpg" alt="3_erectile" width="300" height="205" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3_erectile-300x205.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3_erectile-262x179.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/3_erectile.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>You may have heard that testosterone increases the risk of heart attacks. This is completely false. It’s a myth and I blow it to smithereens in Part 3 of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Nonsense-Guide-Testosterone-Replacement-Therapy-ebook/dp/B00ZT2AIXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437338460&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=no+nonsense+guide+to+testosterone+replacement+therapy?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">book</a>. The longer your testosterone remains low, the higher your risk of heart attacks climbs every year.</p>
<p>Let me explain: heart disease begins when arterial plaque build up begins. It starts out slow, just a few little buildups along the arteries. A little plaque here and there is no big deal and won’t impede any blood flow through the biggest arteries.</p>
<p>But, the blood vessels in the penis are extremely tiny compared to the big coronary arteries around the heart. A “little plaque” within those narrow vessels may just be enough to gum up the works during a hot date. While blood flow remains perfectly unimpeded through the rest of the body, blood flow through the tiny penile capillaries may not be optimal even with smallest bits of plaque. So a “little plaque here and there” may seem like no big deal, UNTIL it starts affecting you in the bedroom.</p>
<p>Testosterone has a profound effect on a man’s lipid profile by increasing fat metabolism and optimizing endothelial function. Low testosterone decreases fat metabolism, impairs endothelial function, reduces the production of HDL, a good cholesterol. These cascading effects allow LDL, a bad cholesterol, to increase as well as enlarge LDL particle size. This promotes arterial plaque in many men beginning as early as age 20 to 25. In fact, recent studies (like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21982312">this</a> and <a href="http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2014/3/response-to-media-reports-associating-testosterone-treatment-with-greater-heart-attack-risk/page-01">that</a>) show that by raising your testosterone from below 350 to over 550, you decrease your heart attack and stroke risk by over 30%!</p>
<h3><b>2. Lower Testosterone Levels Increases Risk Of Prostate Cancer</b></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/4_prostatecancer.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-68671" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/4_prostatecancer-300x105.jpg" alt="4_prostatecancer" width="300" height="105" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/4_prostatecancer.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/4_prostatecancer-262x92.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>

<p>The testosterone-causes-prostate-cancer is a widely-believed myth that has been disproved by recent studies. In fact, the lower your testosterone levels are, the higher your risk for prostate cancer. Recent <a href="http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2008/12/destroying-the-myth-about-testosterone-replacement-prostate-cancer/page-01">studies</a> thoroughly debunk this long-standing myth. A <a href="http://urologytimes.modernmedicine.com/urology-times/content/tags/aksam-yassin/no-link-found-between-testosterone-replacement-therapy-prost?page=full">report</a> in the Urology Times by Wayne Kuznar also asserts that there is no link between TRT and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>As Dr. Yassin puts it, we’ve experienced a “paradigm shift in the last decade that testosterone replacement therapy does not cause or increase the incidence of prostate cancer.” Prostate cancers are sensitive to changing concentrations of testosterone when the testosterone levels are very low. However, once the prostate tumor is saturated with testosterone, adding more testosterone will have little, if any effect, on the tumor growth.</p>
<p>In addition, nearly 45% of men with hypogonadism had prostate cancer in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980615">Dr. Yassin’s study</a>, “meaning that hypogonadism offers no protection against prostate cancer. Patients with lower testosterone values had higher staging and higher [prostate cancer grade] scores,” he said. Furthermore, his study concludes that testosterone replacement therapy is safe in hypogonadal men.</p>
<h3><b>3. More Men Are At Risk Of Osteoporosis Due To Low Testosterone</b></h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-68672" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones-300x155.jpg" alt="5_brittlebones" width="300" height="155" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones-300x155.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones-837x431.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones-667x344.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones-262x135.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones-574x296.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/5_brittlebones.jpg 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>The fact that we have <a href="http://www.trtguide.com/low-testosterone-than-grandfathers/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">lower testosterone than our own grandfathers</a> shows how sad the state of affairs are today. To make matters worse, osteoporosis is becoming an increasingly important public health problem. The main cause of osteoporosis in men is testosterone deficiency, according to this <a href="http://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/living-with-osteoporosis-7/male-men">WebMD article</a>. A <a href="http://www.niams.nih.gov/health_info/bone/osteoporosis/men.asp#e">NIH publication</a> also lists low testosterone as one of the causes of osteoporosis in men.</p>
<p>An essential hormone to support bone density is estrogen, and in men, some testosterone converts to estrogen in order to maintain strong bone mass and density. When testosterone falls too low, there isn’t enough testosterone to be converted to estrogen, so bones begin to weaken. Given that testosterone usually decline by 1% per year in aging men, it is not surprising that bone mineral density also declines by 1% per year as per this <a href="http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/jc.2009-1740">study</a>.</p>
<p>As a young man, osteoporosis may be one of the last things in your mind right now, but with low testosterone levels left unchecked, you can look forward to a future of unexplained fractures, being confined to a wheelchair, and watching your retirement savings get drained by a constant stream of five-figure medical bills. Sustaining your testosterone at healthy levels help maintain strong bone density to support an increased muscle mass, along with experiencing a myriad of other immediate benefits. Multiple birds with one stone.</p>
<h3><b>How I Fixed My Low Testosterone</b></h3>
<p>Now, you cannot just walk into a doctor’s office, get on testosterone, and be done with it. So many men do TRT all wrong, making their condition even WORSE than before they started.</p>
<p>First, some doctors may not order all the necessary prerequisite baseline tests before starting their patients on TRT, or will they adequately monitor patients on TRT. This is a grievous mistake that may mask other health problems or root causes of low testosterone until it’s too late. Second, many men are on ineffective and/or expensive forms of TRT such as gels or patches. Third, many men are dosing testosterone incorrectly, potentially causing their estrogen levels to climb to unhealthy levels, leading to man-boobs or an enlarged prostate. These problems arise from doctors who don’t really know what they are doing with respect to TRT:</p>
<p>In my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/No-Nonsense-Guide-Testosterone-Replacement-Therapy-ebook/dp/B00ZT2AIXI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437338460&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=no+nonsense+guide+to+testosterone+replacement+therapy?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">book</a>, I explain how to do it the right way, and make it work for YOU. Indeed, one of the hardest parts of getting on a TRT protocol that works is finding a good doctor who knows what he is doing. Here’s a brief recap of what you get from my reading my book:</p>
<ul>
<li>A thorough explanation behind low testosterone levels: causes and symptoms.</li>
<li>Lists of blood tests to help you and your doctor make a full diagnosis and treatment plan.</li>
<li>Options for your TRT regimen, and how to tailor them to yourself individually.</li>
<li>How to navigate a broken healthcare system to find the best TRT doctor for you.</li>
<li>Your TRT Toolbox: An information-packed system to manage your own TRT.</li>
