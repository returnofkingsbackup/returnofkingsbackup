<p>False rape claims distort the pursuit of justice and ruin the lives of innocent men. I want both men and women to know the signs of a false rape so that men can protect themselves and women can avoid looking like a liar if they were legitimately raped.</p>
<p>So let’s get to it. After many years of reading and hearing about <a href="http://falserapesociety.blogspot.com/">various rape cases that were eventually dismissed</a>, I started to notice patterns surrounding false rape accusations. While not any one of these tests are conclusive, if you see two or more of the signs below, your bullshit alarm should be going off.</p>
<h4>1. Virtually no evidence of struggle</h4>
<p>Contrary to what a lot of feminists claim, girls fight back when someone is trying to put an unwanted object in their vagina. Perhaps the most frustrating form of last-minute resistance known to man is having a naked girl on your bed who refuses to open her legs. How is a man supposed to rape her short of beating her down and tying her up?</p>
<p>Feminist response: <em>“But what if the attacker has a knife/gun/(insert weapon here)?”</em></p>
<p>Unless the victim was approached in complete isolation, the attacker is going to have a very hard time sneaking in a weapon without being noticed in most public places, let alone raping her in public. And if a woman was raped in isolation, like some kind of back alley, then this test doesn’t apply because she is a true victim.</p>
<p>Feminist response: <em>“But what if she goes over to his house, or he goes over to her house?”</em></p>
<p>This brings us to our next point…</p>
<h4>2. The attacker is invited to the victim’s house OR the victim willingly went to the attacker’s house</h4>
<p>Put yourself in a criminal’s shoes. If you wanted to rape a woman and get away with it, why would you rape a woman who invited you over? The evidence is already stacked against you should anything happen to her. The police would know for certain that you were in the same residence as her.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that a woman who claims to have been raped in her own house by a man she knew beforehand is a suspicious claim, since a man looking to rape someone would not pick a target who could identify him to the police.</p>
<p>This is especially true in our digital age – cell phones have GPS tracking systems, cars have GPS chips built in, and if someone so much as accesses the internet at a residence in any way a record is created – so the risk of being caught for any crime rises dramatically when in a personal residence. It would be impossible to create an alibi of being somewhere else.</p>
<p>The same is true for a man raping a woman he invited over to his house: why would he do such an act, knowing he could not deny being in the same residence with her? It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Feminist response: <em>“But according to all the statistics, most women are raped by men they know!”</em></p>
<p>This brings us to the final, and most obvious sign…</p>
<h4> 3. Authorities are alerted days, weeks, or even months after the rape</h4>
<p>If your car is robbed, do you wait a few weeks before telling the police? If your house burns down, do you wait a few months before making a claim?</p>
<p>I often hear women do not report rapes right away because they are ashamed or humiliated to report that it ever happened. This is pure bullshit because any rape victim working with the police can request to have their identity hidden from the press, and both the police and press must honor such requests under penalty of law.</p>

<p>The most likely reason a woman waits to file rape charges is because she herself doesn’t know how she feels about the sex she had – “Oh, he was cute but I was really drunk…” – and needs to convince herself she was somehow wronged.</p>
<p>But, in the real world, it’s easy to see when you’re wronged. Things like being raped aren’t ambiguous. The only reason women wait to report a rape is because they are unsure of how to spin a convincing story, or because pangs of guilt prevent them from doing so. Ultimately, when women make a false rape charge it’s to avoid admitting the man she slept with was a mistake.</p>
<p>Thus if a woman says she was “date raped” by a man she already known, and he had her at knife or gun point, ask yourself: How long did she wait to report the crime? Anything less than 36 hours and I would become suspicious.</p>
<h4>Applying the tests</h4>
<p>Try it for yourself. Go review some famous false-rape charges, such as the ones levied against Dominique Strauss-Khan, Julian Assange, or the Duke lacrosse players. You’ll see in all cases unharmed women who were properly on the same premises as the attacker, and, in the case of Assange, women who took their <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden">sweet time to file some charges</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>When he was later interviewed by police in Stockholm, Assange agreed that he had had sex with Miss A but said he did not tear the condom, and that he was not aware that it had been torn. He told police that he had continued to sleep in Miss A’s bed for the following week and she had never mentioned a torn condom.</p></blockquote>
<p>I lived with my rapist for a week?</p>
<p>After looking at false rape reports, be sure to look at an <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/pizza-delivery-boy-rapes-woman-manhattan-apartment-police-article-1.1171032">actual rape case</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lucas arrived Saturday at the doorman building with a pizza for a customer on the 10th floor. Once his work was done, the teen allegedly found his way to the victim’s unlocked door down the hall.</p>
<p>“He goes through the building opening doors,” said the victim, a modeling agent, as she wiped away tears. “There I am with my daughter sleeping. And he rapes me with my daughter right next to me?”</p>
<p>The rape occurred inside a bedroom filled with dozens of porcelain and plastic dolls belonging to the little girl. Cops said the attacker tried to muzzle the victim’s cries by putting his hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>“It seemed fake,” said the victim, who said she woke up a little disoriented to find Lucas already on top of her. “I opened my eyes. I said, ‘Get off. What are you doing?’ I was hysterical.”</p>
<p>Lucas was tracked down by police through the building doorman, who let him inside, and the customer, who steered them to the pizza shop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see the above case, an actual rape involves strangers, trespassing, and intense signs of struggle. While the three tests aren’t 100% accurate, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/5855/game-does-not-need-science">since nothing can be known with complete certainty</a>, these indicators will be right more often than not.</p>
<p>So learn the difference, and end the abuse of our justice system.</p>
