<p>It has now been around two months since Roosh visited London on his world tour. The day was very educational and revealing, and I feel it appropriate to discuss some of my thoughts, having had enough time to reflect on the event.</p>
<p>By looking back at a couple of aspects, we can get a clear insight into our current situation and come up with steps we can take to ensure that we can keep on developing as individuals and as a community.</p>
<p>Concerning the event itself, the testimonies on the <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-48641-page-5.html">Roosh V Forum</a> provide great descriptions of not just the London event, but also the others on the tour from different perspectives. It is well worth reading through the reviews from the attendees and thoughts by forum members.</p>
<h3>The Demographic</h3>
<div id="attachment_69445" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-69445 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/london1-500.jpg" alt="london1-500" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/london1-500.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/london1-500-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/london1-500-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Roosh’s photo of London on a sunny Saturday afternoon, before the lecture</p>
</div>
<p>Although the demographic has varied slightly from city to city, the diversity of attendees especially at the London event was very significant. The event was not just diverse in age and ethnicity, but everyone had a different reason for coming. There were of course the young aspiring men, seeking game advice, but also fathers, seeking help for their children and people concerned with cultural collapse.</p>
<p>The majority of attendees had also traveled alone, and come from quite far in order to get to the venue. Unlike concerts or films, where one usually goes with a social group, this was a collection of individuals who most likely do not share the same opinions as their peers at home.</p>
<p>This shows us that the community is small and fragmented: rather than being a unified group who are all similar in personality and interact with each other regularly (feminists being a prime example), our followers appear to be distributed randomly across the country, spanning many different ethnicities, social groups, and ages, each with different motivations for attending the event.</p>
<div id="attachment_69446" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-69446" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slutwalk_Toronto.jpg" alt="Slutwalk_Toronto" width="500" height="329" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slutwalk_Toronto.jpg 1000w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slutwalk_Toronto-300x197.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slutwalk_Toronto-837x550.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slutwalk_Toronto-667x438.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slutwalk_Toronto-262x172.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Slutwalk_Toronto-574x377.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">We certainly didn’t look like this…not yet anyway.</p>
</div>
<p>Although this displays a great capacity for individual thinking among the attendees, it can be very difficult to establish cohesion with everyone hundreds of miles from each other.</p>
<p>It is therefore very important to keep communicating with others in this community and exchange Neomasculine ideas, give and receive advice, and most importantly to form friendships with people on the same wavelength.</p>
<h3>A Feeling Of Unease</h3>
<p>Stripping down the day to its core components: a lecture, Q &amp; A and post-speech socializing, there is nothing particularly out of the ordinary. Historically a (mostly) all-male event such as this would have been perfectly commonplace.</p>
<p>However, there was a strong feeling at the venue that something clandestine and underhanded was taking place. Roosh made the point during the speech that in Berlin, they were hiding, whilst men in gimp suits pranced about just outside, gaily in the German “Straße” during the local “Pride” parade.</p>

</div>
<p>It says a lot about the current state of society when a group of males discussing self-improvement are doing so behind closed doors. This leads us to ask: why is an event like this so unusual? Why is it so counter-cultural and niche, when the issues being contemplated are centuries, if not millennia old?</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>It is somewhat worrisome that something so ordinary has become so abnormal. Canada has since proven that a handful of men discussing important issues can arouse the most virulent hysteria, obscene threats and even criminality.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/59572/male-spaces-are-under-attack-again-at-londons-garrick-club">intensifying assault on male-only spaces</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/49279/freedom-of-speech-is-dying-in-sweden">draconian attitudes towards free speech</a>, it becomes ever more imperative to uphold age-old traditions, for even very basic things such as organizing a group of less than a hundred people together are now being looked upon suspiciously in our modern era; this leads us conveniently onto the next point:</p>
<h3>The Reaction From The Media</h3>
<div id="attachment_69448" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-69448" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stasi03a.jpg" alt="PICT9838.JPG" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stasi03a.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stasi03a-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stasi03a-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stasi03a-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Are they Stasi in disguise?</p>
</div>
<p>A much discussed aspect of the London event was the presence of the BBC. The general consensus is that they seemed impartial on the day but many highly distrust them as an institution; a perfectly reasonable point of view to hold. They added a sense of paranoia to the event. We can at this point, only wait until the documentary airs before coming to a rational conclusion.</p>
<p>One striking point about the BBC was their total ignorance of the community. It became apparent through their questioning (“So, are you a PUA then?”) that they had little knowledge of why everyone had turned up. It is very likely that they had simply patched together various prejudgments and ideas together to form an opinion of us; the BBC were actually quite honest on the day in saying that they were expecting a PUA gathering as opposed to an intellectual discussion.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-69449" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BPC-British-Propaganda-Corp.gif" alt="BPC British Propaganda Corp" width="500" height="286"></p>
<h3>In Closing</h3>
<p>The fact that men who convene together and discuss now-tabooed issues are looked upon with curiosity with a shade of contempt makes it very important to actively participate in the community’s ideas, form bonds with others who share the same ideas, and inspire others to do the same. As the community is so scattered and events like the Roosh tour are gradually being looked upon as more and more strange, it will be nice to see more days like this in the future.</p>
<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>I would like to thank the gentlemen who I met up with in the pub for lunch before the event, (and then again for dinner and a few pints) for giving me the idea to write down my reflections on the tour, and of course, to everyone who attended and made it such a great day.</p>
