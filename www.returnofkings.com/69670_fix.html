<p>Whether you’re a man who has chosen to be a lifelong womanizer or indulging in some reckless slut slaying before settling down for a while, we all know that one of the main components of the player lifestyle is staying emotionally unattached to women who don’t provide value outside of notches.</p>
<p>Any man who has experience with women will tell you this is much easier said than done. The fact of the matter is that the longer you have sex with a woman, the greater the odds become that you’ll eventually catch feelings for her, even if she may not be all that high value—it’s a mathematical inevitability.</p>
<p>There are, however, quite a few ways for you to keep those feelings at arm’s length and remain the stoic pussy pirate you set out to be when you first started banging her. Here are my top eight:</p>
<h3>8. Share very little personal information with her</h3>
<div style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../techraju.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/block-on-fb.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="279"><p class="wp-caption-text">This would be a good place to start</p>
</div>
<p>One of the main things a woman does to lock a man down is pretending to be the woman she thinks he wants her to be. Red pill awareness forces men to realize that most women within the context of a sexual relationship are actresses.</p>
<p>A female will quite literally mold herself into the woman she believes her man wants her to be in every way, and the way she accomplishes this is finding out what makes him tick.</p>
<p>To steer clear of this pitfall it’s imperative that you share very little personal information with her. This doesn’t mean you’re not going to share <em>anything </em>with her. It’s natural for nuggets of personal info about yourself to slip every once in a while during conversation.</p>
<p>But long talks about your hopes and dreams, past relationships, and the like are a no-no if you want to keep her from fine tuning her personality to trap you into committing to her.</p>
<p>Sometimes girls realize your lack of forthrightness and will straight up ask you: “So what are you looking for in a woman?” My go to answer for this is:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m not really sure, but I’ll know it when I see it.</p></blockquote>
<h3>7. Limit your time with her</h3>
<div style="width: 210px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../www.simplymorocco.com/Downloaded%20Images/timepiece_200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="227"><p class="wp-caption-text">Less is more</p>
</div>
<p>I touched on this in the introduction and this cannot be overstated. Your time, being your most valuable commodity, is also <em>her</em> most valuable commodity. She knows that the more she occupies your time, the more attached you’ll become.</p>
<p>The two rules I employ to keep this from happening to me with girls I don’t see as long-term contenders are: 1) don’t spend consecutive nights with her and 2) don’t take her out.</p>
<p>Now it’s not always going to work out this way. When the sex is awesome and you don’t have anything else lined up for the following night, you may decide to plunder her pussy for a second straight night on occasion, and sometimes you may want to let her tag along when you grab a bite to eat every once in a while.</p>
<p>It’s no big deal to bend these rules every now and then, but so long as you’re exercising discipline and not making it a habit, you’ll be able to maintain frame and keep her scarcity mentality in tact.</p>
<h3>6. Do not spend money on her</h3>
<div style="width: 550px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/tightwad-money-e1406422912652-540x2841.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="284"><p class="wp-caption-text">Hos aren’t worth it</p>
</div>
<p>This should go without saying but even the most experienced players will slip on this particular banana peel.</p>
<p>Girls are keenly aware that man’s investment of any sort is necessary to secure a commitment from him. Emotional investment is what she’s after because she knows financial investment comes soon after.</p>
<p>If she’s a low-level girl, don’t let her get her foot in the door in the slightest. If you’re at the movies, say “You get the tickets, I’ll get the popcorn.” If you’re out getting food, make her pay her own way. Not only will this increase her respect for you while simultaneously decreasing any perceived thirst, this lets her know that the your arrangement is strictly sexual and nothing else.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t pony up $4 for her coffee or any other situation where it’s just a few bucks for whatever she’s getting. You definitely need to avoid being viewed as an ATM, but being a cheapskate is a huge turnoff.</p>
<p>Just remember that at the end of the day this is the ironclad rule you must adhere to in order to keep her from getting a foothold on your finances or emotions.</p>
<h3>5. Do not name her contact on your phone</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/one.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-69862" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/one-300x500.jpg" alt="one" width="180" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/one-300x500.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/one-262x436.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/one.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a></p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/two.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-69864" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/two-300x500.jpg" alt="two" width="180" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/two-300x500.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/two-262x436.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/two.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a></p>
<p>This may seem inconsequential and unnecessary but I can assure you that nothing could be further from the truth on both counts.</p>
<p>Assigning a name for any given FWB automatically creates an emotional commitment to her. That commitment may be small, but it’s significant nonetheless. When you replace her number with “Michelle” it psychologically elevates her status which automatically lowers your value.</p>
<p>However, by not assigning her name to her number keeps her status at exactly what it should be—a number. True players know that a woman they’ve fucked is no more important than any of the others so there’s no need to give her the privilege of being given a name in your phone.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Personally, I like to assign names of objects, verbs, sex acts etc. to my stable such as “Anal on 1st,” “B.J. addict,” or “Swallower 2.” Not only does this help me keep them straight by word association via objectification (which further disconnects you to them emotionally), it comes in handy when I get a text from one after not hearing from them for a while and texting back “who is this” which almost never fails to moisten her panties.</p>
<p>So whether you decide to leave her number in as just a phone number, take the Donovan Sharpe objectification method (patent pending), or put your own personal spin on it, whatever you do <strong>do not use her name</strong>. If you do, you may as well assign the name “My Everything,” “Soulmate,” “My Love,” or whatever other name that would make the vast majority of the ROK readership to throw up in our mouths.</p>
<h3>4. NEVER introduce her to family or friends</h3>
<div style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../www.magforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/how-to-deal-with-your-boyfriends-friend.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300"><p class="wp-caption-text">Huge no no</p>
</div>
<p>This is another obvious one but I see dudes violating this commandment on the regular and it almost always causes problems.</p>
<p>Once you introduce her to family or friends it a) elevates her status in everyone’s eyes b) gives her a backdoor entrance to learn more about you which is essential to molding her personality to fit your desires, and c) allows her to infiltrate your inner circle, which makes it very difficult to get rid of her.</p>
<p>All women are cognizant of what’s at stake in terms of being introduced to the people you trust and love which is why the are always pushing to meet or hang out with your family and friends.</p>
<p>Be especially aware of dark triad women or women with dark triad traits. These chicks will start the process of manipulation immediately because when the shit hits the fan (and it will) you’ll realize much too late that everyone around you has been brainwashed to the point that they’ll automatically take her side and even assist her in your dismantling.</p>
<p>Dark triad or not, it would behoove you to stay extremely vigilant of keeping your fuck friends away from your most stable social infrastructures like your friends and family.</p>
<h3>3. Only text for logistical reasons</h3>
<div style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../cdn.sheknows.com/articles/2013/02/man-flirting-text-message-horiz.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="300"><p class="wp-caption-text">Setting up the date</p>
</div>
<p>This is another rule in Pickup 101. But women are very good at creating a crevice of conversation out of nothing to draw you into long conversations in order to extrapolate valuable information out of you. Even I fall into this trap sometimes.</p>
<p>The solutions to this are simple. When she tries to strike up conversation with open ended questions like “So what are you up to?” or “Do you have any brothers or sisters?” you can either ignore the probe completely or just give brief answers like “stuff” or “yep.”</p>
<p>The only extended conversations via text should be setting up the time, day, and venue of your meetup and even then your texts should be short and sweet: “I’m going to xyz bar at 10pm Friday night. Meet me there.”</p>
<p>Anything outside of logistical texting is setting yourself up for failure on many levels.</p>
<h3>2. Assume she’s fucking someone else</h3>
<div style="width: 400px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="http://www.littleanswer.com/up/cevap/1422/cheatw1.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="273"><p class="wp-caption-text">Don’t take it personal playa….that’s how they are</p>
</div>
<p>If you have a fuck buddy arrangement with even a decent looking American woman there’s a pretty good chance she’s fucking at least one other dude on the side.</p>
<p>Men are territorial by nature and rarely commit to women who show signs of sexual disloyalty (thirsty simps notwithstanding). As a man with a good understanding of a woman’s true nature, resolving your mind to the fact that she’s probably getting cozy with someone else will automatically disconnect your emotions.</p>
<p>Your logic tells you that low-investment, perfidious pussy, while good in the short term for getting your dick wet on the regular and keeping your abundance mentality operational, is a bad bet in terms of any sort of commitment. As a result, you’ll find it very difficult, if not impossible to catch feelings for her.</p>
<h3>1. Ignore what she says</h3>
<div style="width: 466px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="http://www.soompi.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/I-love-you.png" alt="" width="456" height="257"><p class="wp-caption-text">Don’t fall for this shit</p>
</div>
<p>Ever heard these before?</p>
<p><em>“I’ve never felt this way about anyone.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I feel so safe and protected with you.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I know we’re just fuck buddies but I swear you’re the only one I’m fucking right now.”</em></p>
<p>And the big one….</p>
<p><em>“I think I’m falling in love with you.” </em>Or something to that effect.</p>
<p>Me too. I’ve bought into these statements before and after some reflection I’ve found that these proclamations were probably untrue at the time they were stated.</p>
<p>The best defense against this beta bait is to ignore it. All of it.</p>
<p>Girls throw this particular brand of bullshit out to try and rope you in and elevate themselves out of bargain basement pussy status. It’s also a subconscious shit test to see if you’re as gullible as the last mangina she played like a fiddle while she fucked her way through every member of the local cover band.</p>
<p>Never forget that <strong>what women say and what women do are two different things</strong>. Even if they truly believe what they are telling you at the time it’s important to keep in mind that it can and (likely) will change in a heartbeat the minute you lose frame, a better option comes along, or for no reason at all.</p>
<h3>Do these apply to all fuck buddies?</h3>
<p>You bet your ass it does. Any girl who agrees to be your pussy pal and nothing more needs to kept away from your emotions, your resources, and your inner circle. Access to any of these will ultimately lead to your undoing.</p>
<p>Keeping all of these rules in mind when running a harem will all but assure that you’ll never get emotionally roped in by a woman who deserves nothing more than a roll in the hay.</p>
