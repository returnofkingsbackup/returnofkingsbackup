<p>Suppose we asked 100 men if they would rather:</p>
<p>1. Own a brand new Lamborghini.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2. Own a used Volkswagen.</p>
<p>What would they chose?</p>
<p>Obviously we all know the answer – they would prefer to own the Lamborghini.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because looks matter – at least initially.</p>
<p>In my experience (dating &amp; bedding 60+ beautiful women before turning 25) this is something that is often overlooked – yet should never be underestimated.</p>
<p>There are many ways to improve your looks. Getting ripped or getting a tan are two of them. I firmly believe that in addition to fixing these fundamentals, adding edge to your image can work wonders.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, I define an edgy style as <em>a style that sexualizes your image and increases your likelihood to make a strong first impression.</em></p>
<p>A man with an edgy style has more sex appeal than one who doesn’t. Guys with edge stand out from the crowd like that sexy ass Lamborghini. They are the ‘bad boys’ girls want to hook up with – over and over again.</p>
<p>In this article I’m going to share 14 ways you can start adding edge to your style. There is no need to implement all the suggestions – but I want to give you some ideas to get the ball rolling. In the end it’s up to you to decide what fits your personality best.</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Get inked.</strong>
</h4>
<p>It should come as no surprise that women love guys with tattoos. The media has done a fine job of creating an image in their mind of what a bad boy should look like – and rarely are tattoos <em>not</em> included.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Get a sharp haircut.</strong></h4>
<p>A good hairstyle can make a massive difference on your overall image. In my experience, the most edgy looks are those with an undercut or those with long hair (shoulder length). If you got curly hair – definitely go for the long-hair option. My wingman kills it simply because of this.</p>
<h4>3. Get a necklace.</h4>
<p>Whether it’s a dog tag, a sabre-tooth or a Maori pendant, a lot of women love guys with a necklace. There is a reason you often see guys wearing one while he is fucking a beautiful girl in the movies – it sends out a badboy vibe.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Get a leather jacket.</strong></h4>
<p>Oh how I love the classics. Leather jackets perfectly fit the badboy stereotype and instantly add edge to any man. Make sure you get one made from <em>real</em> leather though.</p>
<h4><strong>5. Get leather boots.</strong></h4>
<p>When I say leather boots I don’t mean biker boots that look like they were made in the 70s. Rather, I mean smooth boots that are both fashionable <em>and</em> edgy.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p2.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-69860" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p2-300x352.png" alt="p2" width="273" height="320" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p2-300x352.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p2-262x307.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p2.png 433w" sizes="(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px"></a></p>
<h4><strong>6. Get (leather) bracelets.</strong></h4>
<p>Any type of bracelet is a good way to add edge to your style. If you want to rock a beachy look go for stuff made from wood, otherwise, I would recommend you to stick with semi-shiny (leather) bracelets. Don’t go overboard though – remember that less is more.</p>
<h4><strong>7. Get a ring.</strong></h4>
<p>No I don’t mean get married. A simple, small black or silver ring often does the trick. For some reason it intrigues women why you are wearing one – don’t ask me why.</p>
<h4>8. Get pierced.</h4>
<p>If done tactfully a piercing will instantly launch you in the upper echelons of sex appeal. I know a guy for example with a nipple piercing (clearly visible through his shirts) who absolutely cleans out house parties. Places to consider: nipples, eyebrows, tongue, and ears.</p>
<h4><strong>9. Get a beanie, cap, or hat.</strong></h4>
<p>Once upon a time I started a little experiment by writing down what I was wearing on days I received the highest number of looks and eye-smiles. Lo and behold, my best days were those when I would be wearing a beanie or cap.</p>

</div>
<h4><strong>10. Get a beard.</strong></h4>
<p>Personally I can’t grow a beard even if my life depended on it. That being said, men with good scruff or a beard are perceived as higher value by women and suggest he is not too pre-occupied with his style and lives like a badass. Do I hear wet panties drop?</p>
<h4><strong>11. Get denim wear.</strong></h4>
<p>Whether it’s a nice pair of jeans, a shirt or a button-down, anything made from denim has a high ‘James Dean’ factor which creates that boyish yet edgy look. Grab a cigarette to complete the look (semi kidding).</p>
<h4><strong>12. Get colored contact lenses.</strong></h4>
<p>Okay so this one is a bit controversial but let’s keep an open mind here. Getting colored contact lenses can <em>completely </em>change your look in an instant. If you are fairly tanned and have dark hair you will destroy with light colored eyes. If you are blonde and fair skinned prepare to clean out with brownish tones.</p>
<h4><strong>13. Get a good pair of sunglasses.</strong></h4>
<p>Again the media is responsbile for this one. Show me a badass blowing shit up and I’ll show you a badass wearing a good pair of sunglasses.</p>
<p>And last but not least..</p>
<h3><strong>14. Get a leather wristwatch.</strong></h3>
<p>One of my pet projects right now is <strong><a href="http://www.chronodos.com?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">www.chronodos.com</a></strong>,where we sell artisan leather wristwatches. I own several myself, and so far all our customers are ecstatic about their watches. They serve as solid conversation starters and the bold designs and leather cuffs make them easily stand out from all the others.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p3.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-69861" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p3-300x202.png" alt="p3" width="350" height="236" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p3-300x202.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p3-262x176.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/p3.png 432w" sizes="(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"></a></p>
<p>I understand they might not be for everyone – and that’s okay.</p>
<p>That being said, I invite you to go ahead and take a look to see if there is something you like. The added value lies in the handmade leather cuffs.</p>
<p>If you want a badboy leather accessory – this is your best bet. It will certainly add solid edge to your style—and you <em>will</em> get noticed.</p>
<p>Many times women were able to come and talk to me because I made it easier for them to actually compliment me on my watch. You should expect similar effects, at the very least.</p>
<h3><strong>Pour conclure</strong></h3>
<p>As a man it is your duty to present yourself the best way possible. I highly encourage you to add edge to your style to increase your sex appeal and badboy image.</p>
<p>Once I started adding edge to my style my results began to skyrocket. I’ve seen similar results in many close friends of mine who I helped out.</p>
<p>Let’s consider this ‘sponsored’ post a medium for us to discuss edge and help each other maximize our sex appeal and looks.</p>
