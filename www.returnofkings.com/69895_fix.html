<p>Regardless of how much progressives and “conservatives” drone on about equality, every society has an elite or noble class. The nobility, also known as the aristocracy, is defined as the group of people who belong to the highest social class in a particular country.</p>
<p>In the past, membership in the aristocracy was based on heredity. The nobility was synonymous with duty, honor, education, refinement, and courage. The noble class wasn’t just a group of wealthy do-nothings. They were expected to live by a higher code that included concern for the well being of their country.</p>
<p>Today, we still have an aristocracy, but it is not based on heredity. Instead it is based on wealth, celebrity, and educational background. Unfortunately, our new aristocrats are almost the complete opposites of the old nobility.</p>
<h3>The Old Aristocracy</h3>
<div id="attachment_69897" style="width: 279px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-69897 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Karl_of_Austria-300x334.jpg" alt="Karl_of_Austria" width="269" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Karl_of_Austria-300x334.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Karl_of_Austria-262x292.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Karl_of_Austria.jpg 361w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Emperor Karl, last of the Hapsburg Emperors</p>
</div>
<p>The hereditary nobility of the past was derived from the warrior class of the middle ages. Medieval society was divided into three basic groups: the priests, the nobles, and the peasants. Each group played a role in society. The job of the nobles was to protect the peasants and priests enabling them to complete their daily functions.</p>
<p>The behavior of the English nobility during the First World War is a good example of this. The British aristocracy enlisted in the military to defend the country. The nobility suffered disproportionately greater casualties than any other social class. The staggering losses suffered by the nobility forever changed the political trajectory of Britain. Historian Joanna Bourke writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>This had a devastating impact: the prime minister’s son was killed, a number of cabinet members’ sons were killed and this meant that in the immediate postwar, those apprentices who were expected in the natural order of things to become leaders – particularly in politics and business – were no longer there.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the old nobility, fighting for their country wasn’t something to be avoided or just for the lower classes, these wealthy aristocrats felt that it was their primary duty.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just defense. The old aristocratic codes called upon the nobility to disdain wealth and to be generous with the poor.</p>
<h3>The New Aristocracy</h3>

<p>Flash forward to our present degenerate culture. In today’s twisted society the “nobility” has become a class of wealthy, materialistic, and amoral twits. The concepts duty, bravery, and honor are completely unknown to them.</p>
<p>Who are the new nobility? Well, in the United States, it is the wealthy, liberal political elite such as the Kennedys, Bushs, and Clintons, Silicon Valley billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, reality show nobodies like the Kardashian clan, professional athletes, and the handful of preachy actors and writers that dominate the Hollywood scene.</p>
<h3>The Clintons: Representatives of our political nobility</h3>
<div id="attachment_69909" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-69909" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493-300x164.jpeg" alt="b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493" width="500" height="274" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493-300x164.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493-837x458.jpeg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493-667x365.jpeg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493-262x144.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493-574x314.jpeg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b09793e78bfb32247f0f6a706700ef01_r900x493.jpeg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Political Aristocrats: Revenant Bill Clinton telling President Obama about the horrifying side effects of a vegan diet.</p>
</div>
<p>The Clintons are an example of everything that is wrong with American politics. Of course, there are Bill’s notorious affairs while he was in office, and the rumors of dalliances after he left office, but that is really inconsequential when compared to the rest of the Clinton legacy.</p>
<p>The most egregious example is the Clinton Foundation. Author Peter Schweizer, in his book <em>Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich</em>, alleges that the Clintons amassed hundreds of millions of dollars by doing political favors for their clients.</p>
<p>For example, Schweizer writes that a Saudi sheik who is a high-dollar Clinton Foundation donor had a lucrative relationship with Ethiopia’s repressive government. Even though the State Department found that Ethiopia failed to meet transparency requirements to receive US aid, Hillary, as Secretary of State, conveniently granted Ethiopia a waiver.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-69902" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Hillary-Vegas-top-640x480-300x225.jpg" alt="Hillary-Vegas-top-640x480" width="300" height="225" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Hillary-Vegas-top-640x480-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Hillary-Vegas-top-640x480-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Hillary-Vegas-top-640x480-574x431.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Hillary-Vegas-top-640x480.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>If Schweizer is correct, the Clintons have turned the US government into a money making machine for themselves. This is hardly the selfless behavior that one would expect from a true noble.</p>
<p>But I am not singling out the Clintons here. They are only an example of how our political elite no longer has the good of the country as their goal. Their only goals are personal enrichment and power.</p>
<h3>Mark Zuckerberg: Representative of our corporate nobility</h3>

</div>
<p>Another glorified American nobleman is Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Worth an estimated $38.6 billion, the Internet entrepreneur was listed among Time magazine’s 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world.</p>

</div>
<p>Zuckerberg has put his wealth and influence to use by spending an estimated $25 million for pro-amnesty candidates and causes via his pro-open borders lobbying group FWD.us. Amnesty helps large corporations by increasing the supply of low-income workers, thus driving wages down for those jobs. But lower wages hurt American workers, especially those who are the most vulnerable including poor Hispanic and Black Americans.</p>
<p>But Zuckerberg isn’t only interested in lowering wages for poor Americans. He also wants fewer jobs and lower wages for the middle class. He supports increasing the number of H-1B visas for skilled that will increase the supply of skilled workers for corporations. That means American STEM graduates have fewer and lower paying job opportunities. Some young men <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/48373/permanent-unemployment-is-americas-permanent-future">despair of ever finding a good job</a>. All this at a time when college costs have skyrocketed and the amount of student loan debt young Americans are carrying is at an all time high.</p>
<p>If the aristocracy is supposed to help the “peasants” of their own country, Zuckerberg is failing miserably. To him and our other corporate elites, what really matters is their own bottom line.</p>
<h3>The Kardashian Clan: Representatives of our “celebrity” elite</h3>
<div id="attachment_69904" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

</div>
<p>As a family unit, the Kardashians embody virtually every vice and plague our current culture glorifies: gross materialism, do-it-yourself porn videos, bastardy, multiple divorces, promiscuity, gender fluidity (see Bruce Jenner), and extreme narcissism. The family has built an impressive empire upon Kim’s enormous naked ass and propensity for attention whoring.</p>
<p>But would this “noble” group actually do anything good for our failing country? Would the fabulous Kanye West with his titanic ego, take up arms to defend our nation if the need arose? Or would he simply hide behind one of his overpriced, <a href="http://www.style.com/trends/fashion/2015/kanye-west-yeezy-x-adidas-season-1-lookbook">Yeezy Season 1</a> creations? After all why worry about the “little people” when Kim can preach body fat acceptance with <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3194840/Is-Kim-Kardashian-role-model-pregnant-mums-Women-Vogue-hail-lister-s-naked-selfies-inspirational-sexy.html">nude pregnancy selfies</a>? (Warning: what has been seen, cannot be unseen.)</p>
<p>I do have one good thing to say about the Kardashians: as odious as they are, at least they do not lecture me about how I should pay more in taxes to save the world. I respect that.</p>
<h3>Professional Athletes</h3>
<div id="attachment_69906" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="size-medium wp-image-69906" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Corporal_Patrick_Tillman-300x391.jpg" alt="** FILE ** Former Arizona Cardinals football player Pat Tillman, is shown in a June 2003 file photo, released by Photography Plus.

</div>
<p>There was a time when professional athletes weren’t just about their enormous salaries, fame, scores of girlfriends, and going bankrupt five years after retiring from sports. In December 1941 after the bombing of Pearl Harbor many professional athletes were eager to enlist and fight against the Axis of Powers in World War II. And they enlisted despite the fact that serving in the military could have ended their professional athletic careers.</p>
<p>Bob Feller enlisted in the Navy the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, making him the first MLB player to enter the war. He spent 26 months as chief of an anti-aircraft gun crew on the USS Alabama. Likewise, Ted Williams served with the US Navy and US Marines during World War II, where he received his pilot’s wings and commission as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps. After a return to professional baseball he was recalled for active military service in 1952 where he flew 39 combat missions.</p>
<p>Compare the patriotism of these athletes of the past to the fact that only one professional athlete, Pat Tillman, felt the call of duty after the terrorist attacks of September 11<sup>th</sup>. Keep in mind that 9/11 was an attack on the US mainland, something that hasn’t happened since the War of 1812, and that, unlike Pearl Harbor, it was targeted at civilians.</p>
<p>However, to their credit most athletes are content to live their own lives, and they don’t spend much time lecturing the “smallfolk.”</p>
<h3>The Hollywood Elite</h3>
<div id="attachment_69907" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-69907 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stephen-king-300x300.jpg" alt="stephen-king" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stephen-king-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stephen-king-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stephen-king-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stephen-king.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Stephen King</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps the greatest of American noble hypocrites are the actors and writers of the so-called Hollywood Elite. Stephen King, whose novels I actually enjoy, has spent the last few years lecturing the middle class on why they should agree to taxes that will inevitably prevent them from getting wealthy while sitting comfortably upon his own fortune. This idea of “wealth for me, but socialism for the proles” is a familiar trope among our new aristocrats.</p>
<p>Likewise, a slew of Hollywood actors such as Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Natalie Portman preach the evils of global warming. Through an assortment of foundations and publicity stunts like tooling around in a Prius or wearing vegan shoes, these champions of the environment will tell you the importance of taking two-minute, cold showers, and limiting your consumption of toilet paper to one square per bowel movement.</p>
<p>Of course, they will conveniently overlook the fact that they fly in private jets and live in houses that use enough electricity to power a third world country. In short, it’s very much like Jennifer Lawrence preaching morality and abstinence.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>C.S. Lewis was prophetic when he wrote: “Where men are forbidden to honor a king, they honor millionaires, athletes, or film-stars instead: even famous prostitutes or gangsters. For spiritual nature, like bodily nature, will be served; deny it food and it will gobble poison.”</p>
<p>While we can’t do anything at the present time to remove our new aristocrats, we at least can nourish our souls with what is best: high quality art and music, classical philosophy, and sound theology.</p>
