<p>Yesterday, unemployed gay black journalist Vester Flanagan <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/26/vester-l-flanagan-idd-by-va-police-as-person-of-interest-in-wdbj-double-murder/">brutally killed two of his former colleagues at Roanoke, VA TV station WDBJ</a> during the middle of a live broadcast before turning his gun on himself. Before he went on his rampage, Flanagan sent ABC News a manifesto <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/shooting-alleged-gunman-details-grievances-suicide-notes/story?id=33336339">in which he detailed his reasons for his crimes</a>, namely his anger at “racism” in America and purported “homophobic” discrimination he suffered at his job:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is unclear whose initials he is referring to. He continues, “As for Dylann Roof? You (deleted)! You want a race war (deleted)? BRING IT THEN YOU WHITE …(deleted)!!!” He said Jehovah spoke to him, telling him to act.</p></blockquote>
<p>As is typical for the leftist media, the debate around Flanagan’s killings revolves around gun control, with his race and his sexuality barely mentioned at all. Indeed, before Flanagan’s race became public knowledge, #BlackLivesMatter leader DeRay McKesson attempted to blame his killings on “whiteness,” and even after it became known that he was black, other #BlackLivesMatter supporters expressed glee at a black man killing white people in cold blood:</p>

<p>The questions that no one are asking are about the roles that Flanagan’s homosexuality and the leftist media played in inspiring his shooting spree. For years now, the media has been deliberately stoking enmity and hatred between blacks and whites through biased, selective coverage and outright lies about stories such as the Ferguson riots and the George Zimmerman case. Couple this with Flanagan’s mental instability—a likely byproduct of his homosexuality—and we have a toxic stew of racial resentment and murderous rage.</p>
<h3>Are Homosexuals Ticking Time Bombs?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-69963" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/gay-flag-hate.jpg" alt="gay-flag-hate" width="308" height="191"></p>
<p>Despite the leftist media claiming that gays are no different than straights, homosexuals are prone to a host of deviant behaviors and mental disorders that are either less prevalent or outright nonexistent among heterosexuals. For example, <a href="http://psychcentral.com/lib/higher-risk-of-mental-health-problems-for-homosexuals/0006527">homosexuals suffer from mental illness at a <em>much</em> higher rate than straights</a>. It’s highly possible that Vester Flanagan’s mental state was related to his homosexuality, as he claimed to have suffered “persecution” for being gay in his manifesto.</p>
<p>Additionally, the leftist media has wallpapered over a <em>wide</em> variety of sick, antisocial behaviors that homosexuals engage in as a matter of course. For example, because homosexuals are incapable of controlling their sexual urges, they suffer from STDs at nearly epidemic rates.</p>
<p>HIV is largely a gay disease; <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/gender/msm/">gay and bisexual men account for over <em>60%</em> of all HIV infections in the U.S.</a> despite composing only two percent of the population. These catastrophically high infection rates are due to <a href="http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_average_number_of_sex_partners_a_gay_man_has_in_a_lifetime">the staggering amounts of sexual partners gay men have</a>, as well as their refusal to use condoms:</p>
<blockquote><p>Prior to the AIDS epidemic, a 1978 study found that 75 percent of white, gay males claimed to have had more than 100 lifetime male sex partners: 15 percent claimed 100-249 sex partners; 17 percent claimed 250-499; 15 percent claimed 500- 999; and <strong class="bbc">28 percent claimed more than 1,000 lifetime male sex partners</strong>. Levels of promiscuity subsequently declined, but some observers are concerned that <strong class="bbc">promiscuity is again approaching the levels of the 1970s</strong>. The medical consequence of this promiscuity is that gays have a greatly increased likelihood of contracting HIV/AIDS, syphilis and other STDs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the leftist media has openly hidden the fact that gay pedophiles are using marriage and adoption in order to procure prepubescent children to rape. In 2013, gay couple Mark J. Newton and Peter Truong were convicted of child sexual abuse after they had a son via artificial insemination <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/named-the-australian-paedophile-jailed-for-40-years-20130630-2p5da.html">solely so they could molest him and pimp him out to other pederasts</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Police believe the pair had adopted the boy ‘‘for the sole purpose of exploitation’’. The abuse began just days after his birth and over six years the couple travelled the world, offering him up for sex with at least eight men, recording the abuse and uploading the footage to an international syndicate known as the Boy Lovers Network.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prior to their conviction, Newton and Truong were given fawning coverage in <a href="http://winteryknight.wordpress.com/2013/07/01/why-two-dads-are-better-than-one-pro-gay-adoption-abc-profile-of-convicted-pedophile-mark-newton/">an ABC (Australian Broadcasting Company) article on gay couples adopting children</a>.</p>
<p>Given the demonstrably higher rates of mental illness that homosexuals suffer from as well as the creepy paraphilias they engage in, it’s not a stretch to say that Vester Flanagan’s murders were in part due to his sexual orientation. While not all gay men are potential murderers, Flanagan’s homosexuality-induced mental disorders were <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/63900/brandon-bostians-amtrak-crash-exposes-the-problems-with-homosexuals-in-america">a clear motivator in his decision to slay two white journalists on live TV</a>.</p>
<h3>How The Media Inspired Vester Flanagan</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-69967" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trayvon-martin.png" alt="trayvon-martin" width="500" height="431" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trayvon-martin.png 1083w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trayvon-martin-300x258.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trayvon-martin-837x721.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trayvon-martin-667x575.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trayvon-martin-262x226.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/08/trayvon-martin-574x494.png 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Another ignored aspect of the Vester Flanagan story is the role the leftist media played in stoking his delusional rage and murderous fantasies.</p>
<p>For the past few decades, the mainstream media has <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/46099/why-the-media-uses-the-death-of-michael-brown-to-promote-racial-division">consistently pushed a narrative of poor, downtrodden blacks in America</a> being abused, discriminated against, raped, and murdered by whites. Irresponsible journalists will seize upon any story that seemingly fits this narrative—no matter how flimsy the evidence—in search of what Tom Wolfe called the “<a href="http://www.vdare.com/posts/the-hunt-for-the-great-white-defendant-a-reading-list">Great White Defendant</a>.”</p>
<p>For example, the leftist media turned Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, black men shot to death while committing crimes, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/50230/media-manipulation-in-ferguson-sets-a-dangerous-precedent">into martyrs victimized by white racism</a>. It doesn’t matter that the evidence pointed towards Martin being a budding thug or the clear-cut evidence that Brown was a hardened killer (as shown by his attempt to tackle Darren Wilson and steal his gun); the media extensively covered these incidents, painting Martin and Brown as innocent victims of white bigotry.</p>
<p>By ginning up anger among blacks at purported racist mistreatment, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/41948/the-ferguson-riots-and-why-good-cops-will-quit">the leftist media is actively helping foster a race war in America</a>. The fracas over the Michael Brown shooting resulted in several days worth of race riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and now we have a gay black man openly stating that he decided to kill white people solely because the media told him that whites are out to get blacks.</p>
<p>The leftist media is eager to blame any case of a white man going postal on right-wingers. For example, Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof (mentioned by name in Vester Flanagan’s manifesto) <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/66592/one-man-in-state-of-five-million-kills-nine-people-governor-removes-confederate-flag">was blamed on <em>American Renaissance</em> and the Council of Conservative Citizens</a>. Isla Vista shooter Elliot Rodger was blamed on the manosphere, despite the fact that <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/36397/elliot-rodger-is-the-first-male-feminist-mass-murderer">he was a part of the anti-manosphere forum PUA Hate</a>.</p>
<p>By their own logic, the mainstream media and leftists have the blood of Vester Flanagan’s victims on their hands.</p>
