<p>Hey man, it’s Clark Shao. Most people recognize me as the #1 trainer on YouTube. And with over 3.5 million subscribers, you may have even watched one of my videos and tried one of our intense workouts on our Six Pack Shortcuts Channel.</p>
<p>Now what you may not know is that I personally train a small group of men in my local area at home. And these guys are seriously dedicated… from eating the perfect diet to never missing a workout.</p>
<p>However, there was a major problem that 6 out of these 8 men were facing… These guys weren’t getting the same results as my other clients even though they trained just as hard.</p>
<p>And what I discovered, with the help of a doctor friend of mine, was that these men were suffering from low testosterone.</p>
<p>Now I’m sure you’ve heard of testosterone… but what does it really do? Well, testosterone is the main male hormone, and the exact hormone that makes us men. And the more of it you have, the faster you can get ripped and muscular.</p>
<p>And one more thing… more testosterone equals more sex. Pheromone research actually shows that women are genetically attracted to men with high testosterone levels. And of course they always like a guy in great shape, which comes from testosterone too.</p>
<p>So, if you don’t have the body you want or you have a bit of belly fat that you just can’t seem to lose… low test can be the reason why. Now don’t worry, you won’t have to see a doctor to fix this… because I have 5 simple things that you can do today to boost your test levels immediately.</p>
<p>So it’s vital that you read this and follow these steps… because if you don’t… this can happen to you if your low test gets worse:<br>
●    Fatigue and Lack of Energy<br>
●    Early Hair Loss<br>
●    Low Sex Drive<br>
●    Low Semen Volume<br>
●    Loss of Muscle Mass<br>
●    Increase in Body Fat<br>
●    Mood Swings (like a woman)<br>
●    No Desire For Sex</p>
<p>Now I wrote this article to stress to you how powerful this hormone is and to tell you specifically how you can get more of it today… because research has shown that women want it… so man, we’ve got to have a lot of it, right?</p>
<p>For starters, like I stated above, it’s the main driving force behind your sexual urges. And testosterone helps build a man’s muscles, deepens his voice, and boosts the size of your male parts. It’s also what keeps a man’s muscles and bones strong… so in short, it’s what makes a man a man.</p>
<p>So the worst part about talking to my clients who had low T was that most of them didn’t even know that they could suffer from that at such a young age… most of them are in their 30’s! I mean, isn’t that something that happens to guys in their 70’s. Apparently not.</p>
<p>Because in doing my testosterone research I found that doctors were all saying the same thing. Dr. Edmund Sabanegh of the Cleveland Clinic, for example, said that “After age 30, testosterone levels dip about 1 percent each year. As internal stores of that hormone decline, men can experience a loss of muscle mass and strength, depression, lethargy and a waning interest in sex.”</p>
<p>So let’s get right to it. Here are the 5 ways to attract women and pump up your sex life:</p>
<h3>5. Eat Fat, Boost Your Test</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-61946" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-300x214.jpg" alt="perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442" width="300" height="214" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-300x214.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-262x187.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442-574x409.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perfect-porterhouse-steak-620x442.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Often thought of as the ultimate “physique destroyer” when it comes to getting in shape, dietary fat is actually one of the most critical players when it comes to optimizing natural testosterone production.</p>
<p>Long gone are the days in which we associate fat with heart disease and elevated cholesterol levels; it’s now recognized as a sure way to increase testosterone levels. In fact, a study published in the “Journal of Applied Physiology” found that diets with higher amounts of monounsaturated and saturated fats have been shown to increase testosterone levels.</p>
<p>And in another study, men who switched from a high-fat diet (13 percent saturated fat) to a low-fat diet (5 percent saturated fat) experienced significantly lower testosterone production rates, and lower circulating androgen levels.</p>
<p>“Keep in mind that when it comes to dietary fat, it’s not just the amount of fat you eat, but also the type of fat,” says Don Gauvreau, MSc, co-founder PharmaFreak.</p>
<p>So what I recommend is adding foods such as avocados, raw coconut and whole eggs (not just the egg whites!) to your daily diet.</p>
<h3>4. Consume The Right Vitamins And Minerals</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/zinc.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-34397" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/zinc.png" alt="zinc" width="412" height="285"></a></p>
<p>You may not realize this, but the biggest factor controlling your hormones is what you choose to put in your body. So it could be a total game changer if you know what vitamins and minerals boosts your natural levels of testosterone and which foods have them.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of what has worked best for me:<br>
●    Shrimp: Casting your net for seafood like shrimp is a surefire way to boost your level of vitamin D, which has a strong link to the big T. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston found that men with higher levels of vitamin D also had higher levels of testosterone.</p>

</div>
<p>●    Pumpkin seeds: Great source of zinc, a mineral that plays a role in thousands of different enzymatic reactions in the body, including those involved in testosterone production. It’s no major surprise, then, that a study published in “Nutrition” found that men with inadequate zinc intake had lower testosterone concentrations.</p>
<p>●    Strawberries: A leading source of vitamin C, higher intakes of this potent antioxidant have been associated with lowering cortisol levels in response to hardcore workouts. Cortisol is a catabolic hormone released by the adrenal glands in response to stressful situations, including intense exercise. Unfortunately, cortisol competes with testosterone, so high levels can crowd out testosterone, thereby reducing its anabolic benefits.</p>
<h3>3. Get Hormone Boosting Sleep</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-59918" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep-300x256.jpg" alt="black man sleep" width="300" height="256" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep-300x256.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep-1200x1023.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep-837x714.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep-667x569.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep-262x223.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/black-man-sleep-574x489.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, but this is where a lot of guys fall short because did you know that your testosterone levels are directly related to your sleep patterns? It’s been reported that men who get a full 7-8 hours of sleep had double the testosterone than guys who slept less.</p>
<p>Your test levels peak in the morning and slowly plummet towards the evening…</p>
<p>…And when you’re in the deepest stages of your sleep, the endocrine system comes to life. Your brain starts sending signals down to your balls, telling them to produce massive amounts of testosterone, preparing you for the day ahead. So go to bed on time, man.</p>
<h3>2. Squat</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Squats.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18611" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Squats.png" alt="Squats" width="373" height="244"></a></p>
<p>Now, I know that leg day is sometimes a day that is dreaded all week long. But squats can actually induce muscle growth all over your body.</p>
<p>Squats are also credited for increasing testosterone levels. However, to get this hormonal boost, you need to perform the exercise at the appropriate intensity.</p>
<p>You see, high-volume resistance training of moderate-to-high-intensity with short rest intervals stimulates greater hormonal response than high-intensity low-volume resistance training with long rest intervals. For example, after a warm-up with a light weight for 10 to 12 reps, do 10 sets of five reps each of barbell squats. Use 70 percent of your one-rep maximum, and a two-minute rest between sets. A study at the University of Kansas, Washington University, St. Louis, reported in the July 2010 issue of, “Fiziol Cheloveka,” found that volunteers using a similar exercise protocol showed a significant increase in testosterone levels.</p>
<h3>1. Use A Test Booster That Boosts Your Testosterone And Blocks Estrogen (what I do)</h3>
<p>Naturally boosting your testosterone with a proven test booster is the fastest and most efficient way to safely get your test levels to highest point possible.</p>
<p>However, you can’t just buy any regular test booster that you find on the shelves at your local grocery store. Because, if you didn’t know, most of these cheaply-made and mass-produced boosters can cause more harm than good if you’re a man trying to lose fat and build muscle.</p>
<p>Back when I was first doing my research I discovered that the biggest problem with test boosters is that they don’t block the feminizing hormone that could completely undo all of your hard work. You see, your body will always try to maintain a balance… so if your test levels increase your body will automatically increase your levels of estrogen too. And it does this because your body thinks it needs the estrogen and doesn’t realize that you’re trying to get a ripped body.</p>
<p>So what do you do if you need to up your test but don’t want the negative feminizing side effects of estrogen?</p>
<p>Well luckily, modern science has given us a safe and even more effective way of doing this without having to force down pounds of certain foods or having to spend hours in the gym everyday. Nope. My team and I have discovered a mix of all natural herbs that promote a boost in your natural occurring testosterone while also blocking any unwanted estrogen that your body may be producing.</p>
<p>It’s called Test Reload, and it’s the <a href="http://sixpackshortcuts.com/rd2qG?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">first dual action test booster available</a>… Not only will it help to signal your body to increase its own testosterone production, but it’ll also block any of the estrogen, or “feminizing hormone,” that could be ruining your gains and your life.</p>
<p>Unlike other test booster supplements, Test Reload was designed with your health in mind. This means that any estrogen caused side effects won’t be an issue when you take it, and you won’t have to go through any post cycle testosterone therapies to get your body normal after you’re done.</p>
<p>I personally helped to formulate Test Reload so I could guarantee it’s safety and effectiveness. This is the exact stuff that helped my clients to turn around their low test conditions. Test Reload helped to get them the <a href="http://sixpackshortcuts.com/rd2qG?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">shredded muscular</a> body that they’ve always wanted easier than they ever thought possible.</p>
