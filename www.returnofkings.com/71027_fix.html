<p>It is often stated that feminism is not only bad for men, but bad for women as well. While the negative effects of feminism may be obvious to any man who has traveled abroad and seen feminine, kind, loving, happy women with long hair, heels, and a strong commitment to their family, there is now scientific evidence <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/46543/women-should-save-their-virginity-for-marriage">proving t</a>hat the cock carousel is disastrous for family life and women are LESS happy when given all the freedom feminism has provided them.</p>
<h3>The Evidence</h3>
<p>University of Pennsylvania researchers Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers studied the happiness of women in the United States from the 1970s through present day and found an astounding conclusion: the more society accommodated women, gave them jobs, and scholarships, and supported them living single, and encouraged them to pursue their own private dreams and goals, to dress and act as masculine as they wanted to, and to shun any ideas of universal beauty or happiness in pursuit of their own private desires, the LESS happy they were.</p>
<p>From the paper’s abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>By many objective measures the lives of women in the US have improved over the past 35 years, yet we show that measures of subjective well-being indicate that women’s happiness has declined both absolutely and relative to men.  The paradox of women’s declining relative well-being is found across various datasets, measures of subjective well-being, and is pervasive across demographic groups and industrialized countries.  Relative declines in female happiness have eroded a gender gap in happiness in which women in the 1970s typically reported higher subjective well-being than did men.  These declines have continued and a new gender gap is emerging–one with higher subjective well-being for men.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Life In Saudi Arabia</h3>
<p>If you listen to Western propaganda, you believe that America is at the forefront of helping women by allowing them to vote, paying them the same as men, regardless of their performance, encouraging them to enter the workforce, giving them special advantages with divorce laws, and offering them the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/70990/how-psychology-destroyed-a-catholic-convent">opportunity to be lesbians</a>, or men, or invalids, or whatever they want to do.</p>

<p>But let’s examine why there are such strict rules in place for women in places like Saudi Arabia, supposed ground zero for women’s unhappiness.  In Saudi culture, women are required to have a male guardian or chaperone with them when in public.  Driving a car alone is prohibited because it increases the chances of socializing with men, and eventually losing their virginity, and therefore ruining their chances of a happy marriage (see: every other culture on earth which has allowed women to comingle with men, ever). Is this a crazy idea?</p>
<h3>Similar courtship rules throughout history</h3>
<p>Despite what you have heard, the idea of romantic love and choosing who you will marry is a VERY new idea, really taking off in the West during the Victorian Era (1837-1901). Before that time, almost all marriages were arranged by the parents, and marriages occurred very early, girls as young as 12 and boys as young as 17 (note that even then a five year age difference minimum was enforced).</p>
<p>The man received a payment from the bride’s family known as a dowry in order to help care for her. A non-virginal woman would not only never be chosen for marriage, she was actually prohibited to marry in most Christian orders. A virginal woman was absolutely required or else she became a spinster dependent on her parents for the rest of her life.</p>

</div>
<p>In the Victorian Era, what many consider the peak of Western civilization, romantic love became an option for some. However, strict rules remained in place during courtship. After meeting a woman, it was not appropriate for the man to speak to her for a period of some time. Courting took place exclusively at the girl’s home, and always under the watchful eye of the parents.</p>
<p>The closest most couples got to an un-chaperoned date was sitting together on the front porch, with the girl’s parents indoors, which was allowed by the family once the man was approved. One can imagine that if cars were common in this era, women certainly would have been prohibited to travel in them alone. We have seen plenty of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/46543/women-should-save-their-virginity-for-marriage">evidence why women should save their virginity for marriage</a>. And yet feminism throws all this out the window.</p>
<p>Up until a couple of years ago, I would have called myself a feminist. Sure, I like women, and if they want to be free to pursue whatever dream they have, you go girl! It’s the standard narrative we’re taught in the West that women suffered for all these years under the white man’s oppression, and only now are they finally earning the freedom and equality they deserve.</p>
<h3>Women Really Were Happier Before They Were Liberated</h3>
<p>But, what if there is a reason that virginity is universally valued throughout the world in all cultures, that rules and customs for behavior between the sexes existed throughout history, and that religion and other institutions were established to have women subservient to men? What if women were actually happier when they didn’t have to worry about writing TPS reports, multitasking, balancing a budget, and finding emotional fulfillment?</p>

<p>As Norah Vincent discovered in her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Womans-Year-Disguised/dp/0143038702/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1443498737&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Self+Made+Man&amp;tag=rok0f-20">Self Made Man</a></em>, where she spent one year living as a man, females are very unhappy when living a masculine life.</p>
<p>Over the past 30 years, women’s education levels have risen and then surpassed men, contraception offered them control over fertility and allowed them to freely have premarital sex, technology and modern appliances have taken over many domestic duties, women have made huge advances in the workforce, and in many cases out-earn men. Social changes have accepted lesbianism, out-of-wedlock births, trannys, tattoos, piercings and neon hair.</p>
<p>And yet, the study shows that women’s unhappiness increased by the <em><strong>same amount as an 8.5% increase in the published government unemployment rate</strong></em>. In other words, the level of unhappiness women experienced would be the same the general population experienced if the U3 unemployment rate went from its current 5.1% to 13.6%.</p>

<p>If feminism is not making women any happier, what is the point?  It has already resulted in fatter, less pleasant, sluttier, uglier, less loyal women which makes men very unhappy. But if it’s demonstrably destroying the family unit while also clearly making women themselves miserable, shouldn’t it be thrown out tomorrow and the patriarchy restored?</p>

Bringing us all down.</p>
</div>
<p>As Roosh pointed out <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/city-life-is-a-simulation">recently</a>, an advanced, first world, modern society may not lead to happiness. Indeed, if we examine the Gross National Happiness, a phrase coined in 1972 by Bhutan’s King, who balanced every modern invention with the overall impact it would have on his people, we find that first world nations score poorly.</p>
<h3>Spiraling Further Downwards</h3>
<p>The study found the LOWEST satisfaction rates for the following questions for women: “How satisfied are you with:”</p>
<ol>
<li>Your friends and people you spend time with</li>
<li>The amount of fun you are having</li>
<li>The way you spend your leisure time</li>
<li>The way you get along with your parents</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, basic things every human being on the planet enjoys. Is it any wonder that <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/25-percent-of-american-women-are-mentally-ill">so many American women are mentally ill</a>?</p>
<p>The causes of these 4 problems are easily seen when the same women are asked what they value most highly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Being successful in my line of work</li>
<li>Making a contribution to society</li>
<li>Having lots of money</li>
<li>Being able to find steady work</li>
</ol>
<p>OK I’ll give them #2, a fulfilling life is universally desirable, but the rest are valueless rat race goals that will only continue to deny them the four major grievances above.</p>
<h3>Embrace Neomasculinity</h3>
<p>Embrace neomasculinity and women who support it. Feminism is causing irreversible damage in the West, and many women are beginning to question it.  Their voices should be applauded and echoed so others can join the movement to end this disease.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, a group of women organized a campaign called “My Guardian Knows What’s Best For Me” (reminds me of the old American TV Show Father Knows Best). These women demanded “punishments for those who call for equality between men and women, mingling between men and women in mixed environments, and other unacceptable behaviors.”</p>
<p>Further, they are pushing for sex segregation in malls and hospitals, the only two public places where segregation currently does not exist.  The only places men and women work together are medical colleges, some hospitals and some banks. One organizer states</p>
<blockquote><p>The image in the West is that we are dominated by men, but they always forget the aspect of love. People who aren’t familiar with Shariah often have the wrong idea. If you want stability and safety in your life, if you want a husband who takes care of you, you won’t find it except in Islam.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s work to make sure that’s no longer the case.</p>
<h3>Shaming</h3>
<p>If feminism is a failure for both men and women, then the only logical conclusion is that every patriarchal society was <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/women-must-have-their-behavior-and-decisions-controlled-by-men">correct</a>.  What can we do?  While some argue that life is better overseas and that the West is a lost cause (and I will not disagree), whenever we encounter younger impressionable women we should shame and educate them that their career, snarkiness, sarcasm, and educational degree is of zero value to men.</p>
<p>If you have younger females in your family, stress this to them. And any time a woman mentions her job, degree, or other silly pursuit we should point out that scientifically speaking, this will only make her more unhappy, and she’d be better off watching an episode of Julia Child or learning a musical talent.  The logic and reason behind this will be ignored, but the shaming and masculine scolding will make an impression on her.</p>
