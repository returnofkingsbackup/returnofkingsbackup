<p>Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) specialize in creating faux rage incidents to further their agenda. This usually involves selecting an “injustice” and targeting the source of the “injustice.” The firing of renowned scientist Tim Hunt was a good example of faux rage. The supposed injustice was Hunt’s alleged chauvinistic comments. It didn’t matter that Hunt was merely joking. The SJWs were not satisfied until the man lost his job.</p>
<p>The latest faux rage incident involves a 14-year-old Texas boy named Ahmed Mohamed. The story is that Ahmed “invented” a clock in a small suitcase. It doesn’t sound like the clock was associated with a school assignment—Ahmed indicated that he just wanted to impress a teacher.</p>
<p>According to the <em>New York Times</em>, Ahmed took his clock to an engineering teacher who said it was nice, but advised him to not show it to any other teachers. Later, the clock alarm went off during English class. The teacher mistakenly thought the “invention” could be a bomb. The police were called and they arrested the boy.</p>
<p>According to the local ABC affiliate, <a href="http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/local/dallas-county/2015/09/15/irving-isd-student-detained-for-device-resembling-bomb/72339246/">WFAA</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Officers said Ahmed was being “passive aggressive” in his answers to their questions, and didn’t have a “reasonable answer” as to what he was doing with the case. Investigators said the student told them that it was just a clock that he was messing around with. “We attempted to question the juvenile about what it was and he would simply only say it was a clock. He didn’t offer any explanation as to what it was for, why he created this device, why he brought it to school,” said James McLellan, Irving Police.</p></blockquote>
<p>After an investigation proved that the device was indeed a clock and not a bomb, police released Ahmed.</p>
<p>But that is not the end of the story. The Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) got involved and claimed that the incident represented a case of religious and racial discrimination. CAIR spokesperson Alia Salem said: “I think this wouldn’t even be a question if his name wasn’t Ahmed Mohamed.”</p>
<h3>The Outpouring of Sympathy</h3>

<p>The SJWs became completely unhinged, even by leftoid standards, in response to the alleged racism of the incident. The media, major corporations, MIT, and even President Obama gullibly swallowed the narrative supplied by CAIR without bothering to investigate the whether the details were true.</p>
<p>Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, an astrophysicist with MIT and someone who should have shown a bit more skepticism, invited Ahmed to tour the MIT campus. She added, “You [Ahmed] are the kind of student we want at places like MIT and Harvard.”</p>
<p>Microsoft provided a box of expensive goodies. Judging by the picture, the goodies include a $999 3D printer and a $968 Surface Pro 3 bundle:</p>

<h3>A Sorry Invention</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-71256 " title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IStandWithAhmed.jpg" alt="IStandWithAhmed" width="394" height="245" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IStandWithAhmed.jpg 640w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IStandWithAhmed-300x187.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IStandWithAhmed-262x163.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IStandWithAhmed-574x357.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 394px) 100vw, 394px"></p>
<p>While the mainstream media and other big name players accepted the narrative that little Ahmed was a victim of the horrible Christian bigots in Texas, people on social media and alternate news outlets were more skeptical.</p>
<p>The nature of Ahmed’s “invention” triggered the most skepticism. Even a casual glance at the device shows that it doesn’t really look like a clock. Rather, it looks like someone was trying to make a device that looked like a bomb—at least the kind of bomb that we are familiar with from the movies.</p>
<p>It gets worse. Some people have taken the trouble to <a href="http://blogs.artvoice.com/techvoice/2015/09/17/reverse-engineering-ahmed-mohameds-clock-and-ourselves/">reverse engineer</a> the “invention” and it appears that t<em><strong>he only thing Ahmed did was take a Radio Shack clock from the 1980s, remove it from its case, and reassemble it in a pencil box.</strong></em> Here is the difficult work that Ahmed had to do:<br>
<iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/kHk_6Vh4Qeo.html" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In other words, this was not really an invention at all—and therefore not something that anyone could be particularly proud of. Was Ahmed really trying to show of the brilliance of his clock? Or was he trying deliberately to cause a media sensation?</p>
<h3>A Controversial Father</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-71259" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2C6E262700000578-3238709-image-a-26_1442507913148-300x225.jpg" alt="2C6E262700000578-3238709-image-a-26_1442507913148" width="300" height="225" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2C6E262700000578-3238709-image-a-26_1442507913148-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2C6E262700000578-3238709-image-a-26_1442507913148-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2C6E262700000578-3238709-image-a-26_1442507913148-574x431.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/2C6E262700000578-3238709-image-a-26_1442507913148.jpg 634w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The case for it being a deliberate attempt to cause media sensation is strengthened when you consider that Ahmed’s father, Mohamed Elhassan Mohamed, has a history courting controversy.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Washington Post described the father as:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A] native of the Sudan who is now an American citizen, likes to call himself a sheik. He wears a cleric’s flowing white robes and claims hundreds of followers throughout Egypt, Sudan and in the United States. But he is unknown as a scholar or holy man in the state he has called home for two decades. Religious leaders in Texas say they have never heard of Elhassan, including the imam at the mosque where he worships.</p></blockquote>
<p>Elhassan is a political activist who has run for President in Sudan twice. He also participated in a mock trial of the Koran staged by crackpot Florida pastor Terry Jones. The mock trial ended with the Koran being found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to be burned.</p>
<p>Jones performed the controversial burning. When asked why he would participate in the stupid mock trial, Elhassan said that he saw it as an opportunity to take his children to Disney World.</p>
<p>When you combine the facts that the clock was a dubious invention with Elhassan’s status as a known provocateur, it becomes hard to believe that this was just a case of an innocent Muslim genius who “invented” a clock. If you throw in the fact that the Council of American-Islamic Relations was involved almost immediately, it becomes more likely that this was intended to be a media hoax from its inception.</p>
<h3>SJWs unhappy that people are questioning the “invention”</h3>
<div id="attachment_71254" style="width: 235px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-71254 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPCQrtlUsAIg65I-300x400.jpg" alt="CPCQrtlUsAIg65I" width="225" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPCQrtlUsAIg65I-300x400.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPCQrtlUsAIg65I-262x349.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPCQrtlUsAIg65I-574x765.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPCQrtlUsAIg65I.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“Acknowledge Creativity, #IStandWithAhmed” Shirt reads “Don’t judge me because of my color.”</p>
</div>
<p>As you may have guessed, the SJWs are not pleased that people have begun to question the Ahmed’s story. It goes against their narrative that all Muslims are peace-loving inventors while Christians are ignorant, mouth-breathing, knuckle-dragging racist bigots.</p>
<p>This is shown by the fact that the leading progressive think-tank, Think Progress, took time out to accuse people who are questioning Ahmed’s story as being guilty of “<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/09/20/3703542/the-smear-campaign-against-ahmed-mohamed/">smearing</a>” the boy.</p>
<h3>Why should SJWs care?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-71255" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.45.43-AM-300x277.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-09-21 at 11.45.43 AM" width="300" height="277" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.45.43-AM-300x277.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.45.43-AM-837x773.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.45.43-AM-667x616.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.45.43-AM-262x242.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.45.43-AM-574x530.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-11.45.43-AM.png 1176w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The real question is why would anyone want to construct a narrative that white American Christian troglodytes are unjustly persecuting Muslims? I can think of a few reasons:</p>
<p><strong>It’s part of the bigger narrative.</strong> The larger narrative is that Americans are the most oppressive people on the planet. Americans have oppressed blacks (through slavery and Jim Crow laws), Japanese (through WWII internment), Chinese (through discriminatory laws), and Hispanics (I don’t know how). Thus, Americans need to be punished and replaced with better people.</p>
<p><strong>It serves to rehabilitate Islam.</strong> Muslims get a bad rap in the US because most of the terrorist acts perpetrated in the last 20 years have been Islamic in origin. If you can show that Muslims actually provide a positive contribution, it improves Islam’s image. Bonus points if you imply that Christians are bigots while doing it.</p>
<p><strong>It divides Americans.</strong> It is no secret that the Democratic Party gets its votes in part through fanning the flames of racial discord. If Black Americans and Muslim Americans feel that the white majority is persecuting them, they are more likely to vote for Hillary.</p>
<p><strong>It will make the next terrorist attack easier.</strong> Whether this was an intended goal or not, this incident will facilitate future terrorist attacks. The next time a Muslim student brings what looks like a bomb to school, the teacher who discovers the device will need to make a decision: Should he call the police and risk being publicly shamed as a racist xenophobic shitlord? Or should he suppress his natural fear and hope that it is just another example of Islamic inventive genius?</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ahmed’s clock represents a partial victory for sane people. We were able to successfully question the narrative supplied by the SJWs. I say it is a partial victory because the debunking of the incident was only done by alternate news outlets, bloggers, and by people on social media. However, most people will never hear about the details of story.</p>
<p>For them, the narrative remains—a bunch of stupid Texans persecuted a little Muslim boy for inventing a clock.</p>
