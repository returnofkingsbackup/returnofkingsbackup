<p>Having practiced game for a few years now, I’m fairly confident that I’ve just about maxed out on my SMV. I’ve slept with a good number of females in the upper echelon of aesthetic beauty, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/67862/5-universal-truths-about-perfect-10s-every-man-should-know" target="_blank">including a handful of 10s</a>, and have managed to steer clear of the pitfalls caused by said women that sap men financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>However, when thinking back on past ONSs, relationships, short to long term trysts, and everything in between, it became clear to me that there are quite a few tenets that are flawed with regards to achieving (alleged) fidelity with the fairer sex.</p>
<p>They had shown themselves to me over the last few years and even a couple of times during my beta days, but not consistently enough for me to put my finger on it. But they are there nonetheless and here are the first two that stuck out to me.</p>
<h3>Dread Game</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="" src="../vccoordinator.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sad-female-face.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="296"></p>
<p>If you’re familiar with red pill game you’re aware of what we call “dread game.” Dread game is loosely defined as completely disappearing by cutting off all contact from a girl who is engaging in unacceptable behavior such as flaking, bitchiness, and the like.</p>
<p>The purpose of going off the grid is to make it clear to the girl that you can and will walk at any time. The idea is that longer you maintain radio silence, the more she dreads that you are gone for good. Her emotions, ego, and insatiable need for drama are all activated.</p>
<p>When this happens all she can think about is you and the possibility that you could be with another woman which sends her into a frenzy that manifests itself into endless calls and texts begging you to “just call or text” her so that the two of you can “talk and work this out.”</p>
<p>Most of the time dread game is highly effective but here’s the flaw: <strong>Most girls have more options than we do…<em>especially the good looking ones.</em></strong></p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="../mom.girlstalkinsmack.com/image/082012/Why%20Date%20Just%20One%20Man_1.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="338"></p>
<p>No matter how many girls a man has in his phone that he could text and have there at a moment’s notice, you can bet your ass that each and every one of those girls has at least twice as many dudes she could contact who would be more than willing to come and bang her brains out in three words or less from her.</p>
<p>One girl I was fucking a while back got stupid and threw a fit about something I was or wasn’t doing (I can’t remember what it was but it was probably silly) and decided to cancel our meetup we’d planned for the next day. So I cut off contact with her for a few days.</p>
<p>She called and texted constantly for the first day and a half but after that she, too, went radio silent. A couple days later she texted me and said she was sorry for being a brat and that she’d like to meet up for a makeup fuck. I agreed, met up, and proceeded to let her drain my balls.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished, right?</p>
<p>Maybe, but not so fast. Her phone was buzzing the entire night from what were no doubt text messages from other guys. It didn’t bother me in the least because I had never considered her for anything other than a fuck doll (I fucked her on our first “date”) and my territorial instinct never kicks in for sluts.</p>
<p>The point is that if you run dread game for too long, a woman could assume that you’re no longer interested, which badly bruises their fragile egos. The need to assuage their egos overwhelms them so they grab their phones or jump on Tinder to find a guy who will reaffirm their attractiveness and desirability.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="" src="../realchristianmcqueen.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/girl-texting-on-cell-phone.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="289"></p>
<p>The opposite <em>could</em> be true, but given the state of the sexual marketplace in the West, it’s probably not…at least most of the time. If you don’t give a shit about the girl it doesn’t matter what she does or who she does it with during your blackout period. So long as she puts her pussy on a platter for you when you start talking again, it’s all good.</p>
<p>So what’s a man to do if a girl he actually likes acts up? If dread game can backfire how do you correct her bad behavior?</p>
<p>Simple. Run dread game <strong>but don’t overdo it.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than cutting off all contact for two or three or more days at a time, cut her off for <em>hours</em> at a time. If she texts you wait a few hours before texting back and when you do make sure your texts are short and sweet. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Her</strong>: Hey what are you up to? [11:44 AM]</p>
<p><strong>You</strong>: busy day [07:01 PM]</p>
<p>You can put your own spin on it, but so long as you keep it short and vague and wait for a few hours before you respond you will illicit feelings of dread within her. The response above will most assuredly compel her to text you back almost immediately and ask you what your busy day consisted of because she’s fishing for anything that has to do with another chick.</p>
<p>This approach accomplishes almost the same dread as a two day absence would, but will also keep her from spiraling out of your orbit on the assumption that you may have moved on.</p>
<p>Matt Forney wrote an article titled <em><a href="http://mattforney.com/women-sex-within-24-hours-breaking/" target="_blank">All Women Have Sex Within 24 Hours Of Breaking Up With You</a></em> and it is 1000% true. The fact is that if you let too much time go by before contacting your girl she’ll “break up” with you in her own mind and make her way between the sheets with another man. Count on it.</p>
<p>Again, if she’s a slut bucket you don’t give a shit about, cool. Run standard dread game and let the good times roll. But if you actually like the girl and want to keep her around for a while <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/66532/can-a-man-ever-have-too-much-game" target="_blank">don’t <strong>over</strong> game her</a>. Rather, completely withdraw your attention from her for a few hours and make her earn it back little by little.</p>
<p>Huge difference between the dread game you run on sluts and dread game you run on girls you want to keep around.</p>
<h3>Pre-Selection</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>A standard tenet of game is that women don’t want a man that other women don’t want. You could be as ugly as homemade sin but if you’ve got an attractive female with you, your SMV always spikes. This will send their hamsters into overdrive wondering if you’re rich, great in the sack, or if you have high social status.</p>

<p>The above excerpt was taken from my article <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/64829/9-benefits-of-having-female-friends" target="_blank">9 Benefits Of Having Female Friends</a>. In that article, I included screen shots of a text conversation I had with a girl after number closing her.</p>

<p>If you take a look at our exchange via text you saw her initial hesitation to get together on account of having my on-and-off FWB with me when I approached her (my FWB was in another aisle when I opened her, but she later saw us together in the checkout line).</p>
<p>I passed her shit test with flying colors and ended up closing the deal the night we met up. Pre-selection worked like a charm in that case as it had many times before. However, this can sometimes work against you—especially <em>after</em> you’ve started fucking her.</p>
<h4><strong>Example 1:</strong></h4>
<p>A girl I had been seeing for a couple of weeks stopped texting all of a sudden. I figured it was because she’d met someone else or just wasn’t interested anymore so I didn’t sweat it. It’s all part of the game.</p>
<p>A few weeks later I ran into her at a get together at a mutual friend’s house. We briefly exchanged pleasantries and went our separate ways. After all, we’d only hooked up a few times so neither of us started to develop any sort of feelings for one another.</p>
<p>Later that night I was outside smoking when she came out and lit one up herself. We engaged in a little more small talk until she broached the subject of our little fling:</p>
<p>Her: “So I guess you’re wondering why I stopped calling.”</p>
<p>Me: &lt;shoulder shrug&gt; “Hadn’t really thought about it….figured you lost interest.”</p>
<p>Her: “No, that’s not what it was.”</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders again and took another drag.</p>
<p>Her: “I saw a picture of you and so-and-so at your place on Facebook. I kinda looked at her page and I saw that she tags you in a lot of pictures and I didn’t see any other guys on her page so I thought she was your girlfriend or something.”</p>
<p>She went on to explain that she didn’t need any drama in her life because she’d “been there and done that” and didn’t want to fuck with a dude who had a girlfriend.</p>
<h4><strong>Example 2:</strong></h4>
<p>A woman who works at a company whose building is next to the one I work in caught my attention back in January. She was a petite blonde with a great body and <em>huge</em> tits. She was definitely past the wall and probably headed toward <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/61018/7-myths-you-need-to-know-about-cougars" target="_blank">cougardom</a>. But her face was pretty enough for me to attempt to add her to my trophy mantle even if she looked to be pushing 40.</p>
<p>We met up a couple of times for drinks and the conversation and flirtation flowed nicely. I managed to get her back to my place twice where things physically escalated, but on both occasions I couldn’t close the deal.</p>
<p>Again, this was no big deal…nobody bats a thousand. I was certain to get a third opportunity where I would most assuredly penetrate that poon, so I attempted to set up another date:</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde1.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-71897" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde1-300x500.jpg" alt="blonde1" width="180" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde1-300x500.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde1-262x436.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde1.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a> <a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde2.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-71898" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde2-300x500.jpg" alt="blonde2" width="180" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde2-300x500.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde2-262x436.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde2.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a> <a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde3.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-71899" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde3-300x500.jpg" alt="blonde3" width="180" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde3-300x500.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde3-262x436.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/blonde3.jpg 338w" sizes="(max-width: 180px) 100vw, 180px"></a></p>
<p>Once again I was burned by pre-selection. I’m pretty sure Blondie here checked out my page shortly after I got the digits, as all girls normally do to make sure you are who you present yourself to be. But it was obvious that she continued to do so, and when she saw pictures of me with other chicks she decided to eject.</p>
<p>These are the only two instances that I know of where being around attractive women negatively affected the outcomes of my dealings with the second sex. What both of those situations had in common is that it didn’t become a problem for either one of them until <em>after</em> I had gotten physical with them.</p>
<p>Pre-selection works wonders <em>before</em> you hook up, but “post-selection” can and will burn you if you don’t take the necessary measures to avoid your current stable from witnessing your exploits with other girls.</p>
<p>Personally I’ve taken to putting my phone in airplane mode on occasion, deactivating my Facebook account for days at a time, and most importantly, set my account to notify me when someone tries to tag me which gives me the option whether or not I want it to appear on my feed.</p>
<p>There are other things you can do to keep from throwing salt into your own game but those three work for me.</p>
<p>Pre-selection certainly has its merits and works to a man’s advantage much more often than not. But some girls react poorly to seeing pictures of you with attractive women or getting texts at all hours of the night.</p>
<p>Sure, it may evoke feelings of dread and compel her to step up her game and increase her worth to you as is the case most of the time. But there are females who don’t want to feel like they’re constantly competing for your attention. They’re rare to be sure, but they’re out there…trust me.</p>
<h3>In The End…</h3>
<p>…these two game principles are a staples in a red pill male’s arsenal for a reason. That reason is that the overwhelming majority of the time, they work very well when applied accordingly.</p>
<p>But like I said earlier, there are exceptions to the rule. It’s better to be prepared for what will happen most of the time but if you really want to realize your full potential in terms of notches it would behoove you to keep these alternative techniques at the ready should a situation warrant deployment.</p>
<p>My next article will detail two more game doctrines that I have also found have minor deficiencies in.</p>
