<p>Our global elites are generally very good at hiding their plans for the unwashed masses—those of us who are not blessed with immense wealth and power. They are good, but sometimes even these demigods slip up and the truth about their plans comes out.</p>
<p>We just had that happen on September 27<sup>th</sup> when German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg were caught having a side conversation on a hot mic at a United Nations luncheon.</p>
<p>Merkel was complaining to Zuckerberg about posts by Facebook users who were critical to the hordes of Muslim migrants who are flooding Germany and other European countries. Zuckerberg <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/09/27/angela-merkel-caught-on-hot-mic-pressing-facebook-ceo-over-anti-immigrant-posts.html">responded</a> that:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[W]e need to do some work” on curtailing anti-immigrant posts about the refugee crisis. “Are you working on this?” Merkel asked in English, to which Zuckerberg replied in the affirmative before the transmission was disrupted.</p></blockquote>
<p>What pretense will Facebook use to ban Germans from legitimately discussing the policy concerns of their country, which purports to be a democracy? <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-26/merkel-confronts-facebook-s-zuckerberg-over-policing-hate-posts">Racism</a>, of course:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are committed to working closely with the German government on this important issue,” Debbie Frost, a spokeswoman for Menlo Park, California-based Facebook, said via e-mail. “We think the best solutions to dealing with people who make <strong>racist and xenophobic comments</strong> can be found when service providers, government and civil society all work together to address this common challenge.</p></blockquote>
<p>But can a true democracy exist when the public, who are supposed to be ultimate authority for the government, are not permitted to frankly debate policies?</p>
<h3>George Soros demands Europe take in one million Muslims annually</h3>
<div id="attachment_71677" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-71677" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Migrant_crisis-300x195.jpg" alt="Migrant_crisis" width="500" height="326" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Migrant_crisis-300x195.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Migrant_crisis-262x171.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Migrant_crisis-574x374.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Migrant_crisis.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Migrants disembark from a ship in Italy. It is sold as a Syrian crisis, but it seems like an open invitation for any Muslims who wish to invade. And where are their women?</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes our global elites are very clear about their plans, but we are <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/why-i-dont-use-the-phrase-conspiracy-theory">conditioned</a> to think that conspiracy theories are just for kooks—so we ignore these clear statements.</p>
<p>A recent example of this is an <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rebuilding-refugee-asylum-system-by-george-soros-2015-09">opinion piece</a> written by billionaire George Soros. In it, Soros states the EU must accept “at least” one million Muslims annually, and it must provide each “asylum seeker” $16,800 per year to cover housing, health care, and education costs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Soros argues that the EU must step up funding to Islamic countries, even though many of those countries are not taking any “refugees” in response to the Syrian crisis.</p>
<p>Soros goes on to criticize Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose tough stance on rejecting immigration, Soros says:</p>
<blockquote><p>[S]ubordinates the human rights of asylum-seekers and migrants to the security of borders, threatens to divide and destroy the EU by renouncing the values on which it was built and violating the laws that are supposed to govern it.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Fighting Homogeneity</h3>

</div>
<p>The plan to flood Europe with Muslims is not new. Back in 2012, Irish businessman and Bilderberg Group attendee Peter Sutherland told the House of Lords that the leadership of the European Union needs to “do its best to undermine” the “homogeneity” of its member states.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to undermine the homogeneity of European nations? Sutherland would claim that diversity somehow makes organizations and countries stronger. To prove this, advocates of diversity usually display polls of “diversity officers” from different companies who, not surprisingly, say that diversity does make organizations more effective.</p>
<p>But there is no actual proof that diversity, which in this context means introducing Muslims from the Middle East and Africa into the white nations of Europe, makes organizations more efficient. If it did, you would hear nations like China, Israel, Japan, and South Korea lining up to get their share of Islamic migrants. But those nations seem to be perfectly happy keeping their nations homogeneous.</p>
<p>The idea of resettling millions of Muslim migrants is deeply unpopular with the populations of the EU countries, but this is not going to stop the bureaucrats in Brussels from proceeding with their plans. Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, recently said that the EU’s leaders “do not care about the political cost” because they are not elected.</p>

<h3>Pope Francis’ positions undermine Christianity in Europe</h3>
<div id="attachment_71679" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-71679 " src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CNwNSLTWEAAomZr.jpg" alt="CNwNSLTWEAAomZr" width="420" height="280" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CNwNSLTWEAAomZr.jpg 599w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CNwNSLTWEAAomZr-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CNwNSLTWEAAomZr-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CNwNSLTWEAAomZr-574x382.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Camp of the Saints</p>
</div>
<p>The Catholic Church has historically been a bulwark in preserving the Christian culture of Europe. It was the Catholic faith that inspired the Crusades, the Reconquista, and the Battles of Lepanto and Vienna. Even as modern Europeans have abandoned their faith in Christ in exchange for a comfortable socialism, the Catholic Church has not stopped trying to rouse them from their slumber.</p>
<p>But Pope Francis’ position on the migrant crisis threatens to further weaken Europe’s already wobbly spiritual foundation rather than strengthen it. Francis issued a broad appeal to every parish and monastery to take in at least one “refugee” family.</p>
<p>Francis’ reason for doing this is ostensibly obedience to the Gospel:</p>
<blockquote><p>Facing the tragedy of tens of thousands of refugees—fleeing death by war and famine, and journeying towards the hope of life—the Gospel calls, asking of us to be close to the smallest and forsaken. To give them a concrete hope.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea that we should not oppress the alien among us is certainly part of the teaching of the Christian faith. The Bible states: “You shall not oppress a resident alien; you know the heart of an alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.” But this doesn’t mean that Christians are obligated to accept what amounts to an invasion by Muslim migrants.</p>
<p>The actual Catholic teaching on immigration, provided by Thomas Aquinas, is much more complex than Pope Francis’ public statements would lead us to believe. Like the Jews in the Old Testament, Christians are to recognize that people from certain nations are more likely to be a good fit as immigrants. However, immigrants from nations who have proven to enemies of Christians should not be allowed to immigrate, but to be “held as foes in perpetuity.” (cf. <em>Summa Theologica</em> I-II, Q. 105, Art. 3).</p>
<h3>Why do the global elites want an Islamic invasion of Europe?</h3>
<div id="attachment_71671" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-71671 " src="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPNHvwnWwAAfjVY.jpg" alt="CPNHvwnWwAAfjVY" width="420" height="249" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPNHvwnWwAAfjVY.jpg 590w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPNHvwnWwAAfjVY-300x178.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPNHvwnWwAAfjVY-262x155.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CPNHvwnWwAAfjVY-574x341.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Peaceful Migrants</p>
</div>
<p>I suspect that the biggest reason that the global elites want to flood Europe with Islamic immigrants is that they place no value on culture—they view human beings purely as economic units. If Europeans are not reproducing at the rate necessary to sustain the current welfare state, then importing young, vibrant Muslim men who do want to reproduce will solve the problem.</p>
<p>Other people, like Pope Francis, are likely driven by Christian teachings of helping one’s neighbor. However, these people are naively ignoring other considerations such as the continued safety and existence of European peoples.</p>
<p>Finally, other elites may view the destruction of European culture as a punishment for Europe’s past “sins” such as its cultural hegemony. These individuals are fueled by irrational self-hatred.</p>

<p>During the Battle of Vienna, the grand vizier of the invading Ottoman Turks sent an emissary to deliver a summons of surrender to the city. The summons read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Accept Islam and live in peace under the Sultan! Or deliver up the fortress and live in peace under the Sultan as Christians; and if any man prefer, let him depart peaceably, taking his goods with him. But if you resist the Will of Allah, then death or spoliation or slavery shall be the fate of you all! Fight and you die! Surrender and you live!</p></blockquote>
<p>The military governor of Vienna, Count Ernst Rüdiger von Starhemberg, told the crowd of people gathered near the town’s Cathedral:</p>
<blockquote><p>The infidels promise us that if we surrender, all Christians will be allowed to remain Christian. But, ask the Greeks what that promise means. Ask the Serbs. Ask the Albanians. How do the people of Vienna reply to that invitation?</p></blockquote>
<p>The crowd immediately responded with a shout “No!”</p>
<p>May the men of Europe find the same courage as their ancestors and resist the demands of the global elite to sacrifice their nations.</p>
