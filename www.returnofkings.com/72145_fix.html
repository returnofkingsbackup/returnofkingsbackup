<p>A solution of <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-neomasculinity" target="_blank">neomasculinity</a> has been proposed by Roosh V to the problems that ail our society. It is a comprehensive work backed by credible citations, and as one commenter quipped, “required reading for the modern man.”</p>
<p>Although neomasculinity is perhaps morally and scientifically sound, we are still left wondering if it is even possible to implement within our lifetimes to help ensure the happiness and security of our offspring. It perhaps is, but it would be a monumental task requiring massive organization, time, planning, and balls.</p>
<p>I propose that rather than relying on anecdotal tactics, let’s turn to the master of war tactics himself, Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu’s <em>The Art of War</em> could serve as a practical guide to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">legal</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">nonviolent</span> policy implementation. It is required reading for military generals and businessmen alike. Because of the enormity of this task, for now I’d like to examine only the first of thirteen chapters, called “Laying Plans.” This is a pre-battle assessment of the playing field. It gives us an idea of whether or not we are a force to be reckoned with, and if not how we can improve our station.</p>
<p>In the meantime I’d recommend all readers get their hands on a hard copy of <em>The Art of War</em>. Due to the excellent commentary and nice formatting, I’ve greatly benefited from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1454911867?keywords=The%20Art%20of%20War%20Illustrated%20Edition%20fall%20river%20press&amp;qid=1444599410&amp;ref_=sr_1_fkmr0_1&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1-fkmr0" target="_blank">specific referenced book</a> in this article. However, this related <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/67824/what-is-the-best-english-translation-of-sun-tzus-art-of-war" target="_blank">ROK article by Quintus Curtius</a> is definitely worth considering before you make any purchases.</p>

</div>
<blockquote><p>The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a very straightforward introduction. No sugar coated bullshit, but rather a nugget of golden advice. We in the manosphere can no longer neglect the fact that the cultural decline will continue with exponential decay unless we begin laying plans for a nonviolent counteroffensive. With neomasculinity comes safety; with the current mainstream rhetoric and policymaking comes ruin.</p>
<p>Sun Tzu next moves on to describe five constant factors to be taken into account when laying plans for battle. I’ll examine three of these factors that I find the most practical in this context:</p>
<h4>1. “<strong>The Moral Law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.”</strong>
</h4>
<p>The beauty of Sun Tzu’s writing is that it can be applied in many different ways and still be feasible in just about any situation. As such, I’d like to replace the words “their ruler” with “neomasculine principles,” and “him” with “them.” Simply put, the moral law is our core foundation that assures harmony between all members of the movement. If we all believe neomasculine principles to be true and practical, then we are in harmony and can proceed forward. If not, we will simply collapse over relatively petty differences.</p>
<h4>2. “<strong>The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.”</strong>
</h4>
<p>This requires somewhat of a leap of faith for manosphere readers. Most of us may never personally meet Roosh V and other major contributors to ROK and other websites. It will be the responsibility of readers to band together and voice their opinions as to who can be most trusted to be the leading figures of the movement.</p>
<p>If a leader is lacking in even one of the above virtues, it could spell disaster for the movement, unless other safeguards are put into place. Remember, as long as we are all in accordance with the Moral Law stated above, many of us would be capable leaders by following the above virtues.</p>
<h4>3. “<strong>By Method and discipline are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and control of military expenditure.”</strong>
</h4>
<p>Let’s put the concept of “officers” into a little bit different context, the internet. Each manosphere website specializes in its own brand of material and advice. One of the issues I see now is that MRAs, PUAs, the Gamergate community, red pill conservatives, libertarians, MGTOWs, and neomasculinists are simultaneously offering up many different viewpoints, complaints, and occasional solutions to the problems we face.</p>
<p>I propose we all take a step back for a moment. We all share common enemies and I propose that it’s perhaps time to hash out our specific differences <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in writing</span> and find ways to either compromise certain viewpoints in favor of movement building or convince others through rational discussion and debate.</p>
<p>Either way, having a wedge between these different manosphere and conservative leaning groups is what a smart enemy would do to us! Separating an opponent’s forces is in fact a tactic of Sun Tzu. Let’s not let our enemies get away with this (if indeed it’s even a conscious attack). Let’s step up and hopefully unite more men from different camps under the same Moral Law mentioned above.</p>
<p>Secondly, let’s put the “maintenance of roads” into the context of the internet. In this nonviolent campaign, information and educational materials are the supplies that we rely on. This is yet another reason to try to unite the several “factions” of the manosphere. We need people with internet and networking experience (overall computer and web knowledge) to help protect this valuable supply route. I’ll make the assumption that in the gaming and MGTOW communities there are some brilliant men with very valuable technological skills that could help our cause, if they choose to do so by their own free will.</p>
<h3>The Core Principles</h3>
<div id="attachment_72157" style="width: 446px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3.png"><img class="wp-image-72157" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3.png" alt="Sun Tzu 3" width="436" height="354" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3.png 1076w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3-300x244.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3-837x680.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3-667x542.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3-262x213.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Sun-Tzu-3-574x466.png 574w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Here we only examine Chapter 1, Laying Plans. But 12 more chapters of tactics and strategies may be later utilized.</p>
</div>
<p>Sun Tzu continues the chapter by listing seven factors which he examines before doing battle, and he claims that <strong>By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat.</strong> Considering that Sun Tzu is to this day required reading by military generals and businessmen alike, I sincerely believe in his claim. The seven considerations are as follows:</p>
<h4>1. <strong>Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral Law?</strong>
</h4>
<p>This may currently be a toss-up, as the manosphere is currently divided into “factions” and the enemies of liberty in higher established positions seem to be united under their twisted methodology. Democrats and Republicans (mostly made up of Liberals, Progressives, RINOs, and Cuckservatives), the Supreme Court, and the Executive Branch seem to have no problem implementing culturally destructive policies. This is indeed chilling, as the destructive system and institutions in this country have become a juggernaut.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Which of the two generals has the most ability?</strong></h4>
<p>I’d like to reframe this in the context of “camps” rather than “generals,” mainly because we won’t be suiting up in armor and charging the battlefield under the ultimate command of one man. I would argue that we might just have this factor in our favor. Masculine men with strong principles who are continually seeking self-improvement may indeed be able to turn the tide, as many of our male opponents are becoming more effeminate by the day.</p>
<p>Also, most feminist “leaders” are simply a joke; they’re only taken seriously because the system backs them, not because they actually have leadership ability.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<h4>3. <strong>With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?</strong>
</h4>
<p>This is a bit more abstract, and of course was written in a time before many major scientific discoveries, theories, and scientific laws were in place. One interpretation is that Heaven and Earth represent polarities such as hot and cold, night and day, etc. But in my opinion, I think that this ties in with the Chinese philosophy of yin and yang, in which polar opposites are actually complementary and flow into one another.</p>
<p>With this interpretation, the neomasculine principle of sexual polarity seems to align quite nicely, and believers of yin and yang philosophy would most likely appreciate the neomasculine perspective of the sexes being complementary rather than being in a futile competition.</p>
<h4>4. <strong>On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?</strong>
</h4>
<p>We may be able to draw parallels between “discipline” and our current legal system, which is becoming more and more toxic to men. Through changing the definitions of words such as “rape” and “harassment,” our enemy is able to enforce discipline on the male population. As of this moment, the enemy has the power to enforce discipline upon the masses, and “open season” could be declared on our movement by SJWs and their ilk.</p>
<p>As such, it seems a necessity that a legal aspect of neomasculinity be proposed <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in writing</span>. In other words we need lawyers, law clerks, and anybody else with experience in the legal realm to help guide our cause. We must protect ourselves legally by studying the laws and examining loopholes. It is also perhaps wise to discuss the process by which we can change laws in our favor, or change the interpretation of those laws by legally resetting healthy precedents in the justice system.</p>
<h4>5. <strong>Which army is stronger?</strong>
</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, although we may be morally and scientifically correct, right now a large chunk of the general population is under hypnosis from the mainstream agenda. <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/how-patriarchy-will-return" target="_blank">Roosh has an article</a> on some possible ways to begin educating the masses and seeding resistance. If we reach the third step of “culture war” in this article, then I believe we have a better chance of success, and as such the rest of Sun Tzu’s book may be utilized to the fullest extent to achieve our objectives.</p>
<h4>6. <strong>On which side are officers and men more highly trained?</strong>
</h4>
<p>Our enemy has been at this for decades, perhaps centuries. He understands our weaknesses and has set up institutions to protect himself and defend against principled masculine men. While I agree that manosphere readers are one of the most educated groups of men in the country, until we further unite and peacefully organize I fear that we will be no match for the establishment.</p>
<h4>7.<strong> In which army is there the greater constancy in both reward and punishment?</strong>
</h4>
<p>As for punishment, refer to point number (4). As for reward, our current system is interesting and somewhat frightening at the same time. Masculine men who “step out of line” risk punishment (see Roosh V in Canada and on <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2oc1as" target="_blank">The Dr. Oz Show</a>). At the same time, women who act against their biological construct are rewarded with praise and adoration. Obese women and sluts are rewarded with positive attention and understanding (from the media, girlfriends, and of course “beta male orbiters”), instead of being educated and shamed for unhealthy behaviors.</p>
<p>Women are rewarded in divorce court through financial gain and are also awarded child custody in a majority of cases; not to mention single mothers are praised as being strong and independent, even though it’s well documented that single motherhood more often leads to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/1995/03/bg1026nbsp-the-real-root-causes-of-violent-crime" target="_blank">negative child outcomes.</a></p>
<p>To summarize, the enemy has us <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICWCMaRypI" target="_blank">by the balls</a> when it comes to unity, strength, training programs, and constancy of reward and punishment; a system in which healthy masculinity is institutionally being shamed with greater frequency, and at the same time destructive female behaviors are being rewarded. Now folks, after reading these seven considerations, it would be very naive in my opinion to assume that the enemy is not well versed in Sun Tzu’s <em>The Art of War</em>!</p>
<h3>More Insights</h3>
<p>Sun Tzu concludes the first chapter in <em>The Art of War</em> with a few more valuable insights. We’ll address a few of those here today:</p>
<blockquote><p>While heeding to the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this to be a noble gesture. In essence, if any man out there has great ideas or thoughtful insights, it would be best to fully disclose this knowledge to the manosphere and essentially go above and beyond the call of duty.</p>
<blockquote><p>All warfare is based on deception</p></blockquote>
<p>This is perhaps one of the most famous lines from the entire book. The possible tactics derived from this principle are seemingly limitless, and as such it is perhaps best to leave this point alone for now.</p>
<blockquote><p>If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Avoidance is perhaps our best bet under the current circumstances. It may be in our best interest to avoid direct confrontation with the enemy, and instead unite quietly amongst ourselves while we lay plans. If we lose our cool and attempt to butt heads with the establishment and SJWs through noisy protests, we may further alert our opponent and force him to crack down to an even greater extent.</p>
<blockquote><p>If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is well established in the manosphere that feminists and SJWs are not capable of controlling their tempers. As such, if the time comes to mount a swift, blinding, massive, nonviolent campaign we may be able to force their “feewings” and their ridiculous “hamsters” into overdrive.</p>
<p>While the elites behind the curtain may keep their cool, the public at large will be able to witness the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g67z_xBe07Q" target="_blank">massive childlike meltdown</a> of typical feminists and SJWs on a nationwide scale. This may help gather even more support from the public (which was actually a useful tactic of Che Guevara in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_Warfare_%28book%29" target="_blank">Guerrilla Warfare</a> that he eventually ignored, leading to his death). It is essential that we take our opponent’s choleric temper into consideration while laying plans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If he is taking ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand (meaning your strategy will be based upon what the enemy does)… The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all!</p>
<p>It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>There are indeed many positive conclusions that can be drawn about our camp and about our opponent’s camp as we lay our plans. That being said, it is also obvious that several factors are working against us; the main problem is that the enemies of neomasculinity and liberty are entrenched within a corrupted system and a large chunk of the general population is residing in a blue pill wonderland.</p>
<p>Until the negative aspects discovered while laying plans are deliberated and solved, it would be (in Sun Tzu’s expert opinion) a very bad decision to move further ahead in our campaign.</p>
<p>I propose we take things slowly for the time being and try not to create unnecessary waves in a corrupted system. This would only alert our opponents and cause them to react emotionally (as usual), possibly leading to further crackdowns on the Bill of Rights. It would be wise to step up recruiting efforts on the web and in our daily lives to unite the factions and begin quietly laying careful plans.</p>
<p>If and when the time comes, the nonviolent neomasculine onslaught should be so swift and stunning that the ensuing massive emotional meltdown may indeed be the enemy’s undoing.</p>
