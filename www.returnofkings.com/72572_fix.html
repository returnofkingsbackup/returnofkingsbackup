<p>In the 1970’s, a movement known as “Jewish feminism” started in the American Jewish community. It was a movement that originally sought to make Jewish woman <del>superior to</del> equal to Jewish men. One of the first major issues tackled by these feminists was the power to <del>optimize hypergamy</del> initiate divorces.</p>
<p>Perhaps these Jewish ladies were becoming jealous of the growing “liberation” of non-Jewish women in United States. Perhaps Jewish women, for cultural reasons, are more naturally attracted to the ideologies of feminism. <a href="http://forward.com/articles/2305/why-are-there-so-many-jewish-feminists/" target="_blank">Jewish writer Marjorie Ingall describes</a> how Jewish women are receptive to feminism by quoting Jewish feminist Naomi Wolf:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have a political history going back to the socialist and labor movements, where women were organizers and rabble-rousers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or perhaps many Jewish women truly were being unfairly oppressed in certain areas of life and wanted to take action.</p>

<p>A quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_feminists" target="_blank">Wikipedia search for “list of Jewish feminists”</a> brings up an admittedly incomplete list of 114 names. Most of the women listed were born in the 20th century. <a href="http://jwa.org/feminism" target="_blank">The Jewish Women’s Archive website</a> is a comprehensive website dedicated to key Jewish feminists, containing 1,193 profiles.</p>
<p>If one simply<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_feminists" target="_blank"> searches for “list of feminists” on Wikipedia</a>, the page you’re directed to contains 770 names dating all the way back to the 13th century. The most comprehensive database when searching google for “list of feminists” seems to be Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Let’s be as fair as possible here and assume that the Wikipedia list of 770 feminists contains no Jewish feminists. So let’s add the 114 Jewish feminists to this list to get a total of 884 Wikipedia worthy feminists. We then take 114 divided by 884 and multiply by 100. The percentage of Wikipedia reported feminists of Jewish descent comes to 12.9%.</p>
<p>However, this quick calculation doesn’t take into account the Jewish Women’s Archive of 1,193 noteworthy feminists of Jewish descent and assumes that none of the feminists on the Wikipedia list of 770 are Jewish (when in fact many are). Also, the list of 770 feminists dates back several hundred years, whereas the list of 114 Wikipedia Jewish feminists is mostly 20th century and beyond.</p>
<p>Jews make up 1.7-2.6% of the American population. As such, to have adequate proportional representation in the feminist movement, there would only have to be two or three Jews <strong>at most</strong> for every 100 American feminist leaders. This doesn’t seem to be the case though, at least according to a simple internet search.</p>
<p>On a related note, we also need to keep in mind that disproportionate Jewish representation is also present in the US Congress – 8.4%, the Supreme Court – 33% or 3/9 Justices, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors – confirmed 40% or 2/5 current members (Janet Yellen and Stanley Fischer are Jewish and are also the Chair and Vice-Chair of Federal Reserve Board of Governors), and higher level academia.</p>

<p>The “Jewish feminism” that started within the Jewish community seems to have become part of the bigger feminist movement taking place in America. Thus, the very small demographic of Jewish women in this country (roughly 1% of the population) seems to have a ridiculously large representation within the overall feminist movement.</p>
<p>Let’s explore <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only a few</strong></span> of these very influential feminists of Jewish descent:</p>
<h3>Prominent Feminists of Jewish Descent:</h3>
<h4>The Key Players, Radicals, And Movement Leaders:</h4>
<p><strong>Judy Blume: Born 1938.</strong> Blume is an American writer with a target audience of children and young adults, with book sales over 80 million. She has written novels about racism, menstruation, divorce (<em>It’s Not the End of the World, Just As Long As We’re Together</em>), bullying, and masturbation.</p>
<p><strong>Judith Butler: Born 1956.</strong> Butler is a “gender theorist” and a philosopher. She teaches at the University of California, Berkeley. Butler has written a book called <em>Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity</em> that was published in 1990. This book is considered the cream of the crop by many feminists when it comes to “queer theory” and “postmodern poststructural feminism” (whatever that means).</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Dworkin: 1946-2005.</strong> Many of you guys have probably heard of Dworkin. She was a radical feminist. Dworkin, among other things, was vehemently anti-porn because she said it has links to rape. This is somewhat ironic, considering there is heavy Jewish influence in the pornography industry.</p>
<div id="attachment_72573" style="width: 384px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-72573" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrea-Dworkin-300x264.jpg" alt="Andrea Dworkin" width="374" height="329" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrea-Dworkin-300x264.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrea-Dworkin-667x587.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrea-Dworkin-262x230.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrea-Dworkin-574x505.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Andrea-Dworkin.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Radical feminist Andrea Dworkin</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Shulamith Firestone: 1945-2012.</strong> Firestone was apparently schizophrenic (<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/15/death-of-a-revolutionary" target="_blank">according to a commemorative piece in The New Yorker published after her death</a>) and was also a key player in the formation of radical feminist ideals. She was the author of <em>The Dialectic of Sex: The Case For Feminist Revolution</em> which was published in 1970. This book has essentially been labeled as the boldest and clearest book ever written on radical feminism. Or, according to Naomi Wolf (another Jewish Feminist):</p>
<blockquote><p>No one can understand how feminism has evolved without reading this radical, inflammatory second-wave landmark.</p></blockquote>
<p>I certainly hope Naomi Wolf <span style="text-decoration: underline;">didn’t</span> know that Firestone was schizophrenic…</p>
<p><strong>Betty Friedan: 1921-2006.</strong> Friedan is a very big name in feminist circles. She was a leading figure of the women’s movement. She was a writer, an actor, and an ardent feminist. Friedan wrote <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, published in 1963, a book which many argue helped to spark second-wave American feminism. By the year 2000, the book had sold over 3 million copies.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Howard: 1946-2005.</strong> Howard was an important figure in setting the tone for the present day LGBT rights movement, especially when it came to organizing SJW rallies. She was a sex-positive feminist and a bisexual rights activist.</p>
<p>Manosphere readers will appreciate <a href="http://www.azquotes.com/author/42126-Tom_Limoncelli" target="_blank">a quip made on July 27th, 2005 by Tom Limoncelli</a> (a bi-sexual rights advocate):</p>
<blockquote><p>The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why Gay Pride Month is June tell them ‘A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.’</p></blockquote>
<p>If Limoncelli wasn’t clear enough as to just how much influence this woman had, how about this statement made by Brenda Howard’s partner Larry Nelson and published on June 17th, 2014 in a <a href="http://www.advocate.com/bisexuality/2014/06/17/remembering-brenda-ode-%E2%80%98mother-pride%E2%80%99" target="_blank">piece called Remembering Brenda: An Ode To the ‘Mother of Pride’</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You needed some kind of help organizing some type of protest or something in social justice? All you had to do was call her and she’ll just say when and where.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Erica Jong: Born 1942.</strong> Jong was a teacher and an author. She has been divorced three times but is now married again (this seems to be a common theme among these women). She wrote a sexually controversial book published in 1973 called<em> Fear of Flying</em> that played a big role in second-wave feminism. The book has sold over 20 million copies worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>Gloria Steinem: Born 1934. </strong>Steinem’s mother was apparently not Jewish, but even so her <a href="http://jwa.org/people/steinem-gloria" target="_blank">name pops up on the Jewish Women’s Archive website</a> if you search for it. Steinem was the leader and spokesperson for the late 60’s-early-70’s feminist movement. Interestingly, Steinem <a title="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HRUEqyZ7p8" target="_blank">admitted having ties to the Central Intelligence Agency on camera</a> (yea, the CIA of all people), but she supposedly broke her CIA ties before she became a feminist leader. You’ll have to travel further down the “rabbit hole” if you want more answers on this one.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Naomi Wolf: Born 1962.</strong> Wolf was a political advisor to Bill Clinton and Al Gore. She is an author and a journalist that has covered the topics of abortion and the Occupy Wall Street movement. Wolf has essentially become the spokeswoman of third-wave feminism (the term “third-wave feminism” was coined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Walker" target="_blank">Rebecca Walker</a>, a woman who identifies herself as black, white and Jewish) Wolf also just had to write about how Nazi Germany came to power in her book <em>The End of America</em>. If you want some entertainment, <a title="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z7nteHMPJ8" target="_blank">check out this YouTube video</a> where Wolf tries to explain “why we need feminism” but is totally destroyed on stage by anti-feminist YouTuber Karen Straughan.</p>
<h4>Jewish Feminists In The Media</h4>
<p><strong>Larisa Alexandrovna: Born 1971.</strong> Alexandrovna was managing editor of Investigative News at <em><a href="http://progressive.org/news/2014/01/186797/progressive-hires-former-raw-story-investigative-reporter-larisa-alexandrovna" target="_blank">The Raw Story</a></em> for about three years. She was a blogger for the <em>Huffington Post</em> and her own blog as well. She has reportedly had her work referenced in <em>Rolling Stone </em>magazine, <em>Vanity Fair</em>, and<em> Newsweek</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Bloom: Born 1961.</strong> Bloom is the only child of Gloria Allred (another feminist listed below in this article). She, like her mother, is an American civil rights attorney. She was the anchor on <a href="http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/lisa-bloom-leaving-trutv/23452" target="_blank">truTV’s In Session</a> from 2001-2009. Bloom is a legal analyst for <em>The Today Show</em> and also contributor to NBC<em> Nightly News</em> and MSNBC.</p>
<p><strong>Susan Estrich: Born 1952.</strong> Estrich is a political commentator for Fox News, a feminist advocate, political operative, author, professor, and a lawyer. She wrote a book published in 2005 called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FCKH92?keywords=the%20case%20for%20hillary&amp;qid=1445565279&amp;ref_=sr_1_2&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank"><em>The Case for Hillary Clinton</em>.</a> (oh, great)</p>

</div>
<h4>Jewish Feminists In Entertainment, Art, Erotica, And Pornography:</h4>
<p><strong>Mayim Bialik: Born 1975.</strong> Bialik is an American actress and also a neuroscientist. She played Dr. Amy Fowler on CBS’s <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>. This is an interesting coincidence, as an <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/71593/how-the-big-bang-theory-and-other-mainstream-sitcoms-lie-to-men" target="_blank">article was published right here on ROK</a> about the blue pill ills of <em>The Big Bang Theory</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Hanne Blank: Born 1969.</strong> Blank is a historian, writer, editor and also a public speaker. Blank has written and edited erotica in the past. She believes in “fat rights” (fat acceptance).</p>
<p><strong>Judy Chicago: Born 1939.</strong> Chicago is an artist, art educator, and does collaborative art instillation pieces of “feminist art.” She collaborated with her third husband (here we go again with the multiple husbands theme…) to create <a href="http://www.judychicago.com/gallery.php?name=Holocaust+Project+Gallery">The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light (1985-1993)</a>.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Eve Ensler: Born 1953.</strong> Supposedly, only Ensler’s father was Jewish, but she did grow up in a Jewish community and was given the Lion of Judah Award by the United Jewish Communities in 2002. Ensler is a playwright, performer, feminist and activist. She is best known for writing the famous 1996 play <em>The Vagina Monologues</em>. For any college students reading this, it wouldn’t surprise me if a rendition of <em>The Vagina Monologues</em> showed up on your campus at some point; it showed up on my campus and was hosted by the campus feminist organization in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar: Born 1977.</strong> Gellar is a producer and an actress, starring or playing supporting roles in a plethora of TV shows and movies including <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, <em>I Know What You Did Last Summer</em>, <em>Scream 2</em>, and as Daphne<em> in Scooby Doo</em> (2002).</p>

<p><strong>Nina Hartley: Born 1959.</strong> Hartley is an American author, sex educator, sex-positive feminist, pornographic film director, and American pornographic actress. She has been recognized with numerous awards throughout her career. She did an interview on “The Young Turks” and was introduced as “legendary” by Cenk Uygur. She apparently was known as “the best ass” in the business in her days of youth and specialized in lesbian scenes. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7zdMt40NzI" target="_blank">Check out her Young Turks interview on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Hartley’s case struck me as somewhat more interesting because it has been suggested by many people that the Jewish community has a powerful influence on this nation’s pornography industry. <a href="http://www.bangor.ac.uk/creative_industries/nathan_abrams.php.en" target="_blank">Dr. Nathan Abrams</a>, a Jewish Professor at Bangor University in the UK has essentially said that the Jews were the driving force behind the modern day porn industry. In fact, he even <a href="http://www.jewishquarterly.org/issuearchive/articled325.html?articleid=38" target="_blank">wrote a piece about it in <em>Jewish Quarterly</em> called “Triple-exthnics.”</a></p>

<h4>Jewish Feminists In The United States Government And Legal Realm</h4>
<p><strong>Bella Abzug: 1920-1998.</strong> Abzug was an American lawyer, U.S. Representative, social activist, and a leader of the Women’s Movement. She helped to found the <a href="http://www.nwpc.org/" target="_blank">National Women’s Political Caucus</a> with Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan. Abzug also did women’s rights work under Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p><strong>Gloria Allred: Born 1941.</strong> Allred is an American civil rights lawyer and commonly takes high profile cases. She has been involved in many women’s rights cases including representing at least seventeen women who have accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, harassment, or other misconduct.</p>
<div id="attachment_72576" style="width: 431px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

</div>
<p><strong>Shulamit Aloni: 1928-2014.</strong> Aloni was an Israeli politician and founder of the Ratz party. She was also a leader of the Meretz party and served as the Israeli Minister of Education for a year. She won the Israel Prize in 2000.</p>
<p>Although Aloni isn’t an American, I chose to include her because of the following exchange that took place in a 2002 interview with American journalist Amy Goodman; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFB0pJYO-QA" target="_blank">During this short video</a>, Aloni explains that charges of anti-Semitism are “a trick we always use” to suppress criticism of Israel coming from within the United States. If the criticism is coming from Europe, Aloni suggests that “we bring up the Holocaust.”</p>
<p><strong>Ruth Bader Ginsburg: Born 1933.</strong> Hopefully all American readers recognize this name. Ginsburg is an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, appointed by Clinton in 1993. I highly recommend all readers review <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg.htm" target="_blank">her voting record on social issues</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Elena Kagan: Born 1960.</strong> Hopefully, American readers will recognize this name as well. Kagan too is a Jewish feminist and an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

I would say that after watching this video, you must ask yourself “Is it a coincidence?”  that Spectre’s thoughts match up nicely with the views of <a href="http://www.wrj.org/" target="_blank">Women of Reform Judaism</a>, described above.</p>
<p><strong>Paula Hyman: 1946-2011.</strong> Hyman taught Jewish History at Yale University. She was the first female dean at the Seminary College of Jewish Studies at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1981 to 1986. Hyman published many feminist oriented works.</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>This has been merely a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shallow dive</span></strong> into the depths of Jewish involvement in American feminism. Sure, anybody can log on to Google and come up with all kinds of names of non-Jewish feminists (simply because non-Jews make up about 98% of the population); but I don’t see how any reasonable person can objectively deny the fact that Jews are indeed over-represented in the feminist movement.</p>
<p>In the last half-century (roughly), Jewish feminists have involved themselves in every level of American cultural infrastructure including the government, justice system, media, entertainment, education and books, and even the porn industry – verifying the information presented here and following the links of this article will make this stunningly obvious.</p>
<p>Jewish women make up roughly 1% of the entire American population; and yet a relatively large percentage of the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">most powerful and influential</span></strong> second and third-wave feminist leaders off all time are Jewish.</p>

<p>Is it simply a cultural imperative that drives so many Jewish women to take part in feminism and culturally destructive policymaking? Some would argue it may simply be a consequence of<a href="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/pellissier20110719" target="_blank"> an IQ difference </a>that drives Jews to excel and fill leadership positions<a href="http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/pellissier20110719" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<p>Others make the claim that disproportionate Jewish involvement in politics is part of a more organized conspiracy to intentionally destroy the moral fabric of mostly white, traditionally Christian societies. I’m not here to answer “the reasons why,” but rather to simply point out the obvious disproportional representation of Jews in the feminist movement.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed upon in the manosphere (at least hopefully it is by now…) that feminism is a tool that is being utilized to destroy the family unit and to get females into the work force, which generates more tax dollars and benefits corporations and politicians through mindless consumption.</p>
<p>I know this is a difficult subject for some, and can even create <a href="https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=cognitive+dissonace" target="_blank">cognitive dissonance</a>, but the reality is becoming nearly impossible to objectively deny that Jewish influence has the lion’s share of control over second and third-wave feminism, even though Jews represent only a tiny fraction of the American population.</p>
