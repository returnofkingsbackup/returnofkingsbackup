<p>How you spend the first three hours of your day is the lynchpin for how the rest of it goes. You can try blind luck as a means of maximizing your day, just hoping that flow or productivity will come your way. Or you can harness the power of these four simple methods, based on common sense divisions of different areas of your life.</p>
<p>Take what I write here as a template. Add your own ideas but always keep the core balance between the important parts of your life. You may need to set your alarm earlier and cut out more redundant activities (like TV) the night before. Commit to yourself and not <em>ESPN</em>, your PS4 or particularly your overbearing girlfriend (no, wait, you can just dump her). Your mornings need to start being more about <em><strong>you</strong></em>.</p>
<h3>1. Get to the gym… or take the gym to your home</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="" src="http://blog.citysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Stretch-for-Success.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="257"></p>
<p>Having your gym shoes and bag ready by the bed isn’t just about saving time, it’s about eliminating any possible excuses for not going to lift some weights. For those men who can guarantee 100% that they will head to the gym for a purposeful, focused session every day, other than on a legitimate rest day, good for you. For the rest of those reading this, you know what you have to do.</p>
<p>Study after study demonstrates the superiority of exercise in the morning. Whilst this ritual should not be a Gospel truth, at least 90% of men are more than physically able to get to the gym at the crack of dawn or some time before 9am. So why aren’t you?</p>
<p>For those who find an early morning workout is best done at home, invest in some moderately-priced gym equipment and make your commitment to sculpt your body each and every day. Even without gym equipment, there’s absolutely no reason for not having an <em><strong>acted-on</strong></em> daily system of bodyweight and other simple exercises (push-ups, sit-ups and the absolute <strong><em>menagerie</em></strong> of circuits and routines you can do with nothing but yourself, a few cheap free weights, a medicine ball or other <em><strong>goddamned simple</strong></em> devices).</p>
<h3>2. Read for 25 minutes to expand your mind</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="" src="../2.bp.blogspot.com/-eOvQ2QPsja8/UFMJOFRqBII/AAAAAAAAAAU/iDeUWxoGVS4/s1600/coffee-and-book.jpg" alt="" width="428" height="285"></p>
<p>If you read <em><strong>quality, masculinity-furthering</strong></em> literature for an extra 25-45 minutes each day, six days a week (just over 300 days a year) and after jumping out of bed, what sort of positive, life-sustaining outcomes are you setting yourself up for? The answer is potentially revolutionary ones.</p>
<p>Naturally, you need to take the additional step of acting on what you read (for which there are plenty of articles here on <em>ROK</em>, including my recent article <strong><em><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/71981/3-ways-to-cultivate-the-discipline-of-a-neomasculine-lifestyle">3 Ways To Cultivate The Discipline Of A Neomasculine Lifestyle</a></em></strong>). Reading is nevertheless a means of focus. We cannot always be uncovering the nefarious dealings of our SJW enemies. We need positive, self-reinforcing outlets which bring out the best in us, especially literature promoting the unleashing of your masculine mindset.</p>
<p>With just a $10 or so cost for each ebook and a Kindle device, you have access to a library probably 2,000 times bigger than what your parents and grandparents had as children and young adults. So why aren’t you taking advantage of it at the start of your day?</p>
<p>Reading is much more complicated by mid-afternoon, when the urge to lounge around, take things slower or socialize begins to take hold. By all means, socialize and relax after you’ve spent your day working in that tiny cubicle. The mornings, however, are the best times to be reading. Your mind is fresh and almost anyone you know is either sleeping or getting ready for the day.</p>
<p>If you’re not repeating something, usually you either forget it or it remains out of reach at the back of your mind. Your 25 minutes of personal investment in your own education is as much about reading new material as making sure that you revisit and apply older insights you haven’t fully taken advantage of. Reading and rereading <em>ROK</em> articles is another fabulous way to commit yourself to daily self-improvement and red pill conditioning, as is spending close to half an hour taking a look at Roosh’s collected works (or watching again his groundbreaking State of Man lecture).</p>

<h3>3. Write emails (or letters) to the people in your life you like and respect</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="" src="../media.npr.org/assets/img/2013/11/15/letter_wide-114373157624ef432f57452b56c2eb19289fd314-s6-c30.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="232"></p>
<p>Like you, I understand the imperative of time. We all get busy. But is the frenetic pace of your life really so frenetic? And frenetic enough to ignore the relationships and friendships that give so much joy to your life? What’s more is that people typically use their perceived lack of time as an excuse not to grow their number of social contacts or strengthen their rapport with existing ones. With a few simple emails, letters, calls and texts each morning, you can reverse this sort of stagnation and search for something better: positive connection, each and every day.</p>
<p>You should be keeping quality contact with a minimum of five people per morning, those five people being <strong><em>in addition to</em></strong> your family, girlfriend, booty call babe or your five closest friends. Every day, you ask? Of course, there are some common sense exceptions: you have the biggest job interview of your life, your father dies, or you’re about catch a plane to Venice. The rule of thumb, though, needs to be five a day. If you can’t do that, are you really the social lothario you mentally make yourself out or want to be?</p>
<p>This morning ritual is not just about some form of written or non-face-to-face verbal contact. It is about the sort of continuity in communication that enables subsequent face-to-face meetings to take place. Face it: most people depend on electronic communication to determine who they hang out with.</p>
<p>If you’re not conversing through these modern methods (and don’t have guaranteed regular situations where you encounter these people), you’re missing out on a potentially great new best friend, sex partner or cool social acquaintance. Just make sure this contact does not become a <em><strong>surrogate</strong></em> for real interaction with people.</p>
<h3>4. Visualize and plan your work day</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="" src="../jesusgilhernandez.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/visualize.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="282"></p>
<p>Walking into a busy work office or exam hall can trigger intense feelings. The mindset you cultivated outside work time to use during work time often flies out the window in the face of a unsatisfied boss, troublesome coworkers or unrealistic deadlines. This is why cultivating your mindset needs to be a daily and morning activity, not a weekly one or one revisited whenever a period of significant challenge or stress appears on the horizon. You choose to visualize yourself or negativity will visualize for you<em><strong>.</strong></em> Make your choice!</p>
<p>Various strategies for visualization, which often dovetail with anchoring during your work or study day, have been disseminated for years. My personal favorite is an old NLP one, where I consciously visualize a “circle of power” linked to a specific situation (such as sitting in a meeting before I make a presentation or finalizing an English to French academic translation at my desk). I attach a color to that circle of power, usually purple, and imagine that it fuels a positive performance. When the event actually comes to being in reality, I do the same thing.</p>
<p>There are many ways to do this and describing them all is not the subject of this article. Most are only five seconds of keystrokes away on a search engine for you to learn and memorize. Needless to say, you should be devoting 15 minutes of your morning to this visualization and “cerebral planning.” Focus may be hard to come by initially or or on certain days, but your attempts at this kind of mental rehearsal require genuine effort.</p>
<h3>Take the 30 Day David Garrett Challenge</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="" src="http://www.paumillan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/challenge.jpg" alt="" width="463" height="260"></p>
<p>For 30 days, approach your life like a compulsory business or work project. Commit to these four separate investments each and every morning. This will compel you to be highly judicious with your time, cutting out activities across your day so that these more important ones can take priority.</p>
<p>Thanks to cultural conditioning (read: poisoning), a well-honed dedication to neomasculine principles can seem anything but natural. This is still not an excuse.</p>
<p>Your life is in your hands and the best way to make the most of it is to make the most of your mornings, day in, day out.</p>
