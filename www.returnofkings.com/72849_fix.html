<p>After taking the red pill, one tends to become cynical. All around us there is degeneracy; in the news, on the streets, in our literature, and in our media. It’s infesting the minds of our youth, and it’s getting worse every day.</p>
<p>“Will this degeneracy ever end?” “Will we go the way of the Roman Empire?” “Will we enter into a new era, as Huxley and Orwell predicted?” These thoughts race through the minds of unplugged men at a blisteringly fast pace.</p>
<p>The truth is, we don’t know for sure what will happen, my friends. The gargantuan beast that is liberalism seems to have an endless supply of foot soldiers to do its bidding, an infinite amount of idiotic pawns, and an unfathomable amount of power. It may very well end up taking over the world, ushering in a new era of femininity…or it may usher in a new era of masculinity, as those who see the truth begin to fight back.</p>
<p>In the words of Steven Covey: “Proactive people focus their efforts on their Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about: health, children, and problems at work.” So, let us focus on the things that we can do to stop this plague of political correctness and deviant behavior; this is the only way that it will ever come to an end. Do not spend your days focusing on how horrible the monster is, but rather focus on what you can do to slay the beast.</p>
<p>Here are five things that you can start doing right now to wage war against the blight of progressivism:</p>
<h3><strong> 1. Embody masculinity</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_72851" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-72851" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Arnold-300x205.jpg" alt="Arnold" width="500" height="342" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Arnold-300x205.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Arnold-262x179.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Arnold.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“For me life is continuously being hungry. The meaning of life is not simply to exist, to survive, but to move ahead, to go up, to achieve, to conquer.” -Arnold Schwarzenegger</p>
</div>
<p>We want to eliminate all weaknesses; a major weakness is hypocrisy. Despite the leftists’ rampant contradictions, denial, and hypocrisy, they will gleefully point flaws out in us and play the victim card when we call them out on theirs. We must eliminate all of the discrepancies between what we practice and what we preach.</p>
<p>You preach about the values of masculinity, but aren’t even physically strong? Fix that. You talk about the value of confidence and integrity, but are meek and talk behind others’ backs? Fix that. You talk about the importance of game, but aren’t actively practicing it in your relationships? Fix that. Do all that you can to embody the archetypal man; not only is this good for you in and of itself, but it will also make it far more difficult for feminists to attack you.</p>
<h3><strong> 2. Take control of your finances</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_18832" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-18832" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/10/piggy-bank-on-money-lg.jpg" alt="piggy-bank-on-money-lg" width="500" height="391"><p class="wp-caption-text">“Beware of little expenses. A small leak will sink a great ship.” -Benjamin Franklin</p>
</div>
<p>You will never be a free man until you are out of debt and have your finances in order. As long as you depend on someone else for your earnings, you will never be free to say what you wish or act as you wish. Even if you’re only taking baby steps, do something; everyone has to start somewhere.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, start by getting out of debt—this in and of itself is a gargantuan task for many Americans. Create a budget: figure out how much you earn each month and how much you spend. If you’re spending more than you earn, cut back. Stop wasting a bunch of money on stupid shit like cable TV, expensive dates with women who you barely know, or your 10<sup>th</sup> pair of Nikes.</p>
<p>Once you’re out of debt, start saving money for the future; you never know when you will be blindsided. Case in point: about three years ago, I was unexpectedly hit with a false rape accusation; I had to shell out for a lawyer to avoid going to jail. This is just one of the many injustices that could easily happen to you, so start saving.</p>
<p>Once you have some money saved, start working towards becoming self-employed by generating alternative sources of income. There are many ways in which you can do this: Fiverr, day trading, freelancing, and consulting just to name a few. Do whatever you have to do to attain 100% control over your financial life.</p>
<h3><strong> 3. Don’t argue with idiots</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_72855" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-72855" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Angry-feminist-300x177.jpg" alt="Angry feminist" width="500" height="295" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Angry-feminist-300x177.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Angry-feminist-262x154.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Angry-feminist.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.” -George Carlin</p>
</div>
<p>Back when I had just begun to see the problems in our society, I felt as if I had a duty to share this knowledge, and rightly so. However, rather than making an effort to only converse about the detriments of feminism with people who are on the verge of swallowing the red pill, I tried my damnedest to convince closed-minded morons of the truth.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>I very quickly learned that it was a fool’s errand.</p>
<p>You will never convince hardcore leftists of the follies of their beliefs; they simply don’t listen to logic. Every statistic, example from history, or analytical piece of evidence that you present will be met with an emotional appeal of some sort; a plea to victimhood, framing you as an uncaring bastard, or a simple ad hominem.</p>
<p>So, rather than trying to convince brainwashed liberals why they should change, try to sway those who are on the fence to join your cause. The second that you realize somebody is having an emotional response to what you’re saying, point it out; if they acknowledge their mistake, continue your discussion. If they don’t, literally just stop talking and walk away. Some people are so entrenched in their own ideologies and thought patterns that you can do absolutely nothing to save them. Focus on saving the people that you CAN save.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Boycott everything which supports feminism, liberalism, or progressivism</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_72856" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-72856" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NFL-Feminism-300x176.jpg" alt="NFL Feminism" width="500" height="293" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NFL-Feminism-300x176.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NFL-Feminism-262x154.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NFL-Feminism-574x336.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NFL-Feminism.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“Every time you spend money, you’re casting a vote for the kind of world you want.” -Anna Lappé</p>
</div>
<p>Changing the minds of others is a great way to fight back against the scourge of liberalism. However, there comes a point where you must vote with your dollars. Hit the feminists where it hurts the most. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/72495/why-you-should-boycott-the-nfl">Stop watching the NFL</a><strong>. </strong>Don’t watch biased, liberal news stations. Rather than supporting massive conglomerates, which almost always have feminized, politically correct workplaces, buy produce from your local farmer’s market, to support hard working men in your area.</p>
<p>Instead of pirating a manosphere ebook<strong>, </strong>actually buy it so that you can play your part in creating a stronger demand for masculine literature. Cancel your membership to Planet Fitness and join a local power-lifting gym. There’s plenty of ways that you can vote with your dollars, even if you don’t have that many.</p>
<h3><strong> 5. Treat women like they should be treated</strong></h3>
<div id="attachment_72863" style="width: 534px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-72863" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Male-vs.-Female-300x228.png" alt="Male vs. Female" width="524" height="398" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Male-vs.-Female-300x228.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Male-vs.-Female-262x199.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Male-vs.-Female.png 570w" sizes="(max-width: 524px) 100vw, 524px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“A man’s word is his honor. The feminine says what it feels. A woman’s word is her true expression in the moment.” -David Deida</p>
</div>
<p>Treat women as if they’re emotional little children; they are, after all. This doesn’t mean to abuse them or treat them poorly, it simply means to acknowledge the limits of their intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>Learn what shit tests are and how to pass them. Learn how to tell when a woman wants to be kissed. Learn how women think so that you can better game them. Stand up for yourself. If a woman talks shit to you, don’t just cower away like a dog with its tail tucked between its legs. Be open with your sexuality; if you see a sexy woman, don’t hesitate to hit on her, tease her, and express the fact that you’re attracted to her with your body language and facial expressions.</p>
<p>Most importantly, however, encourage your woman to act feminine. Reward her when she is feminine, and punish her when she acts masculine (don’t take her out to dinner, don’t buy her things, express explicit verbal disapproval, or even kick her out of the house if she won’t stop).</p>
<p>In summary, we must all do our part in fighting the horde of degeneracy which is invading our once great Western culture. Some men have the power to influence politics, some have large amounts of money which they can put to use, and some run blogs. I understand that not everyone has the resources or the time to do these things. Everyone can, however, implement the five principles which I have laid before you, and for the sake of the West, I hope that you do.</p>
