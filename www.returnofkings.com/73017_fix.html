<p>The Dominican Republic is a popular place for foreigners, and one of the main reasons is that the women here are attractive and feminine. They are superior in every way to women in Western countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. The best part of all is that they are open to dating foreigners, and some even prefer foreigners.</p>
<p>But before you travel over here to meet your Dominican beauty, it’s good to gather some background information and learn the best strategies for attracting them.</p>
<h3><strong>What They Look Like</strong></h3>
<p>It’s difficult to describe what a typical Dominican girl looks like because they come in all different shapes and colors. There’s a lot of variety here which is a good thing because you will be sure to find something you like. There are black girls, white girls, and everything in between. But one thing they all have in common is that they have great bodies.</p>
<p>Their bodies develop at an early age and they usually have curves—either a small subtle curve or a much larger curve for thicker girls. They also love to show off their bodies by wearing tight clothing out in public. The only negative aspect of their looks is that most of them don’t have pretty faces.</p>

<h3><strong>How They Act</strong></h3>
<p>Of course every girl is different, but in general Dominican girls are fun, outgoing, and social. They are family oriented and spend a lot of time with their friends. They are somewhat superficial, as they really care about what others think of them. This is good in some ways, such as that they always dress up when leaving the house. You would never see them wearing sweat pants and flip flops like women from Western countries.</p>
<p>Status is important to them and they want others to know that their life is fun and exciting. This is why they take so many pictures and are constantly changing their social media profile pictures.</p>
<p>This country is somewhat racist and you can generally tell someone’s class by their skin color and also by where they hang out. The upper-class girls have lighter skin. They speak more English but they are also more stuck-up than the lower-class girls.</p>
<h3><strong>What They Want in a Man</strong></h3>
<p>Most girls are looking for a relationship. They want a guy to to provide for them and to give them attention. Age isn’t really important, as long as you aren’t ugly or completely out of shape. Money talks here. Having a nice place, a nice car, and getting bottle service in clubs makes a huge difference. Most girls prefer guys who are at least conversational in Spanish since most girls don’t speak any English at all aside from the upper-class girls.</p>
<p>And although they won’t admit it, Dominican girls like bad boys. A tigre, as they call it here. They can’t help but be attracted to an alpha male who may or may not be a criminal. So called “beta males” will not have as much dating success here and will probably be taken advantage of. If you are an alpha male with money then this could be the perfect country for you.</p>
<h3><strong>Finding The Right One</strong></h3>
<p>There are a lot of quality girls here, but it can be difficult to find one with the total package: looks, personality, brains, and loyalty. Perhaps the most difficult quality to get is loyalty. Attractive girls here have a lot of dating options and they have a lot of guys messaging them on Whatsapp. Cheating is common here, so you have to keep a close eye on your girl—especially at first when you are still getting to know each other.</p>
<p>One particular girl to avoid is the “chapiadora.” This is Dominican slang for a gold-digger, but it’s a little more than that. A chapiadora is a women who tries her hardest to extract money from guys and it doesn’t matter how old these guys are.</p>
<p>Chapiadoras are usually easy to spot—they can be seen wearing provocative clothing, heavy makeup, and hair extensions. And usually they are with an older guy. After living here for a while you can spot these women from a mile away. But when you first arrive you have to be careful. The music video below sums up the life of a “chapi.”</p>

<p>It’s also inconvenient that there are so many single moms here. Sometimes it seems like half the girls here are single moms- no exaggeration. However there are fewer single moms in the upper-class neighborhoods. It’s best to avoid dating these single moms because they will constantly ask you for money to give to their kids.</p>
<h3><strong>Where To Meet Dominican Girls</strong></h3>
<p>This is the question that guys always ask: what’s the best place to meet Dominican women? The short answer is that it’s best to meet them while living your day to day life. The nightlife scene here is not a great option for picking up women.</p>
<h3><strong>Daytime</strong></h3>
<p>I always think it’s best that you don’t go out of your way in order to meet girls. If you do, then it seems like you are trying too hard, and that can cause a girl to lose attraction for you. It’s best to just meet girls by going through your daily routine. Do you go to the gym? Well there are a lot of fit girls in the gym. Need to go to the mall and buy something? There are a lot of single girls shopping in the mall. Just go over and say hello.</p>
<p>It may seem difficult to go and talk to a complete stranger without the use of alcohol, but it can be fun and it gets easier with practice. You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take, and the girls here will be receptive to your approach. If they like you then you can get their number or go on an “instant date” with them. If they aren’t interested, they will politely excuse themselves.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that you have an advantage as a foreigner. Girls will be curious about you, and most of them won’t be shy in expressing interest. They will look at you and hold eye contact and some will even hiss at you. Make sure to take advantage of these opportunities by going over and making conversation. If you don’t act on it then you will spend the rest of the day thinking about what could have been.</p>
<h3><strong>Social Circle</strong></h3>
<p>After you’ve been living here a while then you’re going to meet people—both friends and acquaintances. This could be from playing basketball at the park or from going to the same restaurant and getting to know the staff. Regardless, the locals will try to set you up and it doesn’t matter with whom- it could be their sister, cousin, or even their mother. But most likely it will be their cousin because they all have a lot of cousins. So if you’re social, then you will get dates by not even trying.</p>
<h3><strong>Nightlife</strong></h3>
<p>Surprisingly, the nightlife is not very good here and it’s especially not very good for meeting girls. This is because single girls rarely go out by themselves. They usually go with guys so you will see a lot of mixed groups out at night. However there are a few good <a href="http://www.dominicanliving.net/santo-domingo-nightlife-guide/">nightlife venues in Santo Domingo</a> that are more western style.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dominican-girl-at-lounge.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-73035" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dominican-girl-at-lounge.jpg" alt="Dominican Girl at Lounge" width="433" height="578" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dominican-girl-at-lounge.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dominican-girl-at-lounge-300x400.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dominican-girl-at-lounge-262x349.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dominican-girl-at-lounge-574x765.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px"></a></p>
<h3><strong>Online Options</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re open to online dating then it can be very effective here. In Santo Domingo there are a lot of girls with online dating profiles so you would not run out of girls to message. The negative aspect of online dating is that it’s tedious and it can discourage you from talking to girls in real life. There are also a lot of poor girls who go on online dating sites in order to meet a foreigner to provide for them. The positive aspect of online dating is that it can lead to a lot of dates. The top online dating site here is <a href="http://www.dominicancupid.com/">Dominican Cupid</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Overall the girls here are nice, but they shouldn’t be the only reason you visit. You certainly have to be careful with some of these girls, especially when you first arrive and are unfamiliar with the culture. Before you arrive, you should study up on Spanish because it will certainly be helpful.</p>
