<p>In a joint report issued by the Black Dog Institute and Mission Australia, it has been found that young women are <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-21/young-women-twice-likely-than-young-men-to-have-mental-illness/6870968">twice as likely</a> to be mentally ill as young men. Conveniently, the adolescents and twenty-somethings of today comprise the first generation to have lived their entire lives within the shadow of third wave feminism, which is consistently thought of as starting in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Women gained the vote and joined the workforce en masse in the 20th century, yet the newest cohort of adult women or soon-to-be adult women appears to be the most miserable and emotionally ill-equipped female bunch of all time. Why? How?</p>
<p>Blaming the patriarchy for the mental woes of young womanhood would be an approach as moronic as it is predictable. By that standard, women should have been slitting their wrists in unison during the 1890s, before the suffragettes launched their biggest campaigns, or in the 1970s, when radical feminism told women about their so-called extra shackles and how every morning every man woke up for the express purpose of oppressing them forever.</p>
<p>With men being the gender actually targeted as a sport in modern Western society, it speaks volumes about the parlous state of feminism that women are the ones most in need of serious emotional intervention.</p>
<h3>The higher proportion of female mental illness reflects the warped theories of feminism</h3>
<div style="width: 509px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img src="../i.ytimg.com/vi/VqRoch-UZs4/hqdefault.jpg" alt="" width="499" height="374"><p class="wp-caption-text">Yes. Oui. Ja. Sí. Da.</p>
</div>
<p>For years and repeated ad nauseam, feminism has promulgated schizophrenic theories emphasizing cabalistic patriarchal “superstructures” designed to keep women down. Forgetting the massive diversity in human beings’ family backgrounds, educations, incomes and social standings, gender-obsessed SJWs continue to focus on male privilege, thereby assuming that a feminist’s garbage collector, paid $5-8 an hour, is part of the same secret conspiracy of prosperity as someone like Mitt Romney, whose net worth is $250 million. Instead of pointing out the basic flaws of this paradigm, feminists have raised it to an inexorable physical law.</p>
<p>In the meantime, feminist ringleaders have taught women two highly contradictory precepts: 1) you’re capable, much more so than the boys and 2) you need gender quotas, female-only STEM scholarships, female-only mentoring programs and the elimination of corporate salary negotiations. However many women may agree with the self-promoting privileges of being female in the workplace, a great deal of them sense that the system is unfairly geared in their favor. Feelings of unworthiness, pressure and uncertainty are bound to emanate from society-wide circumstances such as these.</p>
<p>What’s more is the paranoia that feminism requires to sustain itself. Feminists take the make-up of Fortune 500 companies, which still elevate a number of women, and assume that these are the command centers of some monolithic patriarchal conspiracy more all-encompassing than the energy-producing lies created by the machines in <em>The Matrix</em> films.</p>
<p>Can you imagine having to live like this? As claimed even by mangina male feminists and white knights, <strong><em>all</em></strong> men <strong><em>must</em></strong> have rampant unconscious biases against women and switches of oppressive behavior that simply cannot be turned off. Many women who do not describe themselves as feminists are already impacted by this supernatural climate of apparently always being undermined and victimized. It’s a wonder many of them even leave the house every day with so much for them to rage spiral about.</p>

<h3>Women are having their femininity pressed out from them, starting in childhood and leading to mental illness</h3>

</div>
<p>We live in a world where Caitlyn Jenner can supposedly transition from man to woman because it’s “natural,” but young girls are taught that the way women usually behave is actually a gendered construct. Despite the presence of two X chromosomes compared to a male’s XY combination, somehow women have to behave like men. Constant SlutWalks, exhortations by phenomenally privileged pop stars like Beyoncé and Lady Gaga, and all manner of other feminist devices are used to command women to rise up from their “oppressed” state.</p>
<p>And guess what? Womankind is more depressed than ever before. Beneath the facade of liberation and self-love advertised by media outlets and mainstream commentators lies an unrecognized truth: women are acting in ways they do not like. They are told to worship their bodies but almost all of them want the body of another girl.</p>
<p>The chasm between their furious affirmations of happiness and their subconscious impulses to be something else is only widening. Combined with the serious factor paranoia, this is bound to lead to hatred of oneself, masked by an over-assertive and bitchy personality.</p>
<h3>Rehabilitate the girls with moderate symptoms but forget the truly toxic fatties and SJWs</h3>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img src="../i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/07/01/article-0-058CAEB9000005DC-251_634x912.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="431"><p class="wp-caption-text">Never do this to save a woman from either her own feminist conditioning or conditioning she has regularly accepted.</p>
</div>
<p>You might be surprised about how many girls have only a moderate exposure to feminist ideas. Well, exposure is a bad word because all people are now constantly accosted by feminist mantras. But many girls have not <em><strong>absorbed</strong></em> this poison or may even have rejected it. A great proportion of these women do not require any form of rehabilitation, whereas some others do. And rehabilitation, at least in the way I am using it, is not the big, bad, white knight concept you may know it as.</p>
<p>Do not go out of your way, pretty much <strong><em>ever</em></strong>, to save a girl from herself. Good luck with that one because it’s a waste of your energy, time and resources, no matter how much you “succeed” at it. What I mean by rehabilitation is implicitly reminding a woman why, beyond the SJW cultural conditioning she has had peppered past her, she wants a man in the first place. And that reminding takes the form of being the man <em>ROK</em> is teaching you to be.</p>
<p>In between the menagerie of women emotionally and cognitively enfeebled by feminism, you can find enough other girls of sound or close to sound mental constitution. In a nutshell, this means girls who actually want to be girls.</p>
