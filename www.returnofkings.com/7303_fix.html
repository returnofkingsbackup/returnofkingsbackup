<p>The Western world is a smartphone-riddled wasteland—D.C. is a domineering career chick hell-hole, Toronto is a feminist hotbed, the UK is full of nasty slags, and the Pacific Northwest is overrun with hipster-feminism.</p>

<p>What’s a red blooded male with a thirst for making love to feminine women in the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">alley behind a club</span> comfort of his own home, on sheets of Egyptian cotton, to do?</p>
<p>For one, our hero could move to poosy paradises such as Eastern Europe or Southeast Asia, but that is not in the cards for our typical reader. They may want to stay close to family, friends, or other commitments. Our hero could find a new job and relocate to somewhere more promising, but what if this too is not an option?</p>
<p>I’m willing to bet the average reader is not as free as he wants to be and is tied down with a job, friends, debt etc. So what is a man like this to do when faced with such formidable cockblocking circumstances?</p>
<p><b>Realize These Are Limiting Beliefs</b></p>
<p>I’ve heard guys complain that girls are always locked down with guys in their city. They have this self-defeating mindset that they’re either all taken or have hundreds of nice-guys beating down their doors. First of all there is a 69% chance she is actually lying about having a boyfriend to avoid ‘awkward feelings.’ Second, more often than not a girl will cheat on her boyfriend, and with the increase in polyamory girls will have no qualms with you raw-dogging her in the bathroom of a dark nightclub. Third, it’s nothing more than a limiting belief, since dudes out there are getting laid. Many of the top game writers honed their skills in the harsh environments described above.</p>
<p>Over at the forum user <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-21379.html">makaveli </a>wrote a post about these limiting beliefs. He listed things he believed had a negative effect on pussy-pounding efficiency. They included: smartphones, social media, bad logistics, large groups, boyfriends and an unfeminine social climate. Think about it for a minute, what was the last complaint you had about your town, what was the last reason you gave yourself for not getting the bang? Make a list of all of these and realize they are limiting beliefs, you are hurting your success by just thinking “all the girls are in big social circles at night, I can’t isolate them easily so I’m not getting laid.”</p>

<p><b>Find The Silver Lining</b></p>
<p>Once you’ve got your list of limiting beliefs, take a long, hard look at them. Is there anything that stands out as impossible to overcome? Probably not, unless one of them is “I don’t have a dick so I can’t have sex with girls.”</p>
<p>The next step is to find the silver lining in these limiting beliefs. Think about each one and how you could possibly work it to your advantage. User <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-21379.html">makaveli </a>said he employed the bathroom bang to overcome logistics, used social media to create local celebrity, acknowledged the ‘danger’ in flirting with a taken women, texted girls pictures of him and her to prevent flakes and so on.</p>
<p>In my case my city is full of hipsters and unfeminine women with an emphasis on tight knit social circles and poor logistics. I can complain about this or I can relocate and use social media to my advantage creating an online persona. I can also attend as many events as I can, getting to meet more and more people where my preferred women are. Many of the hipster chicks claim they are polyamorous to rationalize away any feelings of ‘being a slut’ they may have. To me this just means easy sex with skinny hipster chicks.</p>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sl.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7309" alt="sl" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/03/sl.jpg" width="484" height="322"></a></p>
<p>If you don’t have the means or the will to drastically change your environment, you can always adapt to it. Most reasons for not getting laid, or finding quality women are just limiting beliefs. I don’t believe anyone who says “all women in this city are ___, there are no sweet, feminine, thin women.” There always will be girls who are exactly your type. You just have to find the silver lining in your situations and look for them. Brainstorm, look up ways to demolish limiting beliefs, and find a way to get the girl you desire.</p>
