<p><em>The following article was sponsored by <a href="http://johndoebodybuilding.com?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">John Doe Bodybuilding</a></em></p>
<p>After months of effort, Straight from the Underground – The Underground Steroid Guidebook, is finally complete and available.</p>
<p><a href="http://johndoebodybuilding.com/straight-from-the-underground/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow"><img class=" wp-image-2598 alignnone" title="" src="../johndoebodybuilding.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/sftu-book2sm.png" alt="Straight from the Underground book cover" width="406" height="395"></a></p>
<p><strong>I’m really excited to be releasing this ebook on performance enhancement because it’s knowledge to you from personal experience!!!</strong></p>
<p>You see, unlike the rest of the internet community who are basically a bunch of talking parrots, I talk about things I’ve actually done!!</p>
<p><strong>I dispel the myths and the lies and steer you through the smoke. There is a lot of wrong information floating around now, and this information is hurting people more and more by the day.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the internet is a valuable tool for research and learning, but the issue with performance enhancers is that you pick up little pieces of info here and there and then try to put it together like a puzzle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://johndoebodybuilding.com/straight-from-the-underground/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">&gt;&gt; Straight From the Undergound available here &lt;&lt;</a></span></p>
<p><strong>What if you had a comprehensive guide that would drive you straight to the answers you were looking for? </strong></p>
<p>Well now you do, Straight from the Underground takes you deep into the dark side of anabolic steroids, peptides, HGH, insulin, post cycle therapy, and troubleshooting issues such as injection infections and measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Straight from the Underground covers unit conversions in an easy to understand manner that is like 1,2,3!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“This is how much water you draw out to fill this vial of peptide, and this is what you draw your insulin syringe back to when using this peptide every day.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Straight from the Underground is so easy to read and effective that it took my book editor from knowing NOTHING ABOUT PERFORMANCE ENHANCERS to knowing MORE THAN MOST SEASONED GYM VETS after just a couple reads.</strong></p>
<p>When he told me how much he had learned about anabolics, I knew right then and there that this was going to be a great book on performance enhancement!!!</p>
<p>Numerous cycle layouts are explained right down to the T; everything from how many weeks to what doses to when you switch compounds, to when you add in compounds.</p>
<h3>For every steroid, peptide, or HGH, there are cycle layouts that directly follow.</h3>
<p><strong>Everything from beginner cycles to intermediate, to cycles a top bodybuilder would run are covered in this read!! </strong></p>
<p>Yes, I am biased towards old school cycles and moderate dosages, so you’ll see a lot of that in this guide, but you’ll also see some examples of peptide runs combined with steroid cycles that even I wouldn’t run, but someone else may, and I wanted to include everyone in Straight from the Underground.</p>

<p><strong>There are many guys out there with nobody to talk to on this topic, so think of Straight from the Underground as your steroid reference bible.</strong></p>
