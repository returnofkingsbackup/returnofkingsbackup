<p>Get ready for more rape mania, because comedian Margaret Cho is sponsoring a Twitter campaign entitled #12DaysofRage. The stated purpose of the campaign is to “end the silence surrounding sexual abuse.” While it sounds like a noble purpose, it is likely to degenerate into just another vehicle for generating more rape hysteria.</p>
<h3>Margaret Cho: Poster Child For Progressivism’s Effect On Women</h3>
<div id="attachment_73164" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-73164 size-medium" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clipofday3008037-300x300.jpg" alt="clipofday3008037" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clipofday3008037.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clipofday3008037-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/clipofday3008037-262x262.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Margaret Cho from her recent appearance on the Wendy Williams Show</p>
</div>
<p>Margaret Cho is a Korean-American comedian who experienced quite a bit of mainstream success in the early 2000s with her stand up comedy tours. Later, she took up progressive causes with a vengeance and it seemed to have hurt her career a bit.</p>
<p>Cho is the poster child for what happens to women if they follow progressive philosophy to its logical end. First, she is massively tatted. While searching for a pic of her tattoos I saw—to my eternal regret—that even her butt cheeks are covered in tattoos. As ROK readers know, excessive <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/45334/5-reasons-why-girls-with-tattoos-andor-piercings-are-broken">tattoos are an indicator of emotional instability</a>.</p>

<p>She thinks white people are horribly racist, but when it comes to reverse discrimination, they are “fragile.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

Cho is strongly pro abortion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I do not believe in a God who would consider abortion a sin. God created abortion. As he did all of us. God created choice for all to DECIDE — Margaret Cho (@margaretcho) <a href="https://twitter.com/margaretcho/status/648739936875601920">September 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>She was a sex worker.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Sex work is simply work. For me it was honest work. I was a sex worker when I was young. It was hard but well paid. There’s no shame in it. — Margaret Cho (@margaretcho) <a href="https://twitter.com/margaretcho/status/659855348489154560">October 29, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Cho has been involved in polyamorous relationships. Of course, she also claims to be bisexual.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>I am more than bisexual. I am everything. I am all love. — Margaret Cho (@margaretcho) <a href="https://twitter.com/margaretcho/status/466292026032410624">May 13, 2014</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Cho is a big advocate of the LGBTQ community. She claims to be Christian but she also thinks that Jesus was a “<a href="http://www.pqmonthly.com/jesus-power-bottom-margaret-cho-politics-polyamory-parenting-ourselves/17037">power bottom</a>.”</p>
<blockquote><p> I think Jesus is a very good teacher. Really, he’s such a power bottom! Jesus was all about taking other people’s pain and absorbing it, and making himself stronger because of it — absorbing all the negativity from your persecutors and taking it on for someone else. He is not at all about guilt. A lot of Christianity has been distorted by anti-gay stuff that doesn’t even exist in the Bible at all. I think of Christ, at face value, is very much a power bottom. That’s a really good thing to be!</p></blockquote>
<p>Margaret is uniquely qualified to kick off the #12DaysofRage because she too claims to have been a victim of rape.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Send me your videos – tell me your story. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/12daysofrage?src=hash">#12daysofrage</a> I was a victim of rape for far too long. Now I’m a SURVIVOR! Tell me how you lived. — Margaret Cho (@margaretcho) <a href="https://twitter.com/margaretcho/status/660912302833668096">November 1, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The premise for the campaign, which started on November 1st, is that for twelve days people will tweet out about their rapes so that Cho and other Twitter people can say things like, “I support you.” At the end of the twelve days, Cho will release a video entitled “I Wanna Kill My Rapist.” As you can imagine with a name like #12DaysofRage and someone as flakey as Cho spearheading it, the campaign is probably not going to be a healthy exercise. Rather, it is going to be another status signaling drill in our perpetually injured therapy culture.</p>
<h3>The Crime Of Rape</h3>
<div id="attachment_73179" style="width: 413px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-73179" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BxkEWpeCQAAIczx-300x225.jpg" alt="BxkEWpeCQAAIczx" width="403" height="302" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BxkEWpeCQAAIczx-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BxkEWpeCQAAIczx-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BxkEWpeCQAAIczx-574x431.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BxkEWpeCQAAIczx.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Mattress Girl and a friend</p>
</div>
<p>Let me just say at the outset that rape is a serious crime—it is a felony in every state. Rape occurs when a person engages in sex with another person by “forcible compulsion” or “incapable of consent by reason of being physically helpless.” Rape can also occur if the victim is underage, regardless of whether he or she consents or not. All decent men hate rapists. The man who uses his superior strength to force himself upon a weaker person simply to relieve his base passion is beyond despicable.</p>
<p>The harsh sentences for rape reflect society’s universal contempt for this crime. Because rape is such a serious crime, the criminal justice system also contains protections for individuals who are accused of rape. As in every other crime, the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty. To do this, there needs to be evidence to convict the accused. It is not a perfect system. Sometimes guilty men go free and innocent men are sent to prison.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, though, we’ve seen a shift in society. Years of feminist indoctrination have taught us that rape can be virtually anything. The best example of this is the Rolling Stone Duke rape hoax where innocent men were punished for what turned out to be a complete fabrication.</p>
<h3>#12DaysofRage</h3>
<p>The most interesting thing about this campaign is that I don’t think it would be at all helpful to a real rape survivor. How are encouraging words from a Twitter “friend” going help anyone heal from a violent sexual assault? This is obvious from conversations like this which are more about status signaling and affirming the new fake genders that Facebook popularized than they are about recovering from rape.</p>

<p>There are a lot of tweets expressing the absolute necessity of believing the rape claim, even if there is no evidence to back it up. To do anything less is hurtful.</p>

<p>The good news is that while these people may be suffering from their rape, recovery is on its way with these soothing words from Margaret Cho herself.

</div>
<p>While #12DaysofRage purports to be against rape, it is silent on some of the most heinous sexual assaults that are being committed today. The tweeters are silent on the 80% of women and girls who are raped while they are trying to cross into the US illegally. They are silent on ISIS rape camps, and they are silent on the rapes that the Islamic “refugees” are committing as they invade Europe. The reason that Margaret Cho and the other tweeters conveniently ignore these atrocities because they don’t fit into the narrative that most sexual assaults are being committed by straight white men in the US.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>#12DaysofRage sounds like it has a very lofty goal, but I believe its main purpose is to give publicity to boost Margaret Cho’s flagging career. Even if we assume that it has pure motives, receiving an affirmation on Twitter is not likely to do much to heal memories of an actual rape. Instead, it is just another stunt that feeds rape hysteria and the culture of perpetual emotional butthurt. It also shows that while there are some good things happening in our culture, the majority of society is still mired in feminist indoctrination.</p>
