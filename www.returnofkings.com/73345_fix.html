<p>With the rapidly decaying state of Western civilization, satire is almost redundant. Exhibit A: the collective meltdown unfolding at Yale University over an “offensive” email.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, October 28, Dean Burgwell Howard sent an email to Yale undergraduates via the college’s Intercultural Affairs Committee imploring students not to wear “offensive” or “unacceptable” costumes on Halloween. One of the faculty, Associate Professor of Silliman College Erika Christakis, <a href="https://www.thefire.org/yale-students-demand-resignations-from-faculty-members-over-halloween-email/">sent an email to Silliman’s community in which she criticized Howard for being overly PC and coddling students’ sensibilities</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious… a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive? American universities were once a safe space not only for maturation but also for a certain regressive, or even transgressive, experience; increasingly, it seems, they have become places of censure and prohibition.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response, Yale students have gone completely insane, with over 700 people signing an open letter accusing Christakis of “invalidating” the voices of minority students. Last Wednesday, several hundred students gathered for an open forum on institutional racism at Yale in which Christakis’ email was a major topic of discussion. Finally, the day after, students staged a protest at Silliman College itself, demanding an apology from Christakis.</p>
<p>Christakis’ husband Nicholas, himself the master of Silliman, was beset upon by angry students trying to browbeat him into an apology:</p>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="900" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/9IEFD_JVYd0%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>To his credit, Christakis refused to apologize for either his or his wife’s comments, which has further inflamed the protesters’ temper tantrums. Students are now outright demanding that the two of them resign from their positions at Silliman, and a few have even claimed that they will refuse to accept their diplomas from Christakis at graduation.</p>
<p>The hysterical response to Erika Christakis’ email is disturbing evidence of how cultural Marxism has intellectually crippled an entire generation of students. Colleges and universities are supposed to be places of learning, where students are taught how to think, have their worldviews challenged and become fully mature adults. But as the above video shows, Yale students are explicitly demanding that the university cater to their easily bruised <em>feeeeeelings.</em></p>
<h3>The Myth Of The “White Girls Only” Party</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-73357" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/erika-christakis.jpg" alt="erika-christakis" width="358" height="438" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/erika-christakis.jpg 409w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/erika-christakis-300x367.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/erika-christakis-262x320.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px"></p>
<p>The <em>S</em><span class="_Tgc"><em>turm und Drang</em> about “racism” at Yale </span>doesn’t end with Christakis’ email. Recently, the university made national news <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/05/did-yale-s-whites-only-party-really-happen.html">after allegations that Yale’s chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity held a “White Girls Only” party on Halloween</a>. After leftists finished gnashing their teeth in disgust at SAE’s “bigotry,” journalists could not find any evidence that the frat’s party excluded non-whites, aside from one black student’s post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In contrast to this account, an off-the-record undergraduate at Yale also told The Daily Beast that he was at the SAE Halloween party and doubts the story of black students being singled out and denied entrance. “I seriously doubt that happened. There were plenty of black people there,” he said.</p>

<p>The dubiousness of the story’s veracity didn’t stop the <em>New York Post</em> and other media outlets from reporting it as fact, nor did it stop last Wednesday’s open forum on institutional racism at Yale from making the supposed “White Girls Only” a major topic of discussion.</p>
<h3>Coddled Students Make For Whiny Stormtroopers</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-73358" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-christakis.jpg" alt="nicholas-christakis" width="415" height="282" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-christakis.jpg 660w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-christakis-300x204.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-christakis-262x178.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/nicholas-christakis-574x390.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px"></p>
<p>As <em>FIRE</em> (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) puts it in their report on this incident, this is yet more evidence for what FIRE President Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt have termed the “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/09/the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/399356/">coddling of the American mind</a>.” Universities, once focused on challenging students’ perceptions of the world, now seek to reinforce them and cater to increasingly whiny demands. Lukianoff and Haidt name some particularly shocking examples of how colleges are bending over backwards for their whiniest students:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some recent campus actions border on the surreal. In April, at Brandeis University, the Asian American student association sought to raise awareness of microaggressions against Asians through an installation on the steps of an academic hall. The installation gave examples of microaggressions such as “Aren’t you supposed to be good at math?” and “I’m colorblind! I don’t see race.” But a backlash arose among other Asian American students, who felt that the display itself was a microaggression. The association removed the installation, and its president wrote an e-mail to the entire student body apologizing to anyone who was “triggered or hurt by the content of the microaggressions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As Lukianoff and Haidt point out in the article, not only is this obsession with “trigger warnings” and “microaggressions” hurting students’ mental health, it’s inculcating an authoritarian, anti-free speech attitude in their behavior. Watch the video above of Nicholas Christakis being confronted by an angry student. She’s so consumed with emotion that she can’t control herself and actually insults Christakis—the head of her college—to his face, telling him to “be quiet” and asking “who the fuck hired you?”</p>
<p>Coddling American students leaves them in a state of perpetual childishness, leading them to violently lash out at anyone who hurts their feelings, threatening free speech in the process. As we’ve seen with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/68757/why-are-canadian-feminists-so-desperately-trying-to-shut-down-rooshs-speeches">the violent response to Roosh’s “State of Man” speeches in Canada</a> or <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/73185/how-left-wing-activists-tried-to-shut-down-this-years-npi-conference">antifas openly attacking attendees of the National Policy Institute’s annual conference</a>, it doesn’t take much to inspire leftists to commit violent acts against their ideological foes.</p>
<p>Fortunately for us, Christakis and her husband have yet to apologize or concede anything to the mob that’s screaming for their heads. However, the struggle to defend freedom of speech against the perpetually offended continues. Unless we stand firm against these mewling babies, they will slowly strip us of the freedoms that our forefathers fought to obtain, all in the name of preserving their <em>feeeeeelings.</em></p>
