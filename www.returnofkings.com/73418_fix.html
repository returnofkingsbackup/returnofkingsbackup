<p>The Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) have claimed another scalp. Tim Wolfe, the president of the University of Missouri System, was forced to resign in response to students who were protesting the mythological bogeyman known as “white privilege.”</p>
<p>The episode not only demonstrates capitulation in the face of criticism, but it also shows our universities are educating young men and women to be entitled whiners instead of productive citizens.</p>
<h3>The Facebook Post That Started It All</h3>
<div id="attachment_73429" style="width: 250px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-73429 size-medium" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/55f7508e5b43f.image_-300x375.jpg" alt="55f7508e5b43f.image" width="240" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/55f7508e5b43f.image_-300x375.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/55f7508e5b43f.image_-667x834.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/55f7508e5b43f.image_-262x328.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/55f7508e5b43f.image_-574x718.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/55f7508e5b43f.image_.jpg 819w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Payton Head</p>
</div>
<p>The controversy got its start on September 12th when Payton Head, the President of the Missouri Students Association, wrote the following on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/payton.head/posts/10205183585252620">Facebook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just want to say how extremely hurt and disappointed I am. Last night as I walking through campus, some guys riding on the back of a pickup truck decided that it would be okay to continuously scream NIGGER at me. I really just want to know why my simple existence is such a threat to society. For those of you who wonder why I’m always talking about the importance of inclusion and respect, it’s because I’ve experienced moments like this multiple times at THIS university, making me not feel included here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Head doesn’t indicate whether or not these were fellow college students. However, he does immediately link this to the wider list of SJW hot buttons including Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, and their all-time favorite, rape. If you read this description it is pretty clear who Head thinks the demon is—it is straight, cis-gendered, white, Christian males:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of you are so privileged that you’ll never know what it feels like to be a hijab-wearing Muslim woman and be called a terrorist or a towel head. You don’t have to think about being transgender and worrying about finding a restroom where you can go and not be targeted for violence because you don’t fit into the gender binary.</p>
<p>You’ll never know what it feels like to see Memorial Union every day and enter the side like a second class citizen because after 90 years, there’s still no accessible way to enter the tower. You’ve never been spit on walking down 9th street or mis-gendered at Pizza Tree because they called out your birth name. You’ve never had to experience people throwing drinks on you and yelling FAGGOT at you from the patio at Big 12 as you walk past on the street holding hands with your partner.</p>
<p>You might never had to think twice about what you’re wearing walking around campus at night so that someone won’t think it’s okay to take ownership of your body because your outfit was “asking for it.” If your simple existence is not a political statement <strong>I’m really going to need for you to check your privilege</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>President Refuses To Address Protestors</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/u6zwnmlzZSQ.html" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br>
Head’s Facebook post went viral and it motivated a small group of students to block the university president’s car during the homecoming parade on October 13th. The president did not respond to the protesters. To make the optics worse, a group of white people formed a line in between the car and the protesters to protect the president and his car. Finally, police were called into to break up the protest.</p>
<p>To be fair to the students, it sounds like this protest did not come out of the blue, and the president may have been tone deaf in addressing concerns. The students claim that they only blocked the president’s car because “after years of constant emailing, letter writing, and social media outreach,” the president still had not responded “to the issues of racial injustice” at the university. The students went on to say that the demonstration was not an indictment on white people but on “the structures in place that uphold white supremacy.”</p>
<p>While the president may have been derelict in his leadership duties at other times, his refusal to address the protesters during the homecoming parade was correct. The president had no way of knowing whether the protesters were even university students. It was a very aggressive gesture, and the people in the car likely feared for their safety.</p>
<h3>Concerned Student 1950</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-73470" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CTZMZyxW4AAKEzb-300x169.jpg" alt="CTZMZyxW4AAKEzb" width="418" height="236" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CTZMZyxW4AAKEzb-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CTZMZyxW4AAKEzb-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CTZMZyxW4AAKEzb.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px"></p>
<p>After the protest, the students issued a “List of Demands” that they wanted president Wolfe to comply with. The first demand was that Wolfe must hold a press conference where he would apologize to the homecoming parade protesters. During press conference, he would also be required to “acknowledge his white male privilege, recognize that systems of oppression exist, and provide a verbal commitment” to fulfilling the rest of the students’ demands.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>The second demand was that Wolfe resign or be fired from his job as president of the university system, and that the next president be selected by a “collective of students, staff, and faculty of diverse backgrounds.” The protesters <strong>do not provide any justification for why the president should lose his job.</strong></p>
<p>The fourth demand was that the university must create and enforce “racial awareness and inclusion curriculum throughout all campus departments.” Attendance at these “racial awareness” courses would be mandatory “for all students, faculty, staff, and administration.” This curriculum “must be vetted, maintained, and overseen by a board comprised of students, staff, and faculty of color.”</p>
<p>The fifth demand was that the university increase its percentage of black faculty and campus staff by 10%. Note that when it comes to jobs, the students drop the pretense that this is about people “of color.” This is all about getting more<em> black</em> jobs doing make-work diversity nonsense. Sorry Asians and “hijab-wearing Muslim women.” When it comes to jobs, the protesters think you are not colorful enough.</p>
<p>The rest of the demands are along the same line. The manifesto was signed “Concerned Student 1950.” President Wolfe was given eight days to comply with the demands or face the “appropriate nonviolent actions” of the protesters.</p>
<h3>Poop Swastika, Hunger Strike, And Football Player Strike</h3>
<div id="attachment_73465" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-73465 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/HFMvLi8N_400x400-300x300.jpg" alt="HFMvLi8N_400x400" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/HFMvLi8N_400x400-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/HFMvLi8N_400x400-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/HFMvLi8N_400x400-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/HFMvLi8N_400x400.jpg 380w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Jonathan Butler channeling the civil rights activists of the 1960s</p>
</div>
<p>On October 26 tensions were further heightened when the racists struck again. This time, the offense came in the form of a swastika drawn in feces on a bathroom wall in a dormitory. No culprit was identified. Although it is possible that this was just a hoax, it didn’t stop the news media from using the incident to fan the flames.</p>
<p>After president Wolfe failed to comply with the demands of the manifesto, student Jonathan Butler, who calls himself a “Liberation Activist. Human Rights Advocate,” went on a hunger strike on November 2nd.</p>
<p>While the hunger strike might have been somewhat compelling, what really got Wolfe to capitulate was threatening the university’s coffers. Over the weekend of November 7th, the protesters were able to enlist the help of 30 members of the University of Missouri football team. The players stated that they would refuse to play as long as Wolfe remained as president.</p>
<h3>Victory</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-73464 " title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-6.39.03-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-11-09 at 6.39.03 PM" width="430" height="247" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-6.39.03-PM.png 1194w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-6.39.03-PM-300x172.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-6.39.03-PM-837x481.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-6.39.03-PM-667x383.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-6.39.03-PM-262x151.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-09-at-6.39.03-PM-574x330.png 574w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px"></p>
<p>Wolfe did nothing to defend himself. He did nothing to try to change the narrative or defend his record. He did nothing to appeal to wider body of students. He appeared completely passive. With the threat of lost revenue hanging over his head, Wolfe resigned on November 9th.</p>
<p>As is typical when people capitulate to SJWs, Wolfe went down sounding weak.  He said he resigned “out of love, not hate” and that he hopes the university can “move forward together.”</p>
<p>The protesters of Concerned Student 1950 are obviously jubilant over their victory, but one has to ask whether American universities really need is more diversity training and more diversity officers. What about curricula that ensure that graduates are better equipped to get jobs in a difficult market? Or more rigorous standards so that getting a degree amounts to more than just paying tuition? The protesters do not seem to be concerned with academic excellence—only entitlement.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The success of the Concerned Student 1950 protest guarantees that we are going to see more of these types of protests at other schools. University presidents who want to keep their jobs will unilaterally cave to protester demands.</p>
<p>We can also expect universities to preemptively add more SJW overhead to their already bloated administrations. A university education, which is already overpriced, will become even more costly and even more irrelevant. The triumphant march of the social justice warriors will only be stopped when someone has the courage to stand up and say, “No, I will not yield to your demands.”</p>
