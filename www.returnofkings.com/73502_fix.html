<p>I have lived in Tucson, Arizona for a few years, and I have become very acquainted with the city. It has a population of over 500,000 and is situated a little over 100 miles from Phoenix (which is the 6<sup>th</sup> most populated city in America) and around 60 miles away from the U.S-Mexico border. As with any other city, Tucson has its ups and downs. I want to share with you my objective (and subjective) view of the city..</p>
<h3>Living</h3>
<p>One of Tucson’s main employers is the University of Arizona. Without the university, I don’t think there would be anything going for Tucson. Since the city has no major league sports teams, Tucsonans are attracted to the university’s sports teams, regardless of age. This makes for good social interactions when a game is on, since it is a good reason for the average Tucsonan to leave the house. Social networking is easy regardless of if there is a game on, but this makes it easier. The people are very open to outsiders.</p>
<p>If you are a younger reader and plan on attending the University of Arizona, you will be able to establish a good social network that meets your needs, as long as you are outgoing and not socially awkward. If that is not a good description of you, make it a good description. I’m sure that some of you who would like to go to this university have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsX-01gPtf4">the pool parties posted on YouTube</a>, but keep in mind you still need to be outgoing (and willing to participate in white trash debauchery) to have any sort of enjoyment out of such functions.</p>

<p>The TUC is a pretty inexpensive place to live, compared to other larger cities in the US. Rent is almost never above $1,000 regardless of what part of town you live, and you can easily find a good place for under $500. Drinks are also quite inexpensive. You can have a pretty fun night out for less than $30, and dates almost never cost more than $50. If you are spending more than $50 on a date, you are either on a very fancy date or need to cut back on the appetizers (or date skinnier women).</p>
<p>Tucson is a very seasonal city. I don’t mean that it has four seasons; I mean that folks tend to leave town during the holidays and summer months, so expect a deserted city during those times.</p>
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>The dirty T is mainly a liberal city; however, I have had chats with plenty of men and women who share traditional conservative viewpoints. The good news is that if you are not open about your views in public, you won’t really hear anyone discuss theirs. People here are very laid back, and even the most radical feminists don’t feel the need to tell everyone their opinions. Most people here just put their opinions on their car via stickers or on their Facebook. Expect rednecks, hippies, and “intellectuals,” since Tucson is full of all of them.</p>
<h3>But…</h3>
<p>Arizona, specifically Tucson, has some of the highest rates of domestic violence in the country. This leads to a surge of feminists with an agenda to capitalize off of the victims of such abuse. Feminism is on the rise in this city, so understand the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/26763/girls-with-short-hair-are-damaged">signs</a> so you know <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/45334/5-reasons-why-girls-with-tattoos-andor-piercings-are-broken">who</a> and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/64661/5-reasons-why-you-should-never-date-a-girl-with-dyed-hair">what</a> to avoid, as you can spot such garbage from a mile away in Tucson. If they have any politically-charged sticker on their car, avoid them.</p>
<h3>Nightlife</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-73512 " title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/club-congress-e1447131711281.jpg" alt="" width="522" height="348"></p>
<p>Tucson nightlife is centered around either the university or downtown area, which are about a mile apart. Outside of this area are the dead suburbs or barrios. Expect to see plenty of college students. Again, you won’t spend too much on a regular night out. If you live pretty far from each of these locations, it shouldn’t cost more than a $20 Uber ride, since it’s located in the middle of the city.</p>

</div>
<p>The nightlife scene has a little bit of everything; dive bars, microbreweries, billiards, regular bars, and even a few nightclubs to spit that game and get your dance on. Occasionally you may have an entrance line that could take a little more than five minutes to overcome, and sometimes you get a cover fee of $5-10. If you are really good at social networking, however, cutting lines is a very feasible possibility here. For me it probably only took a few months to get to know the managers and bouncers at all of my favorite spots, and I’ll be damned if I have to wait in line again. Social networking is key in this city.</p>
<h3>Women</h3>
<p>If your thing is black or Asian women, I can’t say much since there is an insufficient amount of them to make a judgment. The majority of women are either white or Latina, so learning Spanish can go a long ways in Tucson. My standards would say that the average (mean) woman in Tucson is a 5.5 with one of the highest standard deviations I have ever seen in a city.</p>
<p>For example, for every 8 and 9 (which there are plenty of), there is a 1 or 2 morbidly obese welfare recipients strolling around in an electric wheelchair at your local supermarket to buy her two-liter soda, or some crusty hippie picking off her scabs outside your favorite dive bar. Luckily you won’t see these she-beasts in a nightclub.</p>
<p>For every 6 and 7, there is a 3 or 4 fatty barely fitting into a skin-tight dress, drunkenly hitting on men way out of their league (expect to see a fair amount of these at nightclubs). For every long haired, high-heeled-wearing feminine woman, there is a bald, tatted up woman resembling the character Edward Furlong played in American History X. Speaking of tattoos, I’d say that 60% of the women in Tucson have at least one on their body, and about 30% have many visible tattoos. If you view tattoos as trashy and unattractive, consider another city.</p>

</div>
<p>One thing I’ve noticed about the 7.5s and up is that they are much harder to crack than they are in other cities, they usually have boyfriends, and they usually don’t have sex with someone that they just met (not saying it doesn’t happen). If you are decent looking, well dressed, well accomplished, and have adequate game, however, you will have your choice of most girls in the 7.5-9 ballpark.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an same night lay it won’t be hard to find, but it will probably be with a girl who is below a 7.5. In other words, there are plenty of good looking women here, but like every city, they don’t come easy, and they are a minority. This rule applies as well for the university students, except the fact that most of the women in the university don’t expect you to have a solid career or wear $400+ worth of clothing just yet.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I understand this city is not for everyone. It has a much slower pace compared to bigger cities, it is centered around college frat-tards, it has an increasing feminist presence, and is a hit-or-miss with the ladies. However, if you are looking to escape the big city for a more laid back environment with most of the same amenities, Tucson may be worth considering.</p>
