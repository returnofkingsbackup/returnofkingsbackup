<p>Two teenage girls were raped this week in Finland. The alleged perpetrators are both reported to be asylum seekers, and the tension is rising between the Finns and their new neighbors.</p>
<p>Is it racist to be concerned that more rapes will be the outcome when immigrants pour into Western countries? Well, if you look at the statistics, it doesn’t seem to be a very far-fetched idea.</p>
<h3>Immigrant rapes cause outrage</h3>
<p>A Finnish 14-year-old girl has allegedly been <a href="http://www.friatider.se/invandrarv-ldt-kt-v-cker-vrede-i-finland" target="_blank">raped by an immigrant</a> man. The crime took place in Kempele in Finland, at 10:30 pm this past Monday. The police arrested two suspected teenage men. One of them has been <a href="http://hbl.fi/nyheter/2015-11-25/779894/ena-misstankta-valdtakten-i-kempele-slapptes" target="_blank">released</a> while the other, a 17-year-old, is still in custody. The interrogations have so far shown that the suspect and the victim knew each other in some way.</p>
<p>News sources claim the alleged perpetrator was an asylum seeker and that he was arrested at a refugee camp in Kempele. The police has been reluctant to reveal which country he comes from. Cases that involve foreigners, and particularly asylum seekers, are kept secret, says one police commissioner.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Juha Sipilä gave a <a href="http://hbl.fi/nyheter/2015-11-24/779654/polisen-14-arig-flicka-valdtogs-i-kempele" target="_blank">comment</a> about the incident on Tuesday. Connecting the crime to immigration policy, he said that it should be discussed “if the convicted in these kinds of cases should automatically be deported.” According to Sipilä, the staff at the refugee camps have tried to inform the asylum seekers about how to behave around women in Finland.</p>
<p>The rape has caused an outrage in social media, and the police have called on people to calm themselves. On Friday, the police <a href="http://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/11/27/justitieministern-asylsokande-ar-en-sakerhetsrisk" target="_blank">revealed</a> that another 14-year-old girl was raped on Tuesday. This time they didn’t shy away from saying that the suspect is an asylum seeker, who arrived in Finland a year ago.</p>

<h4>Sweden is no exception</h4>
<p>Although mainstream media won’t mention it, immigrants in Sweden are engaging in these sexual crimes as well. In March, a woman was robbed and raped by two immigrants after meeting them in a bar. One Iranian is now <a href="http://www.friatider.se/v-ldtogs-brutalt-av-tv-invandrare-i-bil" target="_blank">being prosecuted</a>, while the other man is still at large.</p>
<p>In another recent <a href="http://www.friatider.se/rektorn-bortf-rklarade-tafsningarna-pojkar-r-pojkar-sen-v-ldtog-ali-sin-klasskamrat-p-skolg-rden" target="_blank">case</a>, an African boy is accused of raping a Swedish girl behind a bush in their schoolyard. Swedish girls had been harassed by immigrant boys at the school for a long time, but the faculty didn’t want to intervene. The principal told a concerned father, “you shouldn’t divide people into us and them.”</p>

<p>The case is now under investigation, and the boy, who’s under 15 years old, is still allowed to go to the school.</p>
<h3>Imported rape culture (?)</h3>
<p>So why make such a big deal about immigrants committing crimes? Ethnic Scandinavians do it too, so why put so much focus on immigrants? Isn’t that racist? Well, if immigrants are committing crimes on a scale disproportionate to their numbers, there’s a reason to be alarmed. Rape culture has been non-existent in the West, but maybe it can be imported.</p>
<p>Ingrid Carlqvist is a Swedish journalist who’s lately written extensively on the subject of immigration. <a href="http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/5195/sweden-rape" target="_blank">One of her articles</a>, co-written by Lars Hedegaard, has to do with rape and immigration. The authors make the case that immigration has caused an enormous increase in crime in Sweden, with the number of rapes increasing by a staggering 1,472 percent since 1975, a time when the number of immigrants also started rising.</p>
<p>But you can think of many different explanations for that. One is that third-wave feminism has taught women that basically anything a man does that they don’t like can be considered rape, and we know that their accusations might well be lies.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74410 size-full" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boat1.jpg" alt="boat" width="500" height="332" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boat1.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boat1-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/boat1-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<h4>Immigrants are over-represented</h4>
<p>Carlqvist and Hedegaard counter that by referring to studies showing how immigrant men are over-represented in rape cases. During the 00’s, immigrants committed rape 2.1 to 19.5 times as often as Swedes. In 2002, of those sentenced to at least two years in prison for rape in the court of appeal, 85 percent were foreign born or second-generation immigrants.</p>
<p>The authors write:</p>
<blockquote><p>One possible explanation is that, on average, people from the Middle East have a vastly different view of women and sex than Scandinavians have. And despite the attempts by the Swedish establishment to convince the population that everyone setting foot on Swedish soil becomes exactly like those who have lived here for dozens of generations, facts point in an altogether different direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe the most telling fact about all of this has to do with what the Finnish Prime Minister said after the alleged rape in Kempele; the staff at refugee camps have to tell men how to behave toward women in Finland.</p>
<p>It says a lot about what these immigrants have gotten used to in their native countries. One might wonder how willing they are to give up their old ways (this writer’s guess: not very).</p>
