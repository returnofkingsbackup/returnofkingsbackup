<p class="western">As I prepare to leave this city that I’ve called home for so long (too long, in fact), I can only look back and wonder why I didn’t leave sooner. Roosh immortalized the reputation of this city with his original article, <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/15-reasons-why-toronto-is-the-worst-city-in-north-america-for-men">15 Reasons Why Toronto Is The Worst City In North America For Men</a>. His reason #15 in particular hit hard for me. And it was only then that I finally made up my mind to escape from this hellhole for good.</p>

<p class="western">And as my farewell present, I dedicate this article to all the men who continue to live and struggle here, hoping that they too can open their eyes and realize that they don’t have to bind their fate to this city.</p>
<p class="western">The 15 reasons why Toronto sucks for men:</p>
<h3 class="western">1. The Weather Is Lousy</h3>
<div id="attachment_74419" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-74419" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1297228344470_ORIGINAL.jpg" alt="1297228344470_ORIGINAL" width="500" height="277" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1297228344470_ORIGINAL.jpg 650w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1297228344470_ORIGINAL-300x166.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1297228344470_ORIGINAL-262x145.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1297228344470_ORIGINAL-574x318.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">This is what Toronto looks like four months of every year.</p>
</div>
<p>Among the major cities of the world, Toronto must have one of the largest seasonal temperature difference. The summers can be as hot as high 30’s with humidity (just over 100°F) while winters can drop to as low as -30°C (-22°F) with the frequent wind chills. You can adapt to either heat or cold with time, but not both if they alternate on a yearly basis.</p>
<h3>2. The Transportation System Is Terrible</h3>
<div id="attachment_74440" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-74440" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/biking.jpg" alt="biking" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/biking.jpg 960w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/biking-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/biking-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/biking-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/biking-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/biking-574x323.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Biking in the snow is often more reliable and faster than using our broken public transit system—the TTC.</p>
</div>
<p>When people are not complaining about the weather, you can guarantee that they will complain about the traffic or the public transportation. I’m not exaggerating when I say that Pyongyang probably has a better subway system than Toronto.</p>
<h3>3. People Are Miserable</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74427" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1000-bus-stop.jpg" alt="1000-bus-stop" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1000-bus-stop.jpg 1000w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1000-bus-stop-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1000-bus-stop-837x557.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1000-bus-stop-667x444.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1000-bus-stop-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1000-bus-stop-574x382.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Toronto is often ranked the least happy city of Canada. Everywhere I go, I seem to stumble upon broken individuals who have no energy, are emotionally unstable, have been cheated on, gone through a divorce, are desperately lonely, are depressed and on drugs, etc.</p>
<h3>4. The Sports Teams Suck</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74423" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/leaf-loss.jpg" alt="leaf-loss" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/leaf-loss.jpg 721w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/leaf-loss-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/leaf-loss-667x444.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/leaf-loss-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/leaf-loss-574x382.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The miserable people of Toronto can’t even rely on their sports teams for a bit of joy in life. These teams—particularly the Leafs—only torment their fans with disappointment after disappointment. It’s actually amazing that they never fail to sell out their overpriced tickets no matter how bad they play.</p>
<h3>5. People Are Extremely Fake And Shallow</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74429" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/James-Harrison-Robert-Weir-Chole-Wise-Toronto-Life-Most-Influential-MAIN.jpg" alt="James-Harrison-Robert-Weir-Chole-Wise-Toronto-Life-Most-Influential-MAIN" width="500" height="359" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/James-Harrison-Robert-Weir-Chole-Wise-Toronto-Life-Most-Influential-MAIN.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/James-Harrison-Robert-Weir-Chole-Wise-Toronto-Life-Most-Influential-MAIN-300x216.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/James-Harrison-Robert-Weir-Chole-Wise-Toronto-Life-Most-Influential-MAIN-262x188.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/James-Harrison-Robert-Weir-Chole-Wise-Toronto-Life-Most-Influential-MAIN-574x412.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p class="western">People here seem incredibly desperate to show off how happy and exciting their lives are. The effort they expend to demonstrate their coolness and importance, while obsessing over status, just goes to show how fragile and insecure they really are.</p>
<p class="western">I personally know one chick who is miserable as fuck but can’t seem to stop putting up pictures of herself on Facebook that shows her smiling with gourmet food.</p>
<h3>6. It’s Nearly Impossible To Connect With Genuine (And Normal) People</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74434" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Laura-Maya-Mike-and-Scooter-oasis-aqua-lounge-best-of-.jpg" alt="Laura%20Maya%20Mike%20and%20Scooter%20oasis%20aqua%20lounge%20best%20of%20" width="500" height="274" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Laura-Maya-Mike-and-Scooter-oasis-aqua-lounge-best-of-.jpg 620w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Laura-Maya-Mike-and-Scooter-oasis-aqua-lounge-best-of--300x165.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Laura-Maya-Mike-and-Scooter-oasis-aqua-lounge-best-of--262x144.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Laura-Maya-Mike-and-Scooter-oasis-aqua-lounge-best-of--574x315.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Following up on #5, good luck trying to make real friends or having any semblance of meaningful relationships. Even when you find somewhat normal individuals who are not freaks, you will be expected to deal with constant flaking, lying, broken promises, and back-stabbings. Here, other human beings are just objects to be used to feed one’s ego.</p>
<p>To be fair, I have met some truly kind and decent people here, but they are few and hard to come by.</p>
<h3>7. Many People Are Afflicted With Toronto Syndrome</h3>
<p class="western"><img class="alignnone wp-image-74436" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pride_painted.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_.jpg" alt="pride_painted.jpg.size.xxlarge.promo" width="500" height="335" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pride_painted.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_.jpg 545w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pride_painted.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_-300x201.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/pride_painted.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_-262x175.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p class="western">Toronto Syndrome is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-purchase_rationalization">post-purchase rationalization</a> or Stockholm syndrome where people—when taken hostage to a city as awful as Toronto for a long enough time—start to rationalize and grow attached to the city that is clearly sub-par and outright degenerate.</p>
<p class="western">This is evidenced by the rabid fanaticism of Torontonians who claim that their city is the “best” in the world without any basis whatsoever. These zealots will denounce you and bark at you for not sharing their rainbow delusion that Toronto is a utopia (I suppose it is if you’re gay).</p>

</div>
<h3>8. The Women Are Bratty And Obnoxious</h3>
<div id="attachment_74438" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-74438" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/feminist.jpg" alt="feminist" width="500" height="335" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/feminist.jpg 545w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/feminist-300x201.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/feminist-262x175.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">The Toronto feminist who got a man fired from his job, banned from the internet for two years, had his reputation ruined, with a possibility of a jail time. And all because he argued with her over on Twitter.</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not sure what makes women here think the world owes them royal treatment considering how little value they have to offer. Their snarky demeanor and entitlement complex is well known in the manosphere and there’s even an entire <a href="http://livinginthedeadcity.weebly.com/archive/archives/12-2011">blog</a> dedicated to the subject.</p>
<p>Many foreign girls from outside of Canada have much more pleasant looks and attitude than the harpies who were born here. But the longer they stay here, the more they go native.</p>
<h3>9. <b>Women Use Their Headphones As Shields</b>
</h3>
<div id="attachment_74439" style="width: 458px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-74439 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/phoneshield.jpeg" alt="phoneshield" width="448" height="326" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/phoneshield.jpeg 448w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/phoneshield-300x218.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/phoneshield-262x191.jpeg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Headphones + Eyes on iPhone – Smile = “Fuck off, don’t talk to me.”</p>
</div>
<p class="western">One of the most popular topics of conversation for women in Toronto is to bitch about how men would dare to approach them even though they had their headphones on. One girl admitted to me that she sometimes wear them even though she’s not listening to anything just so she could repel men.</p>
<p class="western">I don’t know what’s sadder: men being so thirsty or women shooing them away like flies.</p>
<h3>10. It’s A Hotbed Of Progressivism</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74424" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto.jpg" alt="117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto" width="500" height="330" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto.jpg 1170w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto-300x198.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto-837x552.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto-667x440.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto-262x173.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/117268-people-take-part-in-the-slutwalk-protest-in-toronto-574x379.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Mass of immigrants, homosexuals, trannies, feminists, SJWs, the militant Left, and all the rest are all concentrated right here in Toronto. Toronto isn’t infected with progressivism, it <em>is</em> the disease. I live in constant fear of saying the wrong thing and facing a backlash for it.</p>
<h3>11. It’s A Boring City With Boring People</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74441" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015623-outdoormovies.jpg" alt="2015623-outdoormovies" width="500" height="332" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015623-outdoormovies.jpg 590w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015623-outdoormovies-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015623-outdoormovies-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015623-outdoormovies-574x381.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Possibly due to the long winters, Toronto is an incredibly boring city where the only hobby people seem to have is to watch television shows, going to the movies, and… talking about them. I don’t know how many times I’ve been asked whether I watch <em>Game of Thrones</em> or the latest Hollywood trash, only to have these people go talk to someone else when I tell them no.</p>
<h3>12. The City Has No Soul</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74442" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20081201_toronto.jpg" alt="20081201_toronto" width="500" height="425" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20081201_toronto.jpg 590w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20081201_toronto-300x255.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20081201_toronto-262x222.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20081201_toronto-574x487.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Toronto has no history and no culture, and therefore no identity to speak of. This is what happens when you flood a city with people from all over the world. Multiculturalism and diversity is like mixing food from all over the world into a single dish; the end result is always an unrecognizable pile of rubbish.</p>
<h3>13. There Is No Economy</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74425" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/condo27.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_.jpg" alt="condo27.jpg.size.xxlarge.promo" width="500" height="335" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/condo27.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_.jpg 545w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/condo27.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_-300x201.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/condo27.jpg.size_.xxlarge.promo_-262x175.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>While Toronto has one the most highly educated populations in the world, there are no real jobs to speak of. The city only grows because of its continuous influx of immigrants who were lured in by false promises of prosperity. This is apparent from the fact that the only people making good money are those who build and sell the endless number of condos here.</p>
<h3>14. It’s Full Of Entitled Crybabies</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-74435" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494.jpg" alt="B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494.jpg 878w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/B_g-GOaU8AILv4Z.jpg-large-878x494-574x323.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>You would think that all the social programs here would make people feel grateful for what they are given, but it couldn’t be farther from the truth. Disabled people complain all the time despite the fact that they receive special treatment unseen in rest of the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people of a certain colour lie about their income and social status to maximize their benefits and access to services. This may explain why a disturbing number of people are actively seeking their own victim status, with the more deranged ones purposely mutilating themselves by claiming to be ‘<a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/becoming-disabled-by-choice-not-chance-transabled-people-feel-like-impostors-in-their-fully-working-bodies">transabled</a>‘.</p>

<p>Toronto is a failed social experiment. It’s almost as if the elites decided to flood the place with immigrants, introduce feminism and flamboyant homosexuality, and see how far things go before everything collapses—much like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z760XNy4VM">mice utopia</a> experiment done by John B. Calhoun.</p>
<p>People often think that Sweden is on its way to collapse as the first casualty in the West, but I disagree. Sweden is far more robust with its core European population who can easily turn things around should they finally wake up. The same cannot be said for Toronto and much of Canada.</p>

<p>I fully expect this city to bust once potential immigrants stop coming here after finally realizing that it’s a city built on lies with no future to speak of. As for myself, I have no desire to sit and wait for the shit to hit the fan. I have no reason to stay in this wretched city; I want to experience life in places with better climate and nicer women.</p>
<p>Adiós Toronto!</p>
