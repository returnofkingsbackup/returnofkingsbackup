<p>As much as I would like to be optimistic that the current social order will soon crumble and give way to a return to patriarchy, traditionalism, and masculine virtues, I think that unfortunately the pendulum will continue to swing even further to the left before it starts to swing back.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of that scene from The Simpsons where Police Chief Wiggum gets his tie caught in the hot dog rolling machine at the Kwik-E-Mart and says, “This is going to get worse before it gets better.”</p>
<p><a title="" href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wiggum.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-75282 alignnone" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wiggum.jpg" alt="wiggum" width="423" height="325"></a></p>
<p>The key to being a good futurist is being able to entertain scenarios that one doesn’t necessarily want to see come to pass. Sound prognostication is based on the ability to divest oneself from the matter at hand and deal with issues in an objective and impersonal manner. It also becomes increasingly difficult to accurately anticipate trends the further out one looks.</p>
<p>Predictions about what life will be like 100 years in the future are almost always comically wrong. Consequently, I constrain myself in this article to events that I think will come to pass in the near future. Here then are five predictions for what I think we will see in the United States in the next decade or two.</p>
<h3>1. There will be a large increase in the number of male-to-female (M2F) transsexuals.</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/admiral-ackbar.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-75277 alignnone" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/admiral-ackbar-300x160.jpg" alt="admiral ackbar" width="465" height="248" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/admiral-ackbar-300x160.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/admiral-ackbar-262x140.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/admiral-ackbar.jpg 307w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"></a></p>
<p>We will see a dramatic uptick in the number of males undergoing sexual reassignment surgery. Those who are young boys now will have grown up marinating in a culture that is openly anti-male. They will have grown up seeing the adoration bestowed upon women by society for no other reason than for being women. They will not have failed to notice the countless free passes and dispensations given to women.</p>
<p>This has, in fact, been offered as an explanation for what motivated Bruce Jenner to become Caitlyn: he envied how the media lavished attention on his daughters and step daughters while his Olympic triumphs were long forgotten and no longer meant anything to the world. It’s natural to want to be on the winning team. Why not play for the team that starts off with a huge point advantage, doesn’t get called on fouls or for traveling, and scores 10 points per basket to your 1?</p>
<p>Moreover, massive immigration that consists overwhelmingly of young assertive males who can use the <em>muh culture</em> excuse for any inappropriately forward or lascivious behavior will make competition for existing women even fiercer. It will be seen as much easier to <em>be</em> a woman than to <em>get</em> a woman.</p>
<p>There’s actually a precedent for this in nature: when female parrotfish are kept in a single-sex environment with no males, the largest and most dominant female parrotfish spontaneously change gender and become male. Also, it’s well established that some males will assume a female role when confined to a single sex environment for an extended period of time, e.g., mariners and prisoners.</p>
<h3>2. More spree killers</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/columbine.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-75278 alignnone" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/columbine-300x225.jpg" alt="columbine" width="475" height="356" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/columbine-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/columbine-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/columbine.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 475px) 100vw, 475px"></a></p>
<p>While some frustrated young men will ease their sexual frustration and social isolation by gender bending, others will lash out violently against the society from which they feel alienated and blame for their lack of happiness. Expect more Breiviks, Chos, Klebolds, Lanzas, Rogers, and Roofs. Growing frustration, rage, and despair will drive more young men to seek revenge against real or perceived injustices.</p>
<p>Inability to get a girlfriend was explicitly mentioned as a primary motivation in Elliot Rodger and Chris Harper-Mercer’s rampage killings. But not a single spree killer of the past 15 years was known to have been in a physical relationship with a woman. Most – if not all – were virgins. One of the Columbine shooters, Eric Harris, even mused in his journal, that “maybe I just need to get laid.” Spree killings will become increasingly common over the next decade or two.</p>
<p>And it will not make any difference if guns are confiscated or outlawed. With the proliferation of drones, those committed to wreaking havoc can do it in far more creative ways than with a gun. I imagine something along the lines of Bill Williamson driving a remote-controlled truck bomb into a police station in Uwe Boll’s <em>Rampage</em>.</p>

<h3>3. Hillary Clinton will be elected the next President of the United States</h3>
<p><a title="" href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-75279 alignnone" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary-300x218.jpg" alt="hillary" width="517" height="376" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary-300x218.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary-837x608.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary-667x484.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary-262x190.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary-574x417.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hillary.jpg 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px"></a></p>
<p>Likely, for two terms. She has the support of women, minorities, and a good number of liberal white men. Even if Trump could win the support of all white men, he cannot win the election. The numbers just aren’t there. Politicians know that they no longer have to cater to white males. White male voters can no longer decide the outcome of elections. If you secure the female vote, you win. Secure the minority vote as well and it’s a landslide victory. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>George W. Bush will go down in history as the last straight white man to serve as President of the United States. The first black president will be followed by the first female president, likely followed by the first openly gay president. Look at how Ben Carson pulled ahead of Donald Trump in Idaho in recent polls. Idaho! White men are now seen as unelectable in their own country.</p>
<p>Expect Republicans and Democrats to run opposing black candidates. It will be our black candidate versus their black candidate, sort of like how the Space Race pitted America’s German rocket scientists against the Soviet Union’s German rocket scientists.</p>
<h3>4. The government will crack down on homeschooling</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/home-schooling.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-75280 alignnone" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/home-schooling-300x179.jpg" alt="home schooling" width="548" height="327" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/home-schooling-300x179.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/home-schooling-262x156.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/home-schooling-574x342.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/home-schooling.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></a></p>
<p>Expect either the outright banning of homeschooling or the enacting of intrusive regulations. Government inspectors may sit in on homeschooling classes to ensure political correctness is observed. They may mandate the teaching of certain doctrines regarding history or gender relations. The system will not allow any young minds to escape indoctrination.</p>
<p>Expect the government to mandate that even home schooled children learn about homosexuality, the oppressive patriarchy, and the evils of white people. Expect curricula to be dictated; for instance, Henrik Ibsen’s feminist play, <em>A Doll’s House,</em> may become required reading for homeschooled children.</p>
<p>The federal government will intervene under the pretense of protecting children. Expect parents who homeschool their children to be derided as reactionaries with questionable motives and even labeled mentally abusive. It’s no coincidence that the only country in the world (Sweden) to ban homeschooling is also the most ideologically suicidal and the most culturally self-loathing.</p>
<h3>5. Employers will be forced to pay for female workers to freeze their eggs</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ivf.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-75281 alignnone" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ivf-300x462.jpg" alt="ivf" width="310" height="477" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ivf-300x462.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ivf-262x404.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ivf.jpg 301w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px"></a></p>
<p>As women continue to be installed in top positions in government, academia, and the corporate world, expect the next push to be for mandatory coverage of egg freezing procedures. Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Apple are already offering their female employees these services free of charge so they may focus on climbing the corporate ladder rather than heeding their ticking biological clock.</p>
<p>We’ve recently seen how employers were forced to cover birth control for their female employees. Birth control is a lifestyle choice. No one is forcing women to engage in sexual activity. Yet employers are required to pay for it just the same.</p>
<p>With subsidized egg freezing allowing more and more women to postpone motherhood into their 30s and 40s, expect a concomitant rise in the number of sickly children. Expect more autistics and aspies. The incidence of autism will continue to rise. From 1 in 500 in 1950 to 1 in 250 in 1990 to 1 in 50 today to 1 in 10 or worse in 10 to 15 years. Having healthy children will become an increasing rarity.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>My intention in writing this article is not to cause ROK readers further lamentation or despair. But hoping that the future will somehow miraculously improve is naive and downright dangerous. It’s like hoping that a listing ship will suddenly right itself in the middle of a raging storm.</p>
