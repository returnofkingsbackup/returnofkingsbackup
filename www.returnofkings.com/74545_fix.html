<p>In a <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/11/20/40-of-millennials-ok-with-limiting-speech-offensive-to-minorities/">recent Pew Research poll</a>, 40% of American millennials favor limiting offensive speech, in particularly speech offensive to minorities. The problem with limiting speech is that it can be a slippery slope as to what is deemed okay and what is deemed offensive. As we all know, it MUST fit the narrative to be deemed acceptable speech.</p>
<p>Although there are already hate speech laws in Europe, the numbers are even higher across the Atlantic Ocean. You would think with the current issues that millennials, especially college students, face on a day-to-day basis that their mind would be occupied with more pressing issues, but you would be wrong. College debt, terrorism, and a depressed job market apparently aren’t as important as policing your words. There are a few reasons why I believe that millennials don’t want you to say or think anything that is deemed offensive by society.</p>
<h3>Lack Of Argument Skills</h3>
<p>We all (should) know this by now. Individuals who lack basic argument skills usually turn to name calling, logical fallacies, or antagonizing when they lose an argument. They do this so that they can silence the opponent in an argument.</p>
<p>With an untrustworthy mainstream media, it is hard to gather hard facts that can be debunked. Nowadays we have a new method of silencing the opponent: literally SILENCING the opponent. To hell with the first amendment.</p>
<h3>Growing Up In Smaller Households (At Most Two Siblings)</h3>
<div id="attachment_74597" style="width: 605px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="size-full wp-image-74597" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2007_ROMNEY_family_picture-0.jpg" alt="This type of family is much less common nowadays" width="595" height="383" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2007_ROMNEY_family_picture-0.jpg 595w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2007_ROMNEY_family_picture-0-300x193.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2007_ROMNEY_family_picture-0-262x169.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2007_ROMNEY_family_picture-0-574x369.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px"><p class="wp-caption-text">This type of family is much less common nowadays</p>
</div>
<p>During the baby boomer era, it was common for children to grow up with several brothers and sisters. Within a large family, a child does not get much of a voice. Their opinions must be muted and they must bite their lip, not necessarily because their parents were the thought police, but to avoid conflict within the family. They learned to accept diverse opinions of their family members.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it’s very common for millennials to grow up as the only child. When they had an opinion or a dream, their parents support it, no matter how kooky it may be. Parents these days are taught to always support their children’s dreams, which leave the child without any sort of opposing thoughts.</p>
<p>Place that same child in a real world diverse setting, such as a public university, they cannot cope with the fact that others may disagree with them (or think that they are outright delusional).</p>
<h3>Lack Of Power</h3>
<p>Every day the western leaders get stronger, the citizens get weaker. Their votes count less and less, leaving them feeling powerless and voiceless. Their opinions seem to be irrelevant. If they happen to agree with the politically correct narrative, however, then the only issue is making sure everyone else is on board with their delusions and those who aren’t remain silent.</p>
<p>I’m sure you wonder why rap music, particularly that made by Black Americans, is virtually immune to scrutiny. I’ve wondered this for a while myself. If you watched Roosh’s video of the Georgetown “Black Lives Matter” protest, he mentions that around 50% of the participants were indeed white.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>What were they doing there you ask? Did the white participants actually care about black lives? Of course not. They cared about one thing and one thing only: the politically correct narrative and silencing anyone who disagrees with it.</p>
<p>The reason why rap music never receives criticism is because it would come off as antagonizing towards blacks, which is who the left needs in order to help enforce their ideology. They excuse the misbehavior of blacks and minorities in hope to gain their support.</p>
<p>Kinda like the one parent that lets you stay up late or eat cookies when the other parent isn’t around. If the left really cared about black lives, they would tackle issues that affect them, offensive speech not being one of them.</p>
<p>In fact, I would go as far as to say that they encourage behaviors that hurt black America. You think rap music, “Black Lives Matter” protests, welfare, feminist indoctrination that drives the women to choose single motherhood, <a href="http://stateofobesity.org/disparities/blacks/">obesity</a>, excessive use of the N-word, and ignoring high murder rates in their neighborhoods helps Black America in any way? This is how they successfully gain power over Black Americans and other minorities as well.</p>
<h3>Political Correctness Indoctrination At An Early Age</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-74596" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Erziehung-zur-Political-Correctness.jpg" alt="Erziehung-zur-Political-Correctness" width="448" height="336" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Erziehung-zur-Political-Correctness.jpg 448w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Erziehung-zur-Political-Correctness-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Erziehung-zur-Political-Correctness-262x197.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"></p>
<p>We see this in our media, our schools, and sometimes, even our churches. Children these days are exposed to political correctness at a very early age, and this ties everything above together into one free speech limiting bundle.</p>
<p>Think about it like this: if you were told that there were certain guidelines as to what you can and cannot say in public, wouldn’t you think that the same should apply to everyone else? This obviously doesn’t apply to the decreasing amount of politically incorrect households that raise their children traditionally, but to the children raised in far left households, they feel obligated to make sure that everyone else follows the rules of limited speech that they have been taught to abide by their entire lives.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I don’t believe that millennials are to blame entirely for their views on free speech. Sure, they have internet access via laptops and smartphones to where they can look up other viewpoints, but when they have had a certain indoctrination embedded in their brains their entire life, along with coddling parents and lack of argument skills. In a society so diverse they feel voiceless, it shouldn’t be a mystery as to why they can’t handle opposing views.</p>
<p>We can point the blame at many other people for this phenomenon of entitled millennials, but that won’t solve the issue. The problem is not those who make a living off of the freedom of speech, but those who are unaffected by political correctness. The majority of Americans tend to be moderates who do not have such views that by society’s standards are deemed to be politically incorrect, so therefore they are likely to not pay any attention to this issue.</p>
<p>I’m afraid to say that until this trend starts to affect the majority of the population, it will only get worse.</p>
