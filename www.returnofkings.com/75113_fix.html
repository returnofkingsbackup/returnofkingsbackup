<p>Height, like race, sex, or facial appearance, is something that you’re born with and have very little control over. It also factors into how people perceive you and how you feel about yourself. From the famous “Tall CEOs make more money” canard to the stereotype of the tall guy getting all the girls, it’s a well accepted truth in game and in life that tall men have things just a little bit easier.</p>
<p>Whether it’s due to evolutionary preference for taller men, societal conditioning, or some combination, many of us have caught ourselves looking at our taller friends from time to time and wishing that we had a couple more inches.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the ways that people with above average height have a slightly easier road than the rest of us, and a tip about how shorter guys can even the playing field:</p>
<h3>1. Increased confidence</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Confident.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-57294" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Confident-300x200.jpg" alt="Confident" width="404" height="269" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Confident-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Confident-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Confident.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px"></a></p>
<p>Towering over someone enables you to be more confident. Perhaps this is a deep-rooted reaction of our animal ancestors, whose main qualification for dominance of their domain was their physical stature.</p>
<p>We constantly see taller guys who are more able to approach women and best others in many types of athletic competition. There are obvious exceptions to this (sports like wrestling, polo, etc.), but a deficit in height is something that many men have to overcome internally even more than externally. The world around them tells them they are less adequate for being short in stature, and they must get out of their own heads to compete with the natural confidence of the taller guys.</p>
<h3>2. More attention from women</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/The-Importance-of-Self-Confident-Body-Language-to-Attract-Women.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-28042" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/01/The-Importance-of-Self-Confident-Body-Language-to-Attract-Women.jpg" alt="The-Importance-of-Self-Confident-Body-Language-to-Attract-Women" width="506" height="319"></a></p>
<p>Have you ever gone out with a much taller friend and noticed that girls seem to gravitate to them more? You’re not imagining things. The OKCupid data blog studied this issue, and found that taller men get <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating/">more unsolicited messages</a>. They also found the following nugget about sex partners:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for whether it even makes sense for people to make such an obvious and easily disproved exaggeration, the jury is out. We’ve found that taller people, up to a point, have more sex.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, and likely as a response to this intuitive understanding, height the number one thing people lie about on their online dating profiles:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost universally guys like to add a couple inches. You can also see a more subtle vanity at work: starting at roughly 5′ 8″, the top of the dotted curve tilts even further rightward. This means that guys <i>as they get closer to six feet</i> round up a bit more than usual, stretching for that coveted psychological benchmark.</p></blockquote>
<p>While everybody seems to be exaggerating everything online these days, height is the one thing that consistently gives men a clear edge over the dating competition.</p>
<h3>3. You Make More Money</h3>

<p>Many studies have found that taller people, on average, <a href="http://www.livescience.com/5552-taller-people-earn-money.html">earn more</a> than their shorter counterparts.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our estimates suggest that if the average man of about 178 centimeters [5 feet 10 inches] gains an additional five centimeters [2 inches] in height, he would be able to earn an extra $950 per year – which is approximately equal to the wage gain from one extra year of labor market experience,” said study co-author Andrew Leigh, an economist at the Australian National University.</p></blockquote>
<p>Taller people are also more likely to be perceived as <a href="http://www.eremedia.com/ere/the-halo-effect-the-tall-people-are-coming-for-you-and-your-gut-feeling/">having other good qualities</a> regardless of their actual abilities.</p>
<h3>4. Easier life overall</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-64461" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family-300x199.jpg" alt="happy-family" width="418" height="277" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family-1200x795.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family-837x555.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family-667x442.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/happy-family-574x380.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 418px) 100vw, 418px"></a></p>
<p>Even factoring out the specific factors here, taller people rate their happiness <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/taller-people-are-happier-especially-if-theyre-male/">as being higher:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>As you can see, there’s a pretty steady relationship between well-being and height for men. The taller men are, generally speaking, the happier they are. (Remember, as always, correlation is not causation.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are numerous was an average or shorter man can improve his stock and compete with his larger brothers. If you’re a shorter guy, everything we preach related to game and self-improvement is about doing the work necessary to address any of your perceived deficiencies. As many interesting men can tell you, “height privilege” can be overcome by hard work, learning social skills, and cultivating interesting hobbies.</p>
<p>However, if you’re a guy looking for an immediate slight advantage over the competition, you may want to give yourself a boost. A new product,  <a href="http://www.addheight.com/?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">Add Height</a><sup>™</sup>, can help you discreetly gain a couple of inches of height without having to wear bulky shoes, high heels or boots.</p>
