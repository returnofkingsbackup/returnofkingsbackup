<p><em>The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://voxday.blogspot.com/">Vox Day’s</a> new book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B018ZHHA52/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B018ZHHA52&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=rok0f-20&amp;linkId=Y2GJXGNJZJLPVQTQ">Cuckservative: How “Conservatives” Betrayed America</a>.</em></p>
<p>For most of the 50 years since the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, it has been an article of faith for Democrats and Republicans alike that more immigration, and more diversity, was good for this “Nation of Immigrants”. But in 2015, a well-funded American presidential candidate called this 50-year narrative into question for the first time by vowing to deport all 12 million illegal immigrants within two years, shut down the annual $53 billion flow of remittances to Mexico and other Latin American countries, and use the money to fund an impenetrable wall across the length of the southern border. As a result, Donald Trump shot to the top of the polls and shocked the world by becoming the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
<p>Nor was Trump the only outsider to use immigration as a way to surmount the many challenges posed to those who take on the American political establishment. In the Democratic Party, former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was widely assumed to be the rightful successor to Barack Obama, but U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the socialist from Vermont, correctly called into question the false assumption that immigration creates new jobs for native workers and rode that pro-labor position into early leads in the Iowa and New Hampshire polls.</p>
<p>These developments indicate a massive shift in public opinion over the course of the last decade. David Brooks of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>New York Times</em><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>observed that there hadn’t been much difference between how Democrats and Republicans viewed overall immigration levels during the Bush 43 administration, before lamenting that 84 percent of Republicans and 44 percent of Democrats now believe they are excessive.</p>
<p>What is now taking place in Europe is a microcosm of what is happening, on a larger scope and timescale, in the United States of America. Although the European population of 508 million is larger than the U.S. population of 320 million, the 28 member nations of the E.U. fit into about half the land taken up by the 50 united States. Moreover, unlike the heterogeneous American “nation of immigrants”, the European nations are homogeneous and distinct, with long histories, traditions, and collective memories that stretch back for centuries. That is why a much smaller number of immigrants arriving in a much shorter period of time has triggered the powerful nationalistic response that is already overturning governments and will ultimately shatter the European Union.</p>

<p>That is why it is important to realize that the same divisive process is well underway in the United States, albeit at a larger order of magnitude. And one of the tragic ironies of American politics is that it is the very group of people who most proudly proclaim their loyalty to the U.S. Constitution and to the traditional values of America’s founding fathers, conservatives, who have helped lead the way to America’s decline and eventual collapse. They have done so by forgetting the central purpose of the very document they revere.</p>
<p>The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States of America contains an extremely important phrase that is almost always ignored by those who appeal to it, or to the men who wrote it, in defense of immigration. It states:</p>
<blockquote><p>We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.</p></blockquote>
<p>The key phrase is this: “to ourselves and our posterity.” The blessings of liberty are not to be secured to all the nations of the world, to the tired and huddled masses, or to the wretched refuse of the teeming shores of other lands. They are to be secured to our children, and their children, and their children’s children.</p>
<p>To sacrifice their interests to the interests of children in other lands is to betray both past and future America. It is to permit an alien posterity, like the newly hatched cuckoo in another bird’s nest, to eliminate our own, and in doing so, defeat the purpose of the Constitution. It is, like the cuckolded husband, to raise the children of another man instead of one’s own sons and daughters.</p>
<p>It is, in a word,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><em>cuckservative</em>.</p>
