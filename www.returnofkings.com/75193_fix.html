<p>It’s common in these parts to make fun of women for having a delusional shopping list when seeking out a mate, but is it possible that our lists for finding women are also unreasonable? I asked myself this question while constructing a list of requirements I need in a woman who I think would be suitable for reproduction (and not necessarily state-sanctioned marriage). I ask you, dear reader, if my list is as deranged as that of a woman’s.</p>
<p>The following is what I require in a woman for a long-term relationship that involves having children:</p>
<h4>1. She must be between 18-25 years old</h4>
<p>In the case I want to have more than two kids, I need to find a woman who is substantially younger than myself so she is biologically able to keep popping them out. This requirement also accounts for the fact that single women over 25 are emotionally damaged in some way, are alpha widowed, or are professional daters who are incapable of making the proper relationship sacrifices.</p>
<h4>2. She must have less than three prior sexual partners, though I prefer a virgin</h4>
<p>Studies show that the more sexual partners a woman has before marriage, the more likely <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00444.x/abstract">that marriage will fail</a>. I also don’t want to marry a woman who has voluntarily accepted being used as a cum dumpster by other men, or who kisses my child with lips that have been previously wrapped around many other cocks. My child will not have a “reformed” slut mother.</p>
<p>For a woman who has had sexual partners before me, I must be the absolute best man she has ever been with in terms of appearance, personality, and resources. Otherwise, once the honeymoon is over and the relationship hits an inevitable low point, she will get a “Could I have done better?” itch and sabotage the relationship or test me to the point where I have to play “<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/dont-let-a-girl-use-dread-game-on-you">dread game</a>” just to keep her in the kitchen. There must be no doubt within her mind that I am the best that she could possibly get.</p>
<h4>3. Her physical attractiveness should hover around the 7 range</h4>
<p>Thanks to technology and modern cosmopolitan society, a woman who is an 8 or above in beauty has been exposed to more toxic situations and experiences where she’s achieved some level of e-fame, been validated incessantly for her appearance, and been offered money, consumer products, and trips for her vagina (and likely accepted those offers). She has also fully utilitized her beauty to get her way in life, including prime seating for manipulating men for personal gain. Not only is such a woman harder to manage, but her entitlement is far higher. For a life partner I will purposefully aim lower than what I could get for casual sex.</p>
<h4>4. Her skin tone should be within two shades of myself</h4>
<p>I would like to have kids that look like me, so I will not reproduce with a woman who is black, Asian, or Indian. Acceptable races are South American, Persian, Armenian, and European (non-Northern). The average Croatian or Romanian girl is more similar to my appearance than Spanish or Italian.</p>
<h4>5. She must be feminine</h4>
<p>She must be a woman who takes great pride in her appearance and the feminine abilities that nature bestowed upon her. I don’t want her to be a mindless weakling who needs me all the time, but she should look and act like a woman and not try to compete with me in terms of mental or physical strength.</p>

</div>
<h4>6. She must want to be a traditional stay-at-home mother</h4>
<p>Once the kids arrive, she should have no desire to pursue a pointless office career in place of taking care of our growing brood. She may have some freedom to pursue hobbies like yoga or knitting, but her place will be in the home while I tirelessly work on my internet ebook hustle to bring home the bread that gives her everything she needs.</p>
<p>When I come home from work (at the cafe), I expect the kids to be clean, the house to be in good order, and preparations for dinner planned. I shall not participate in more than 5% of household duties outside of home improvement. In exchange, she will never have to worry about money or work outside the home. She can live a pleasant middle-class lifestyle that can even include dog and car ownership.</p>
<h4>7. She must believe in a god</h4>
<p>My experience shows that a woman who doesn’t believe in god has a value system taught to her by corporations and progressive degenerates. She will certainly be addicted to internet attention, alcohol, casual sex, material possessions, or food. She has relativistic morality, and what she thinks of as morality is actually built upon her feelings. When faced with any type of stress, she will almost always follow the herd or make the wrong decision. A woman who believes in god, while still prone to making mistakes, makes less of them and at least has a mental system encouraging her to perform good.</p>
<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p>I believe the seven things above are quite reasonable, and something that would have taken no more than a 6-month search two generations ago, but based on my last decade of intensive fornication, I’ve encountered maybe two girls who fit the bill, especially when it comes to girls being a virgin and eager to stay at home. Part of this reason is that most of my time hunting for women was spent in big cities where such values are rapidly disappearing.</p>
<p>The decision I have to make now is how badly I want kids. If I don’t want kids, I should live in a place like Poland where I can attain a comfortable life of easy sex with “strong and independent” sluts, but where it’s close to impossible to meet girls who meet the above requirements (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBWu5oyAZ3k">in the Polish cities I have lived in</a>). If I do want to have kids, I should immediately move, because I’m surely not getting any younger. The two countries that seem to best accomplish my list are Ukraine and Russia, though there are huge obstacles and difficulties with living there long term instead of just going for two months of adventure and fun.</p>
<p>While I can honestly state that I’m not crazy about having kids right now, I know that my desires can change and so I have to guess <em>if</em> I will want them within five years time. Only five years ago I was still in the middle of <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-7-stages-of-being-a-player">nonstop casual sex</a>, thinking the party would never end, and of course the music did stop and it’s something that no longer drives me. If being a father is in my future, I must prepare for it now.</p>
