<p>I’ve been seeing a lot of comments from men wondering why allowing homosexuals to marry in the United States in such a big deal. “Let them do what they want, it doesn’t affect us,” they say. I wish that was the case. Not only is the legalization of gay marriage a full frontal attack on heterosexual men, it is part of a larger war to remove legal rights and behaviors that you are currently able to enjoy without state or mob interference.</p>
<p>Legalizing gay marriage is one phase of a degenerate march to persecute heterosexuals, both legally and socially, while acclimating young children to the homosexual lifestyle. The Supreme Court ruling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obergefell_v._Hodges">in June 2015</a> allowing gay marriage doesn’t affect your life one hour, one day, or one month after, but it is part of a long war that <em>will</em> eventually criminalize or socially forbid certain aspects of heterosexual behavior at the same time it over-sexualizes young children in order to introduce them to homosexuality. I absolutely guarantee that your life will be negatively affected from the fallout of this ruling within a 5-10 year timespan.</p>
<p>The reason for this is simple: the societal reorganization that is necessary to allow gay marriage automatically elevates homosexuals to a special class of citizenry. To hoist one class you must demote another, meaning that heterosexual men are by default the enemies and oppressors of homosexuals. It is a foregone conclusion that these oppressors, which includes both straight men and women, must be ordered to give tribute, benefits, and submission to the “victim” class. You will eventually kneel whether you like it or not.</p>
<p>Masculine and straight behavior will be more aggressively modified through social shaming and re-education in schools, where young boys will be enthusiastically taught the superiority of homosexual lifestyles and the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/17501/america-is-becoming-a-homosexual-nation">shameful privilege of heterosexuals</a>, especially concerning the types of relationships that lead to nuclear, stable families. In addition, straight men will be forced under the barrel of the state’s gun to pay taxes for the AIDS drugs of gays, <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/sex-change-surgery-health-care-coverage-108853">their impulsive sex changes</a>, their mental and medical treatments resulting from sleeping with hundreds of partners, and also the salaries of politicians that continue to vote against traditional family values and basic morality standards. Your tax money already goes to Planned Parenthood and pharmaceutical companies to sterilize the female population so what’s a few more billion more to empower gays to continue their bathhouse behavior?</p>
<p>I’m also certain that gays will be exempt from dystopian divorce laws. Men’s rights activists genuinely think that allowing gays to marry will somehow put the spotlight on straight men getting raped in courts by women, but nothing of the sort will happen. Instead, courts will use two separate books. Gay marriages will be dissolved in an equal manner right down the middle while straight men will continued to be screwed by the system. We’re already seeing this dual-book approach with yes-means-yes rape laws that are entirely focused on persecuting men for consensual sex while letting women off the hook for sleeping with drunk men (<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62467/new-york-has-adopted-yes-means-yes">1</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/58394/yes-means-yes-comes-to-london">2</a>, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/56506/hawaii-has-adopted-yes-means-yes">3</a>). Theoretically, yes-means-yes laws should apply to women just as equally, but we all know it won’t, as any man who gets physically assaulted by a woman in public already knows how dangerous it is to fight back to defend himself. Due process was long ago eliminated to favor women, and now it will favor homosexuals.</p>
<p>The increasing limits on heterosexual free speech was clearly shown in my Berlin lecture this summer. I had to hide the venue until the day before to prevent the sort of left-wing censorship that a month later led to thousands of Canadians <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/69013/how-roosh-v-won-the-battle-of-montreal">trying to ban me from the country</a>. On the day of the Berlin lecture, one block away from the hotel, there was a massive gay pride parade where half-naked men under the influence of alcohol and drugs were dancing and humping each other like they were in a nightclub. They dressed up at least one midget as a gimp and put him on a leash. Their hypersexual displays was done out in the open, in full view of families who picked the wrong day to go for a walk in the city, while a group of forty men including myself had to conceal their own behavior and essentially hide in one room, even though the content of my entire speech was more family friendly that witnessing even one minute of the homo display.</p>

<p>Within all the work, school, or co-ed social groups you’re a member of, denigrating the nuclear family or masculinity will not get you ostracized or fired. You can make a comment about “toxic masculinity” at work and not get written up by human resources. You can make fun of “lame pick up artists” in your co-ed social circle and get pats on the back. But what happens if you say that homosexuals <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/39739/male-homosexuals-have-become-a-public-health-threat">are degenerates who are spreading HIV</a> to the general population? What happens if you say gay marriage is state-sponsored anal sex? What happens if you say that children should be raised in a nuclear family? You already know the answer. It won’t be long until you will be <em>forced</em> to declare your allegiance to the homosexual lifestyle to retain your job, to pretend that you’re a believer in social justice just to keep bread on the table.</p>
<p>Even more sinister than modifying our speech and behavior is that the homosexual agenda aims to convert children by sexualizing them at a young age. The media normalizes homosexuals as loving and lively characters by showing their lifestyles as exciting, adventurous, and fun instead of the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/3882/the-truth-about-aids">disease-ridden cesspool</a> of drugs and medical horrors that it really is. Millions of boys who grow up to experiment with “cool” anal sex thanks to the propaganda will grow up to lead sterile and disturbed lives because of it—if they’re lucky enough not to avoid getting abused through adoptions by homosexual men.</p>
<p>Child abuse and pedophilic sex rings will skyrocket, but I hope you’re not expecting this abuse to be covered by the media. Instead, they will push fantastical new rape hoaxes that try to portray straight men as evil. Crimes by homosexuals will be not be pursued or publicized while false crimes done by heterosexuals will be manufactured. Homosexual crimes won’t even be properly recorded by government bureaucrats—statistics on abuse will conveniently stop recording the family makeup of the abuse victim once it becomes clear that homosexuals perform abuse at greater rates than heterosexuals. You just need to close your eyes and remember homosexuals “love” just like heterosexuals.</p>
<p>Once heterosexuals such as yourself are persecuted and shamed for preferring vanilla sex, and children are converted to bisexuality or homosexuality with the aid of a gay and transsexual obsessed media, marriage will decline from its already pathetic rate, birth rates will plummet, and society itself will collapse… unless we find some third-world shithole where we can keep importing immigrants to further destabilize <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/cultural-collapse-theory">what remaining social fabric is left</a>. Along with feminism, abortion-on-demand, and birth control for all healthy women, gay marriage is a necessary step for destroying American society, and so the man who claims that “gay marriage doesn’t affect me” is like the child who doesn’t understand that eating ice cream every day is a bad idea that will put his future health in jeopardy. It is already affecting your freedom of speech and soon it will affect your sex life <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/03/us-mozilla-ceo-resignation-idUSBREA321Y320140403">and employment</a>.</p>
<p>The dust from gay marriage hasn’t even settled before the establishment has begun forcing transsexual acceptance down our throats with <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/2020/listing/2015-04/24-bruce-jenner-the-interview">ABC</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/espys/2015/story/_/id/13264599/caitlyn-jenner-accepts-arthur-ashe-courage-award-espys-ashe2015">ESPN</a>, and <a href="https://news.starbucks.com/news/transgender-partners-share-stories-of-unconditional-acceptance-at-starbucks">Starbucks</a> leading the charge. The media has also started <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/06/opinion/pedophilia-a-disorder-not-a-crime.html?_r=0">attempts to promote pedophilia</a> as a reasonable<a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/09/21/im_a_pedophile_but_not_a_monster/"> alternative lifestyle</a>. While I don’t even want to think of what comes next, I do know that if this degenerate march is not halted, we will see a complete inversion of American society where most masculine behaviors are made illegal and the traditional family becomes a relic of the past. Homosexual marriage will only embolden the degenerate forces that have power in America today. Unless they are stopped, I fear great catastrophe, not only for us men, but the country itself.</p>
