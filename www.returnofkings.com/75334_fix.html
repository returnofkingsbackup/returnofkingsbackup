<p>It’s easy to become a father. It’s hard to be a dad, to help your children grow strong and healthy while taking care of yourself. Being a good dad takes a tremendous amount of time and energy, and sometimes at the end of the day, you don’t have any time and energy left for you.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75346" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-lean-with-the-kids-2-300x213.jpg" alt="Keep it lean with the kids 2" width="508" height="361" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-lean-with-the-kids-2-300x213.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-lean-with-the-kids-2-1200x851.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-lean-with-the-kids-2-837x594.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-lean-with-the-kids-2-667x473.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-lean-with-the-kids-2-262x186.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-lean-with-the-kids-2-574x407.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px"></p>
<p>Great dads keep themselves strong and healthy. When it comes to getting and staying muscular and lean, there are plenty of ways to do it, while staying present for your kids.</p>
<h3>1. Keep It Lean With The Kids</h3>
<p>Get your kids away from the TV or their phones and go be active together. Find a few hours on a weekend to check out places like outdoor themed parks for zip-lining and hiking, or spend a few hours at public swimming pools or local parks.</p>
<p>Make plans to do something with other families. The accountability of plans made with other people will help you stick to getting out of the house on time.</p>
<h3>2. Keep Adventuring</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75347" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-adventuring-300x212.jpg" alt="Keep adventuring" width="500" height="353" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-adventuring-300x212.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-adventuring-1200x847.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-adventuring-837x591.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-adventuring-667x471.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-adventuring-262x185.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-adventuring-574x405.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>If you want a real adventure, download the free version of the <a href="http://www.geocaching.com">Geocaching</a> app to your phone and go for a treasure hunt! It’s really a treasure hunt, and you can do it anywhere in the world—there are even several geocaches on the continent of Antarctica. There are probably some within a mile of your house. The thrill of finding a geocache becomes addictive, and it may turn out to be the active new hobby your family needs.</p>
<h3>3. Keep It Colorful</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75350" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful-300x199.jpg" alt="Keep it colorful" width="500" height="332" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful-1200x797.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful-837x556.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful-667x443.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful-574x381.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-colorful.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Every parenting book tells you to make sure your children are getting a variety of whole foods, fruits, and vegetables, but what about you? When you think of meal planning: think color. And for Pete’s sake, eat breakfast! For a quick protein-rich breakfast, go with a microwave omelet or some scrambled eggs and add pre-chopped veggies like tomatoes, avocado, peppers or spinach.</p>
<h3>4. Keep Up With Your Macronutrients</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75351" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-up-with-macronutrients-300x245.jpg" alt="Food for thought" width="500" height="409" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-up-with-macronutrients-300x245.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-up-with-macronutrients-667x545.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-up-with-macronutrients-262x214.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-up-with-macronutrients-574x469.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-up-with-macronutrients.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Take some time and figure out the macronutrient ratios<sup>1</sup> that can help you balance your meals more easily. It’s a great way to lose weight, build muscle, and maintain your weight loss, especially if you’ve plateaued.</p>
<h3>5. Keep Drinking Water</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75352" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-drinking-water-300x198.jpg" alt="Keep drinking water" width="500" height="331" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-drinking-water-300x198.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-drinking-water-1200x794.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-drinking-water-837x554.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-drinking-water-667x441.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-drinking-water-262x173.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-drinking-water-574x380.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Soft drinks taste great, but they’re not doing you any favors. Stop drinking your calories, and you’ll find that you can meet your weight loss goals faster. You’re already encouraging your kids to drink water, so set a good example. Add fresh sliced cucumbers, strawberries, oranges, lemons or limes to water to add a little zing, which will also help fight food cravings.</p>
<h3>6. Keep Track of Your Alcohol</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75353" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-300x299.jpg" alt="Keep track of your alcohol" width="498" height="496" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-300x299.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-1200x1197.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-837x835.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-667x665.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-262x261.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-track-of-your-alcohol-574x572.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px"></p>
<p>Craft beer is delicious, and it contributes to the spare tire many Dad Bods sport. While beer has a lot of carbs, clear liquors don’t—but any added mixers contribute calories and sugar. Choose a lighter carb beer or glass of wine.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>If you’re an unwind with a cocktail kind of guy, resist the urge to mix with juices and try mixing flavored vodka and soda or sparkling water instead. And whatever you are planning to have, try to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/47806/preventing-hangovers-with-a-pre-drinking-drink">prevent hangovers</a> at any cost.</p>
<h3>7. Keep Eating Lean Protein</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75354" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-eating-lean-protein-300x200.jpg" alt="Sandwich with salmon" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-eating-lean-protein-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-eating-lean-protein-1200x800.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-eating-lean-protein-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-eating-lean-protein-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-eating-lean-protein-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-eating-lean-protein-574x383.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>When meal planning, opt for lean protein like chicken and turkey. Tuna, salmon, tilapia, cod, are all great lean protein options. Red meat is okay to include sometimes, if you choose the leaner cuts of meat and opt for grass-feed beef.</p>
<h3>8. Keep Getting The Family Involved</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75355" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved-300x200.jpg" alt="Keep getting the family involved" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved-1200x800.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved-574x383.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-getting-the-family-involved.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>This isn’t a one-man show. Surround yourself with little minions of health by encouraging family meal planning, and cooking together on nights when your schedules allow it. Or discover great recipes for healthy snacks, such as <a href="https://www.muscleandstrength.com/recipes/protein-bars">homemade protein bars</a>.</p>
<h3>9. Keep Making Healthy Choices</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75356" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-making-healthy-choices-300x200.jpg" alt="Keep making healthy choices" width="500" height="334" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-making-healthy-choices-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-making-healthy-choices-1200x802.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-making-healthy-choices-837x559.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-making-healthy-choices-667x446.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-making-healthy-choices-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-making-healthy-choices-574x383.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>“Abs are made in the gym, but revealed in the kitchen.”<sup>2</sup> To get and stay lean and muscular, it requires diligence to stay on track with healthy meal choices and carving out time for being active. Set alarms to remind you to stop what you’re doing and drink a full glass of water, to do 20 pushups or 50 jumping jacks.</p>
<p>Small increments always add up to a whole. Committing to an entire hour of working out in the morning is hard. Committing to 25 crunches is easy.</p>
<h3>10. Keep Feeling Supported</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75357" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-feeling-supported-300x200.jpg" alt="Keep feeling supported" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-feeling-supported-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-feeling-supported-1200x800.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-feeling-supported-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-feeling-supported-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-feeling-supported-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-feeling-supported-574x383.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>There’s no way you’ll stick to a plan for getting lean and muscular unless you know you have support and accountability. Find websites and forums for people you identify with and then feel free to share your ideas with like-minded users. You may discover a new potential and, source of motivation!</p>
<h3>11. Keep It Fast When You Don’t Have Time</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75358" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-fast-when-you-dont-have-time-300x225.jpg" alt="Keep it fast when you don't have time" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-fast-when-you-dont-have-time-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-fast-when-you-dont-have-time-1200x900.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-fast-when-you-dont-have-time-837x628.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-fast-when-you-dont-have-time-667x500.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-fast-when-you-dont-have-time-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Keep-it-fast-when-you-dont-have-time-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Some days, the plan is going to go out the window. If you can’t make it to a gym, try a fast, full-body, fat-burning workout. Turn your favourite workout music on and you can improvise by combining any kind of body-weight fitness moves you can think of.</p>
<p>How about a quick circuit of pushups, bicycle crunches, burpees, lunches, squats and high knee jumps? That’ll get your heart racing.</p>
<h3>12. Keep Away From Quick Fixes</h3>
<p>Your Dad Bod didn’t happen overnight, and the fix isn’t going to be found in a pill or a special supplement or in a bottle. Focus on taking each small step, and making it count. It’s just like when you helped your baby learn to walk. It’s just one foot in front of the other. Sometimes you fall down, but the important thing is you get back up again.</p>
<p>What’s one small step you can take right now?</p>
