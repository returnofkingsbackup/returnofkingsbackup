<p>Recently, the French political party, Front National, suffered a defeat, failing to win a single region in the second round of municipal voting. The defeat was a disappointment, as the party had done well in the first round of voting thanks to anti-immigration sentiment. However, one bright note is that the election saw the rise of an attractive new political star: Marion Maréchal-Le Pen.</p>
<h3>What is Front National?</h3>
<div id="attachment_75677" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-75677" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3837472-300x149.jpg" alt="3837472" width="500" height="248" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3837472-300x149.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3837472-262x130.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3837472-574x285.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/3837472.jpg 645w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of Front National, and his granddaughter Marion</p>
</div>
<p>Front National was founded in 1972 by Jean-Marie Le Pen to unite various French nationalist movements. Because the party’s anti-Semitic and anti-immigration stances, Front National had a bad reputation in the French media and Le Pen was dubbed the “Devil of the Republic.”</p>
<p>When she took over leadership of the party in 2011, Jean-Marie’s daughter Marine sought to remove the offensive elements of the party in an effort to make the party more palatable to the general public. This included softening the party’s xenophobic image and purging it of anti-Semitism. That meant that she purged her own father, the founder of the party.</p>
<p>Today, Front National is characterized by being anti-immigration, especially against Islamic immigration. The party opposes the European Union as infringing upon France’s sovereignty. It has also adopted a mildly protectionist stance.</p>
<h3>Marion Maréchal-Le Pen</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-75724" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CV-eyZcWsAE_Iui-300x300.jpg" alt="CV-eyZcWsAE_Iui" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CV-eyZcWsAE_Iui-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CV-eyZcWsAE_Iui-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CV-eyZcWsAE_Iui-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CV-eyZcWsAE_Iui-574x574.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/CV-eyZcWsAE_Iui.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>Marion, who is the granddaughter of the founder of Front National, became the youngest French MP in modern history when she was elected at age 22 back in 2012. In the most recent election, she won the first round by capturing 40% of the vote—the second highest percentage in France.</p>
<p>However, she lost in the second round because the Socialist party candidate dropped out and encouraged her supporters to vote for Nicholas Sarkozy’s “center right” Republican party candidate. In other words, the so-called leftwing party, and the so-called rightwing party, are so terrified of Front National that they are willing to work together to block it from coming into power. This makes me wonder how much tangible difference there is between the Socialists and Republicans in France—sort of like the Democrats and the Republicans in the US.</p>
<p>Despite her loss, Marion remains extremely popular. She is arguably more popular than her aunt Marine Le Pen, who is the head of the Front National party. Since she is only 26 years old, she will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in French politics.</p>
<p>But Marion’s appeal goes further. She’s become an inspirational figure for nationalist movements in other countries as well.</p>
<h3>The secret of Marion’s popularity</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75725 " title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-2-300x400.png" alt="photo-2" width="282" height="376" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-2-300x400.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-2-837x1117.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-2-667x890.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-2-262x350.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-2-574x766.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/photo-2.png 959w" sizes="(max-width: 282px) 100vw, 282px"></p>
<p>Of course, the fact that Marion is young and attractive is part of her appeal. But if her popularity was merely the result of looks, we could just run beauty queens for political office. The real secret of Marion’s appeal comes from the fact that she is bold and unapologetic about her beliefs.</p>
<p>In a country that is highly secular and atheistic, Marion is a devout Catholic. She is openly pro-life and against gay marriage even though we are regularly told that those positions are on the “wrong side of history.”</p>
<p>She is highly critical of Islam and how it relates to the French Republic. She has stated that Muslims could only be considered French if they adopt French “customs and a lifestyle” that have been shaped by 1500 years of Christianity, and if they speak French as their first language. She even opposes schools providing substitute meals to conform to Muslim’s halal rules.</p>
<p>In a recent speech, Marion sounded very much unlike American politicians who reduce American culture to nothing more than consumerism:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘We are not a land of Islam,’ she declared. ‘In our country, we don’t wear djellaba clothing, we don’t wear a veil and we don’t impose cathedral-sized mosques.’</p>

<h3>How Marion’s message applies to American politics</h3>
<div id="attachment_75718" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-75718" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/file_189411_0_cantina_header-300x169.jpg" alt="file_189411_0_cantina_header" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/file_189411_0_cantina_header-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/file_189411_0_cantina_header-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/file_189411_0_cantina_header-574x323.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/file_189411_0_cantina_header.jpg 658w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Mos Eisley Cantina or your local Starbucks</p>
</div>
<p>Democrats and the “cuckservative” GOP establishment are horrified by the bold language that Marion uses. Their vision of the United States is the Star Wars Mos Eisley Cantina—a hodgepodge of different peoples and cultures holding nothing in common except the compulsive drive to buy more stuff. American politicians are terrified of offending any group of potential voters so they make no demands upon anyone.</p>
<p>This wasn’t always the case. There was a time when being a US citizen resulted in real benefits, but it also entailed real responsibilities. President Theodore Roosevelt wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should insist that if the immigrant who comes here does in good faith become an American and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with every one else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birth-place or origin.</p>
<p>But this is predicated upon the man’s becoming in very fact an American and nothing but an American. If he tries to keep segregated with men of his own origin and separated from the rest of America, then he isn’t doing his part as an American. There can be no divided allegiance here. . . We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding-house; and we have room for but one soul loyalty, and that is loyalty to the American people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson that the popularity of people like Marion Le Pen and Donald Trump have for American politicians is that the voters are tired of being ignored. They want their governments to put citizens first and globalist and corporate concerns second.</p>
<h3>Time is running out for France</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-75691" title="" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-5.06.41-PM-300x73.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-12-15 at 5.06.41 PM" width="568" height="138" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-5.06.41-PM-300x73.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-5.06.41-PM-837x204.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-5.06.41-PM-667x162.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-5.06.41-PM-262x64.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-5.06.41-PM-574x140.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-15-at-5.06.41-PM.png 1192w" sizes="(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px"></p>
<p>While an appealing politician like Marion should give us hope, we should not delude ourselves into thinking that the future is inevitably bright. The window of opportunity for nationalist parties to win an election is becoming smaller every day due to demographic trends.</p>
<p>RVF poster Samseau <a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-52149-post-1169726.html#pid1169726">noted</a> that after this election, the left and “center-right” parties will likely increase Islamic immigration. Following French law, these immigrants will be eligible for French citizenship after five years. The probability that these new citizens would ever vote for a nationalist party is nil.</p>
<p>If Front National is not able to mount a victory in the 2017 presidential election, we may safely write off France as no longer being a distinctively Christian European country. It’s fate will be sealed. It will slowly but inevitably morph into another outpost of the Muslim Ummah.</p>
<p>It is no different in the United States. Although Donald Trump is not a nationalist in the same sense as Front National, he represents the last hope that the United States will see a government that desires to “promote the general welfare” of American citizens first.</p>
<p>If 2016 marks the election of Hillary or one of the globalist, donor-approved GOP candidates, immigration, both legal and illegal, will be increased. By the 2024 presidential election, the US will be reduced to a bunch of squabbling minorities, all vying against each other to grab the remaining government benefits.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Marion Maréchal-Le Pen represents a refreshing trend in politics: politicians who reject political correctness and who are unabashedly nationalistic. If these politicians are elected, they may be able to roll back the globalist policies that have made their citizens feel like foreigners in their own countries.</p>
<p>But the establishment forces are not going to give up easily. If they can collude to block the election of a beautiful, charismatic woman like Marion, they will do the same to any other politician who threatens to challenge their hegemony. If there was ever a time to register to vote and to be politically active, this would be it.</p>
