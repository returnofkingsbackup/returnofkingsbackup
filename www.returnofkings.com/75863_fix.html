<p>While women are affected by life experiences, and particularly <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/46543/women-should-save-their-virginity-for-marriage">number of sexual partners</a>, far more severely than men, there are always steps that can be taken to preserve and cultivate the dormant femininity that lies within every woman.</p>
<p>If you are working on a LTR with a woman, demand these behaviors. If you know females, encourage and reward this behavior in them. And if you are a lurking female, take these to heart.</p>
<h3>1. Stop cursing</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75871" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling-300x209.jpg" alt="yelling" width="507" height="353" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling-300x209.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling-837x583.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling-667x464.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling-262x182.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling-574x400.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/yelling.jpg 1103w" sizes="(max-width: 507px) 100vw, 507px"></a></p>
<p>If it really makes you feel all “equal and empowered” to talk like an ex-con, then go home and do it into your pillow. Men don’t want to hear a woman curse. It’s <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/72542/two-feminist-sluts-indoctrinate-america">not feminine</a>. It’s rude. It’s trashy. Men want to hear a pleasant, calming, soothing voice, and to look at a smiling, kind woman.</p>
<p>Besides, if you really want to be all individual and cool, try standing out from the crowd by smiling and using gentle language. I guarantee you’ll stand out, and in a good way.</p>
<h3>2. Hit the gym</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gym.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75872 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gym.jpg" alt="gym" width="615" height="459" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gym.jpg 615w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gym-300x224.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gym-262x196.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gym-574x428.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px"></a></p>
<p>A woman’s physical appearance is more than half of her attractiveness. And over 90% at the beginning of a relationship. While a woman can’t do much about her face, height, or skin, losing weight will make a woman more attractive in almost every single case.</p>
<h3>3. Quit eating out and hit the cookbooks</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/healthy_happy_kitchen.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75873 " src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/healthy_happy_kitchen.jpg" alt="healthy_happy_kitchen" width="502" height="334" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/healthy_happy_kitchen.jpg 434w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/healthy_happy_kitchen-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/healthy_happy_kitchen-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px"></a></p>
<p>Processed food is unhealthy, and often expensive. The quality of the ingredients used in all but the top restaurants is quite poor. The meats are laden with chemicals, hormones, and even <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14410160/ns/health-infectious_diseases/t/fda-oks-bacteria-eating-virus-treat-meat/">sprayed with viruses</a>, and the produce coated in pesticides. Fat-free food, the latest craze, is unhealthy, and loaded with sugars and other fillers to counteract the poor taste that results when natural fats are removed.</p>
<p>Eliminating eating out will benefit a woman by reducing her waistline as well as her financial expenditures. And of course, what better way to express your love and admiration for the important man in your life than to cook him a healthy, delicious meal from scratch? The old adages are rarely wrong, and indeed it is true that “the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach.”</p>
<h3>4. Learn a hobby</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75877" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa-300x382.jpg" alt="beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa" width="490" height="624" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa-300x382.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa-667x850.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa-262x334.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa-574x732.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/beautiful-girl-playing-piano-sefedin-stafa.jpg 706w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"></a></p>
<p>In more traditional times, women were expected to take up a hobby or develop a talent, the same way pageant participants do today. An idle mind is the devil’s playground, and instead of filling their head with garbage like the latest anti-male movie on the Lifetime network or glorifying talentless sluts like the Kardashians through pop culture media, a woman can bring happiness and joy to those in her life by learning a skill such as singing, dancing, playing an instrument, or any artistic endeavor.</p>
<p>Bonus points if you are young, as such skills are rarely seen in girls in their 20s.</p>

<h3>5. Grow your hair</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-73076" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL-300x225.jpg" alt="NICE GIRL" width="452" height="339" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL-1200x900.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL-837x628.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL-667x500.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL-574x431.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NICE-GIRL.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 452px) 100vw, 452px"></p>
<p>The other day a woman complained to me about how cutting her hair costs about five times what my local barber charges. There’s a simple solution: grow your hair longer. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/27706/10-tragic-examples-of-pretty-girls-ruining-themselves-with-bad-hair">Long hair is feminine</a>, attractive, and the opposite of men, which is the whole reason we are attracted to you in the first place.</p>
<p>We don’t want to date a muscular, cursing, bald person with tits who looks like Hulk Hogan. We want a woman to contrast and complement us, to be the yin to our yang. Long hair is almost always more attractive than short hair on a woman. Whatever you do, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/26763/girls-with-short-hair-are-damaged">do not cut your hair shorter than a man</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Smile</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75880" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman-300x225.jpg" alt="angry-woman" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman-837x627.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman-667x500.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman-262x196.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman-574x430.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/angry-woman.jpg 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>
<p>It may sound trite and silly, but guys in the West rarely have a woman smile at them, other than (hopefully) their girlfriend or wife. Even then, make a point to smile more often, and it will only help.</p>
<p>I can’t remember the last time a Western girl smiled at me spontaneously, without me having to tell her a joke or “make” her smile. A woman who flashes a friendly smile at guys will set herself far apart from her competition.</p>
<h3>7. Think before speaking</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75883 " src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me.jpg" alt="me" width="495" height="371" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me.jpg 625w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-262x196.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/me-574x430.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"></a></p>
<p>Last night I was out with a couple of girls socially. One is a former FWB, the other just a friend. They were to be my social proof for meeting other women. While talking to them, I realized why the “friend” had never been anything more. She wouldn’t shut up about herself, and her ridiculous life.</p>
<p>She went on and on about her job, her social events this week, the number of dates she was having, how she makes poor decisions about men and it never works out. In my head, I was thinking “of course, no reasonable guy will go out with you, when you just admitted you are dating (i.e. banging) five guys this week.”</p>
<p>But more than that, it was just incredibly boring. Think about why the other party would have any interest in what you are about to tell them before opening your mouth.</p>
<h3>8. Dress like a girl</h3>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-75886" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem-300x331.jpg" alt="fem" width="500" height="551" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem-300x331.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem-837x923.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem-667x735.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem-262x289.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem-574x633.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/fem.jpg 964w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></a></p>
<p>Guys are visually attracted to women, and first impressions make a big difference. Nothing says “feminine, nurturing, sexy, available woman” like a girl who dresses like one. Dresses, skirts, heels, clothing that accentuate your body = good. Anything that a guy can wear = bad.</p>
<h3>Reinforce Traditional Femininity</h3>
<p>Part of neomasculinity is that we encourage, support, and reinforce traditional feminine values and virtues. Any time you see a girl displaying these behaviors, compliment and encourage her. Make remarks to girls you meet encouraging these behaviors. Respond to any bad traits with <em><strong>“That’s not very feminine.” </strong> </em>Show women that despite what MTV and Cosmo tell her, her grandmother is actually a positive role model.</p>
