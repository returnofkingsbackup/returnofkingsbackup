<p>Having worked in state government for three years, I am a political junkie. I have become addicted to talk radio, podcasts, and follow the news constantly. With that said, I didn’t vote in the 2012 Presidential Election or in my 2014 State Governor Election because I was so disenfranchised with the candidates, the corrupt state of our so-called “Government,” and the political parties. So, it was a pleasant surprise that while browsing the news channels this summer I stumbled unto Donald J. Trump’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_q61B-DyPk" target="_blank">Presidential Announcement Speech </a>and was blown away by his sheer balls and charisma.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don’t do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably bid deals. That’s how I get my kicks.</p>
<p>Most people are surprised by the way I work. I play it very loose. I don’t carry a briefcase. I try not to schedule too many meetings. I leave my door open. You can’t be imaginative or entrepreneurial if you’ve got too much structure. I prefer to come to work each day and just see what develops.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Watching his rise in the polls and the negative Mainstream Media spin, I became curious of the man and wanted to see if I could get a peek into his character, from his very own words. Donald Trump famously said that the single greatest book every written (besides the Bible) was his own <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0345479173/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452897690&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Art+of+the+deal&amp;tag=rok0f-20">The Art of the Deal</a></em> and that everyone should read it. I figured, why the hell not?</p>
<h3>Background of the Trump Family</h3>
<div id="attachment_75945" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-75945" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family-300x169.jpg" alt="Donald Trump Poses with Family" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family-768x432.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family-574x323.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Donald-Trump-Poses-with-Family.jpg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Fun fact: Trump’s Grandfather Friedrich Drumpf, a German Immigrant, started a couple of ‘decadent’ restaurants (aka brothels) during the Gold Rush Era on the West Coast</p>
</div>
<p>Donald Trump was born in 1946 to Fred and Mary Trump in Queens, New York City. Donald’s father Fred had an interest in construction and at the ripe age of sixteen he started building garages for people in his neighborhood. In his early 20’s he decided to go full time into real estate construction and development, founding “Elizabeth Trump &amp; Son Co.” which later was renamed to Trump Organization LLC.</p>
<p>Donald was a pretty rebellious kid growing up, so his father Fred decided to send him to the New York Military Academy where he graduated from as a “captain of the cadets.” He later applied to the Wharton School of Finance at the University of Pennsylvania,  where he ended up graduating with a Bachelors of Science Degree in Economics. He immediately became involved with his father’s realty business and after several successful deals with his father, he decided to move to Manhattan and make his millions.</p>
<p>He was clearly successful but what<strong> character traits lead to his success</strong>? Surprisingly, his book reads like a game manual, which many similar concepts used to make the deals.</p>
<blockquote><p>When I look back at the deals I’ve made—and the ones I’ve lost or let pass—I see certain common elements. But unlike the real estate evangelists you see all over television these days, I can’t promise you that by following the precepts I’m about to offer you’ll become a millionaire overnight. Unfortunately, life rarely works that way, and most people who try to get rich quick end up going broke instead.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Think Big</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-34369" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bigstockphoto_base_jumping_in_shanghai_13716122.jpg" alt="bigstockphoto_base_jumping_in_shanghai_13716122" width="515" height="341"></p>
<blockquote><p>To me it’s very simple: if you’re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big. Most people think small because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning. And that gives people like me a great advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>How often, have you passed on a job opportunity because you where afraid of the unknowns?</p>
<p>How often, have you passed on talking to the 9/10 hottie at the bar and settled for the 7/10 because you were damn right intimidated by the perfectly sculpted body?</p>
<p>You may respond, “those two little words, ‘Think Big’ are easy to say and much different to put into action” and I would agree with you. However, the more you practice and the more you put explicit effort into raising your standards in all aspects of your life—the easier and more natural it will come to you.</p>
<h3>Protect The Downside And The Upside Will Take Care Of Itself</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-48354" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/11/meltdown-featured-image.jpg" alt="meltdown featured image" width="500" height="252"></p>
<blockquote><p>It’s been said that I believe in the power of positive thinking. In fact, I believe in the power of negative thinking. If you plan for the worst—if you can live with the worst—the good will always take care of itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>In terms of game, what are the worst things that can happen? She will reject you. In terms of relationships what is the worst thing that happen? You decide to get married and she divorces you.</p>
<p>Roosh wrote about the “<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-elephant-in-the-room" target="_blank">Elephant in the Room” </a>and the article struck a chord with me. If you decide to settle down, you must wrestle with the <a href="https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/the-hazards-of-long-term-relationships/" target="_blank">hazards of a long term relationship</a> and know what to do in <a href="http://manfortheages.com/biggest-divorce-mistakes-men-make/" target="_blank">case of a divorce.</a></p>
<h3>Know Your Market</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-59267" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue-300x200.jpg" alt="Stock-Market-Screen-blue" width="417" height="278" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue-1200x800.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue-667x444.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue-574x382.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Stock-Market-Screen-blue.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px"></p>
<blockquote><p>Some people have a sense of the market and some people don’t. I like to think I have that instinct. That’s why I don’t hire a lot of number-crunchers, and I don’t trust fancy marketing surveys…The other people I don’t take too seriously are the critics—except when they stand in the way of my projects. What very few of them have is any feeling for what the public wants. Which is why, if these critics ever tried to become developers, they’d be terrible failures.</p></blockquote>
<p>This why websites like these are so invaluable for waking up men and feeding them the red pill. From our birth, men have been lied to about the real “dating market” and we’ve been stumbling around trying to buy goods that are essentially <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/48312/the-deregulation-of-the-sexual-marketplace" target="_blank">damaged and ‘deregulated’</a>.</p>

<h3>Enhance Your Location</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most misunderstood concept in all of real estate is that the key to success is location, location, location. Usually, that’s said by people who don’t know what they’re talking about. First of all, you don’t necessarily need the best location. What you need is the best deal. Just as you can create leverage, you can enhance a location, through promotion and through psychology.</p>
<p>My point is that real money isn’t made in real estate by spending the top dollar to buy the best location. You can get killed doing that, just as you can get killed buying a bad location, even for a low price. What you should never do is pay too much, even if that means walking away from a very good site. Which is all a more sophisticated way of looking at location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On chat rooms and Facebook, you constantly hear complaints from men who just can’t understand why they wine and dine their women for months at high end restaurants and still can’t get laid. They shell out hundreds of dollars for meals, dates, etc…and get absolutely no return on investment.</p>
<p>Learn to maximize the best ways you can excite a woman (and land her at your bedside manor) by introducing her to different events, venues, and restaurants while minimizing your expense—but also know that if you have the best girl and she likes you, it doesn’t matter where you take her on a date.</p>
<h3>Get The Word Out</h3>

<blockquote><p>One thing I’ve learned about the press is that they’re always hungry for a good story, and the more sensational the better. It’s in the nature of the job, and I understand that. The point is that if you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things that are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you. I’ve always done things a little differently, I don’t mind controversy, and my deals tend to be somewhat ambitious.</p></blockquote>
<p>There’s a reason why the “jerkboy” mentality scores with the ladies, they love a man who is different from the mold.</p>
<blockquote><p>The other thing I do when I talk with reporters is to be straight. I try not to deceive them or to be defensive, because those are precisely the ways most people get themselves into trouble with the press. Instead, when a reporter asks me a tough question, I try to frame a positive answer, even if that means shifting the ground.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people’s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts. People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It’s an innocent form of exaggeration—and a very effective form of promotion.</p></blockquote>
<p>One cannot have bravado if one isn’t confident in himself, Andrian Red wrote a great article on <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/67964/5-proven-ways-to-become-more-assertive" target="_blank">“5 Proven Ways to Become More Assertive.”</a></p>
<h3>Fight Back</h3>
<blockquote><p>Much as it pays to emphasize the positive, there are times when the only choice is confrontation….One of the problems when you become successful is that jealousy and envy inevitably follow. There are people—I categorize them as life’s losers—who get their sense of accomplishment and achievement from trying to stop others.</p></blockquote>
<p>A man’s character and reputation is gained by what he does, and it can just as easily be slandered if you don’t stand up for yourself and fight back.</p>
<h3>Deliver The Goods</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-64285" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/playboy-featured-damaged-goods-300x239.jpg" alt="playboy featured damaged goods" width="438" height="349" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/05/playboy-featured-damaged-goods-300x239.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/playboy-featured-damaged-goods-262x209.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/05/playboy-featured-damaged-goods.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 438px) 100vw, 438px"></p>
<blockquote><p>You can’t con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole. But if you don’t deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of life’s little ironies are people who claim that they are an “expert” at something and then when it comes time for them to deliver, they fail monumentally. The reason is because a majority of people are frauds who hide behind a layer of ego.</p>
<h3>Have Fun</h3>
<blockquote><p>I don’t kid myself. Life is very fragile, and success doesn’t change that. If anything, success makes it more fragile. Anything can change, without warning, and that’s why I try not to take any of what’s happened too seriously. Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game. I don’t spend a lot of time worrying about what I should have done differently, or what’s going to happen next.</p></blockquote>
<p>Men are for the most part logical and calculating—when we learn something new, we put that knowledge into action very seriously—almost robotically—and forget to have fun. What’s the point of living, if we don’t have fun and enjoy ourselves once in awhile?</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trump-Art-Deal-Donald-J/dp/0345479173/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452897690&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Art+of+the+deal&amp;tag=rok0f-20">The Art of the Deal</a> </em>was a fun book to read and very educational. As the political season heats up in 2016 Donald Trump may very well end up becoming the Republican nominee. If he does, he did so because he understands game.</p>
