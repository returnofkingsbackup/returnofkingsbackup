<p style="text-align: left;">In 1969 my Dad and Mom loaded my little brother and me into the family station wagon and we took a drive to Boulder, Colorado. Our goal was to drive slowly through the University of Colorado campus. It was our cheap alternative to taking the family to Yellowstone Park to look at the bears. But instead of looking at bears begging for food, we looked at hippies sitting on the campus lawn smoking dope.</p>
<p>At that age I was part of a fundamentalist Christian family. We believed in Jesus, Israel, demons and The Rapture. The world was a scary place full of evil, demonic activity and sins. And some of the greatest sins of that time were rock music and boys with long hair. These long haired, dope smoking freaks were called “hippies.” They were the degenerate counter culture (freaks) that fought against The Establishment (squares).</p>
<p>These hippies opposed the war in Vietnam—the peace symbol was their emblem. They were young and didn’t trust anyone over 30. And their politics was a mishmash of anarchism and Marxism. But, above all, it was about smoking dope and fucking. Sex, drugs and rock &amp; roll baby!</p>
<p>I had a flashback of the hippie era as I read <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/how-2015-fueled-the-rise-of-the-freewheeling-white-nationali">a recent BuzzFeed news article</a> lamenting that the Alt Right is a bunch of degenerate young kids who are the counter culture. As such, I have come full circle. From the “square” kid laughing at the counter culture to now being seen as a leading figure of this movement. Jack Kerouac has become RAMZPAUL.</p>
<h3>How to define an informal movement?</h3>
<div id="attachment_76455" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-76455" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hippie-60s-09-300x249.gif" alt="hippie 60s 09" width="500" height="416" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hippie-60s-09-300x249.gif 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hippie-60s-09-667x554.gif 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hippie-60s-09-262x218.gif 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/hippie-60s-09-574x477.gif 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Hippie Chick (8/10, WB).</p>
</div>
<p>Part of the problem of defining an informal movement is that such an entity lacks precise boundaries. I think most of us have a mental image that comes to mind when we think of “hippie.” I think of some dude with long hair, wearing a tie dye T-shirt with a peace sign in one hand and a marijuana joint in the other. But does that description DEFINE a hippie? Could a man have short hair and be a hippie? Could a Republican be a hippie?</p>
<p>The same debate rages as to who is the “real” Alt Right. Can Christians be Alt Right? Can homosexuals? Jews? Bronies?</p>
<p>Like the hippie movement, it is impossible to make rigid definitions. However, the concept of Alt Right is useful in that it describes a certain political sub culture that is outside of the mainstream. To this end it can be useful to compare and contrast the Alt Right to more old school political movements.</p>
<h3>Traditional Republicans</h3>
<p>Traditional Republicans tend to see the world as a battle between “Conservatives” vs. “Liberals.” The Alt Right sees the battle in terms of “Nationalism” vs. “Globalism.”</p>
<p>Your typical “conservative” Republican believes in:</p>
<ul>
<li>low taxes</li>
<li>smaller government (in theory)</li>
<li>a strong military to defend Israel</li>
<li>guns</li>
<li>opposition to abortion</li>
</ul>
<p>These conservatives believe that Jesus loves all the little children of the world. And, as such, we are really all the same. We can import a million Somalis and if we just lower their taxes and “get the government off their backs” they will make great Republicans.</p>
<p>Typically these folks are also “pro-morality,” which, in practice, means that their moral compass is whatever the Democrats supported 20 years ago. As such, they tend to oppose gay marriage (for now) and believe race is “only skin color.”  But these moral positions always move to the left as the Republicans “grow” in office. I am sure that the Republicans will soon defend the sanctity of gay marriage as a “conservative value” and claim that race is real and we must fight “white privilege.”</p>
<p>As the Traditional Republicans tend to be older, internet memes and jokes tend to confuse them. Basically the only meme they understand is that of the “kick ass” middle aged woman with big tits holding a rifle. (Women with guns is a fetish for these types.)</p>

<h3>The Alt Right Is About Identity</h3>
<p>People on the Alt Right are primarily concerned with <em>identity</em>. This means:</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<ul>
<li>Hungary belongs to the Hungarians</li>
<li>Germany belongs to the Germans</li>
<li>France belongs to the French</li>
</ul>
<p>Syrians that flood into Germany may become citizens but they will never be Germans. For a nation is based on a common blood, language and culture. Years ago this was known as self-determination and common sense. Now it is known as “WHITE SUPREMACY” by the left and establishment Republicans.</p>
<p>However, curiously, the one exception is Israel. Both the Democrats and the Republicans affirm the Israel has the right to remain a Jewish ethno-state.  As such, no Democrat or Republican politician is demanding that Israel accept Syrian refugees. But these same politicians insist that white countries have a moral obligation to accept endless refugees.</p>
<p>It has been something of a pastime for the globalists to excitedly predict when a country will no longer have a white majority. Germany will no longer have a white majority by 2020! The USA will no longer be White by 2030! The destruction of the white majority is always seen as inevitable and a good thing. And to oppose it means you are a “White Supremacist” or a “Nazi.”</p>
<p>But some people no longer want to be dispossessed from their homelands. And, yet, they also don’t want to exploit or harm other races. They just want self-determination for their people as the Jews have self-determination in Israel. These are the ideologically refugees that have migrated to the Alt Right.</p>
<h3>14/88, SIEG HEIL, KKK, Neo-Nazis, Racial Holy War, etc.</h3>
<div id="attachment_76457" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-76457" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/white-girl-wheat-09.jpg" alt="white girl wheat 09" width="500" height="282"><p class="wp-caption-text">(Disclaimer – I do not advocate white girls damaging our precious wheat)</p>
</div>
<p>“NO ENEMIES TO THE RIGHT!” is the cry I frequently hear when I criticize the Hollywood Nazi styled groups. Of course, that assumes that such people are sincere. Hal Turner, a famous radical on the Right, was an admitted FBI informer. Brian Holland was the Presidential Candidate of the NSM (Neo-Nazi) Party. He later also admitted to being a government informer. Are such informers really to the right?</p>
<p>The above are just two examples of the long history of ADL and SPLC shills and government informers in such groups.  As President Obama has declared the “Radical Right” to be the REAL terrorist threat, you can bet many people are paid to play the neo-Nazi role both on-line and in real life.</p>
<p>I have personally received more threats from the “neo-Nazi” crowd than from anyone on the left. After doing some investigation I discovered that many of these characters previously had zero interest in politics or were actually “anti-racist.”  But prison time (and the promise of an early release) can “flip” such people to play a desired role with the associated funding.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the ADL and SPLC in using such shills is to associate any sort of white identity with “Nazism” and “White Supremacism.” Guilt by association might be a logical fallacy, but it is effective in transforming public opinion and obfuscating the real goals of a movement.</p>
<p>Of course, I often hear the argument that the Democrats and Republicans will call the Alt Right “Nazis” anyway so we might as well embrace the Heil Hitler crowd. But that is a mistake. We must define our own values and live in our own times. Despite the desire of the ADL and SPLC, the world is not perpetually circa 1933 Germany.</p>

<h3>The future</h3>
<p>The Hippies of the 1950s and 1960s were never a formal political movement. But the basic philosophy gave birth to organizations and influenced public policy. Hillary Clinton is basically a relic of the hippie generation. And they are now the establishment.</p>
<p>We on the Alt Right are the hippies of our time. We are the counter culture. And while we are not a formal organization we do have organizations such as American Renaissance (AmRen) and National Policy Institute (NPI) that represent many of our values. The primary of these values being self-determination for all people.</p>
<p>We are also starting to see mainstream pundits such as Ann Coulter and mainstream politicians such as Donald Trump tap into many Alt Right themes. As we continue to grow, we will see more famous people reject the globalism of the Democrats and Republicans and embrace nationalism.</p>
<p>The wheel will turn and we will one day regain the institutions and be the establishment. But for now, enjoy the creative freedom and fun of being part of the counter culture.</p>
<p>Peace and Love.</p>
