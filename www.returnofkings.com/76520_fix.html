<p>Recently, Roosh shared with me <a href="http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/03/the-rivkin-project-part-1/">an article in three parts</a> on a conference that took place in Paris in 2010, initiated by the US ambasador to France, Charles Rivkin and aimed at many influencal figures of the state. The goal of this confidential conference was to deconstruct the French identity and sovereignty through different actions.</p>
<p>The document was released on Wikileaks and can be found <a href="https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/10PARIS58_a.html">here</a>. It is a written proof of the will of the American government and investors to interfere in the domestic affairs of our sovereign state, something that we see in our daily lives. Here are the fields on which the multicuturalist and globalist decisions maker focus:</p>
<h3>1. School</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76588" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/800px-France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg.638x0_q80_crop-sma-300x187.jpg" alt="800px-France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg.638x0_q80_crop-sma" width="501" height="312" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/800px-France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg.638x0_q80_crop-sma-300x187.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/800px-France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg.638x0_q80_crop-sma-262x163.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/800px-France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg.638x0_q80_crop-sma-574x358.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/800px-France_in_XXI_Century._School.jpg.638x0_q80_crop-sma.jpg 638w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"></p>
<p>Being a former teacher, I noticed the introduction of constant changes since my youth and the education I received. An even stronger cultural masochism is taught to our kids at school. Racist and racism are the almighty go-to words that instantly discredit the hour-long argumentation of anyone, even when backed with research and scientific proof.</p>
<p>Educational lobbies are changing the school programs to teach the glory of African kingdoms and the expansion of Islam, instead of French history and civilization. Leftists call anyone who wants to focus on native history and its figures a “neo-colonialist.” As French polemicist Eric Zemmour puts it, destroying “the French National epic” and its heroes is the goal. The Rivkin program also includes redefining French history in the school curricula to give attention to the role of non-French minorities in French history.</p>
<div id="attachment_76614" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-76614" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-300x200.jpg" alt="Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, Education Minister" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-768x512.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-1200x800.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Najat-Vallaud-Belkacem-ministre-de-l-Education-nationale-574x383.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, Education Minister</p>
</div>
<p>The decision of teaching more about Arab kingdoms than French kings belongs to the current Minister of education, formerly Minister of Women’s rights, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, a short-haired Arab woman born in Morocco who became French because her dad worked in France. She is fighting against sexism and inequality, is pro-abortion and stumps for the rights of the gay and transsexual lobby. I am obviously expecting an unbiased decision.</p>
<p>Rivkin states in the report of the conference, that the 1,000 American English language teachers employed at French schools will be provided with the propaganda materials necessary to inculcate the desired ideals into their French pupils.</p>
<h3>2. Kids shows</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76566" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tv_new_yo_gabba_gabba-300x196.jpg" alt="tv_new_yo_gabba_gabba" width="497" height="325" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tv_new_yo_gabba_gabba-300x196.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tv_new_yo_gabba_gabba-262x171.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tv_new_yo_gabba_gabba.jpg 460w" sizes="(max-width: 497px) 100vw, 497px"></p>
<p>The earlier the better. Back when I was a child, the cartoons I watched depicted mighty heroes crushing the enemy, often bloodily. There was a conflict between good and evil and a lesson taught. The story had a beginning, a chain of events, and an end. Now every episode has too many characters (all diversity-approved) who are often weak, but that’s ok because everyone is nice and worrying about the unknown is intolerant. The creators teach children that being a weakling is not a problem and that working on your looks is not important because true beauty is in the heart.</p>
<p>As the son of an ambassador, Rivkin had no experience in foreign policy and diplomacy. He was appointed because he had experience in including multiculturalist propaganda in kids’ shows and being the CEO of the Wildbrain company, which created Yo Gabba Gabba! among other things. Watch an extract of the show if you don’t know it, you will understand what I mean.</p>
<h3>3. Language</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76583" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/People-talking-300x157.jpg" alt="People-talking" width="501" height="262" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/People-talking-300x157.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/People-talking-262x137.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/People-talking-574x300.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/People-talking.jpg 665w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"></p>
<p>People in France will be fooled into thinking that by promoting multiculturalism, they carry the French ideals of the Revolution and the Enlightenment brought by the French spirit of democracy. They would be insulting the memory of the Siècle des Lumières and the reputation of the “land of the human rights” by refusing more migrants or not adapting to all the tantrums thrown by the minorities on French soil.</p>
<p>The pledge for equality starts with our language. America brought us the political correctness. It is not politically correct to call a black man “noir” which is the name of the black color in french. Now it is better to say “un black,” since the English term apparently makes it ok. We cannot call a homosexual man “homosexuel,” so now we have to use “gay.”</p>
<p>And the list goes on. WTF, lol, parking, shopping, wifi, buzz, tweet, swag, like etc. now invades the language of our children and adults, already under the attack of ghetto slang. I have a deep love for English and pride myself in the knowledge I have of it, but like Sebastien Chabal, proud Gaul, said:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76565" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/chabal-300x177.jpg" alt="chabal" width="499" height="293" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/chabal-300x177.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/chabal-262x154.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/chabal.jpg 440w" sizes="(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px"></p>
<h3>4. Food</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76577" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eating-junk-food-makes-a-bad-mood-worse-Study_strict_xxl-300x169.jpg" alt="Eating-junk-food-makes-a-bad-mood-worse-Study_strict_xxl" width="501" height="282" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eating-junk-food-makes-a-bad-mood-worse-Study_strict_xxl-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eating-junk-food-makes-a-bad-mood-worse-Study_strict_xxl-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eating-junk-food-makes-a-bad-mood-worse-Study_strict_xxl-574x323.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Eating-junk-food-makes-a-bad-mood-worse-Study_strict_xxl.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px"></p>
<p>The phenomenon of “malbouffe” (junk food) is smearing our rich culinary culture and became an essential part of our young people’s social life and diet. Coca Cola, McDonald’s, and other giants advertise everywhere and fast food “restaurants” just pop out of nowhere, even in the remote countryside. So does liquid sugar merchant Starbucks and its open <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/why-heterosexual-men-should-boycott-starbucks">support to homosexuals</a>.</p>
<p>Our national agrarian system is now invaded by pesticides and automated agriculture. The opponents of it are quickly silenced. With the GMOed Frankenstein turnips and corn created in American labs, the plants mutate and the people will soon pay the price.</p>
<p>Small local producers disappear and the large companies put what they want in the food. We are still slightly protected by our national laws on food quality and protected labels. But for how long?</p>
<h3>5. Influence on native youth</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76596" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/selfie-300x200.jpg" alt="selfie" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/selfie-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/selfie-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/selfie.jpg 562w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The Hipster-loving, tattoo-sporting, slut-celebrating culture as reached them and they love it. It makes them feel so special. So did lesbian and pansexual attention whoring of the girls, taught by pornography and the Hollywood crowd.</p>
<p>Promiscuity is on the rise, thanks to apps such as Tinder, the fashion of selfies, likes, attention-whoring, nudes sent on smartphones, Sex In The City, Instagram and the promotion of the hook-up culture, even if the young girls become more feminists. It goes only one way: against men.</p>
<p>The destruction of the nuclear family model and healthy relationships between men and women is the objective. The global culture turns our girls into unfuckable modern art masterpieces and our lads into fragile chicken-legged boys in skinny jeans and snapbacks for the urban predator to rob and attack.</p>
<h3>6. Hollywood culture</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76579" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit-300x168.jpg" alt="kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit" width="498" height="279" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit-300x168.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit-768x431.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit-837x470.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit-667x374.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit-574x322.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/kardashian-family-kris-jenner-support-bruce-jenner-transit.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px"></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>The Hollywood sphere keeps unloading its filth in France. Open homosexuality, metrosexuality, narcotic abuse, along with Pitt-Jolie and their adopted African kids, brought around like a new handbag are everywhere in our tabloids. Everything they do is cool—changing religion like you change underwear, becoming a woman because you are bored, mudsharking, being gay as a three pound note. The words they say are followed by the mass like the bloody Gospel.</p>
<h3>7. Destruction of nationalism</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76585" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sos-racisme1-300x174.jpg" alt="sos-racisme1" width="502" height="291" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sos-racisme1-300x174.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sos-racisme1-262x152.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sos-racisme1-574x333.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/sos-racisme1.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px"></p>
<p>The civil rights and feminist movements that trampled the ideas of freedom of association and patriarchy inspired the plague that are the anti-whites of SOS Racisme (oh, the irony) and the anti-heterosexual male feminists of Ni putes, Ni soumises (“Neither Whore nor Submissive”).</p>
<p>Regionalists and nationalist movements and their sympathizers are filed by the police and intelligence services like they supposedly do with the potential jihadis.</p>
<p>Observe <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/327213-corsica-anti-muslim-protest-ban/">what happened in Corsica lately</a>. The police services are moving heaven and earth to find the handful of men that broke into the Mosque and smashed the kebab place, but leave the youths that attacked the two firemen and the police officer that sparked the gatherings of the patriots in the first place. When a handful of Corsicans show more patriotic balls than millions of hand-holding JE SUIS CHARLIEs, there is an issue.</p>
<p>The objective detailed in Rivkin’s report is to monitor and counter any party that does not satisfy their agenda, namely nationalists and traditionalists, dubbing them “racist” and “xenophobic.” The words verbatim: “focusing on the decrease in popular support for xenophobic political parties and platforms.” This is to ensure that the program is working as it should to block the success of any “extreme” or “xenophobic” party that might challenge globalization.</p>
<h3>8. Consumption</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76576" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_-300x232.png" alt="Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_" width="500" height="387" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_-300x232.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_-768x594.png 768w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_-837x647.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_-667x516.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_-262x203.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_-574x444.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Consumerism-Guerrillamarketer.com_.png 1119w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The consumerism brilliantly orchestrated since the end of World War II started with GIs distributing cigarettes and chocolate to French children after four years of rationing during the Occupation, and continues with the giant American corporations pushing us to purchase things we don’t need. Inside every French, there is an American trying to get out.</p>
<p>The explosion of advertising budgets of the likes of Pepsi, Kellogg’s, or McDonald’s shows it. Some courageous peasants lead by Jose Bové, seeing the threat, tried to take McDonald’s influence apart physically, by crushing one of their joints with their tractors. They failed, as they had limited means compared to the gigantic reserves of cash the corporation had.</p>
<p>Before, the French were champions of recycling and inventiveness. Now they throw away without repairing. There is an obsession with novelty and the newest gadgets. This also helps them collect your data and know your taste so they can propose more things to buy. “Oh you bought X Item, you will also like Y and Z item! Buy, buy, buy!”</p>
<h3>9. Influence on non-native youth</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76584" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Racailles-300x222.jpg" alt="Racailles" width="500" height="370" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Racailles-300x222.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Racailles-262x194.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Racailles.jpg 360w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The Quick burger chain in France now wants to have the cool halal image and will only serve halal meat in a few years. McDonalds France already serves halal meat but does not advertise it and admits serving it without explicitly warning their clients. So do KFC France and Flunch.</p>
<p>The halal market is a gigantic and lucrative one, as the client that buys it pays a tax directly to the mosques and their private funds on the pretext that they are the authorities that validate every kilogram of halal meat produced. Some large chains of supermarkets focus more and more on their halal clientele. In addition to the sanitary risks of halal slaughtering, the problem is that the natives have to adapt to the non-natives’ diet in the name of equality.</p>
<p>There is also a strong phenomenon of “thugization” of the black and Arab youths in the housing estates of the big cities. All of that thanks to the rap and gang culture, brought by American television shows and the gangsta clips on MTV.</p>

</div>
<h3>10. Communication tools</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-76571" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/38904_L_iphone-300x200.jpg" alt="38904_L_iphone" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/12/38904_L_iphone-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/38904_L_iphone-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/12/38904_L_iphone.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The tablets and smart phones reach us younger and younger each year. Every schoolkid that can barely read already has a smartphone, an open door to porn, and the rest. Every family has one, and they replaced the baby-sitters.</p>
<p>Your position is always known thanks to your phone and they will listen to what you say if they want to. They know how many of you are in the house, what is your daily routine, what you buy, and what you read. The algorithms and data are kept.</p>
<p>The policy of “état d’urgence,” initiated following the Paris attacks, allows the government to bypass all the laws about digital privacy on the internet and is directly inspired by the Patriot Act that followed 9/11.</p>
<p>With the development of smartphone video games, more entertainment online, more immersive and time-consuming games where the mind is put on pause, you have fewer people thinking and questioning whoever is in charge.</p>
<h3>11. Celebrations</h3>

<p>Ah, Halloween. Another hardly disguised consumerist celebration. Occulting the autumn equinox and All Saints’ Day, trampling the tradition of family meals and flowering the graves of our loved ones, one pack of cheap lollies at a time. Overpriced costumes and diabetes for the kids, slutty behaviour and bad decisions for the grownups. Well, at least the pumpkin farmers thank you.</p>
<p>Santa Claus, invented by Coca Cola, pulverized Saint Nicolas that my father used to sing about and greet as a child. The cries of ungrateful brats under the Christmas tree because Barbie’s caravan does not include the picnic table replaced the Christmas carols. My grandfather used to say “When I was a child, we got an orange and a candy stick for Christmas. If we did not behave, we got a bag of coal. So don’t complain.”</p>
<h3>12. Work</h3>

<p>The salaries often drop to the legal minimum since Mr. Ford introduced his magic recipe for greater profit. You don’t want to work? We’ll hire someone more desperate that will. You are a number, we are a corporation and we have goals. The employees are highly replaceable cogs in this ugly new machine.</p>
<p>Back in the day, we could call a spade a spade in the workplace. The hard workers, with their fists like anvils that were the pride of our nation, getting smashed on red wine in the morning while smoking Gauloises and farting before whistling at the nice girl that was passing by, are muzzled or slowly replaced by robots.</p>
<p>With political correctness, you can’t joke, you can’t fart without offending the office’s year-round victim. Work used to be a place of manliness and brilliant banter, now it is a circus of tap-dancing haughty wusses, hypochondriacs, and harpies always between two pregnancy leaves.</p>

<p>Don’t be fooled—you are next on their list. Their end game is to submerge us into one big melting pot of global consumerism, to uproot every individual from an identity and heritage and replace that with the global shopping mall, and the “global village.”</p>
