<p>One of the main practices men are encouraged to take up on this site is the nearly forgotten art of reading. While many will tell you that only non-fiction will do, it doesn’t hurt to catch up on works of fiction as well. Science fiction in particular can give you a unique glimpse at how we got where we are, and where we are headed.</p>
<p>H.G. Wells predicted today’s world of socially oblivious, barely lingual lotus-eaters in his 1895 novel <em>The Time Machine</em>. Isaac Asimov <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/70475/how-america-is-becoming-a-real-life-sci-fi-dystopia">predicted the isolation wrought upon us by smartphones and laptops</a> in his 1957 novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Sun-Robot-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553293397/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452957819&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Naked+Sun&amp;tag=rok0f-20"><em>The Naked Sun</em></a>. In that same vein, Joe Haldeman predicted the LGBT’s hijacking of the West in his 1974 novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forever-War-Joe-Haldeman/dp/0312536631/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452957847&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Forever+War&amp;tag=rok0f-20"><em>The Forever War</em></a>.</p>
<h3>The Plot</h3>
<p>The story’s main protagonist is a physics student named William Mandella, and the entire story is told in the first person perspective. He’s conscripted into the United Nations Exploratory Force (UNEF), which is waging a war against a mysterious alien race called Taurans. To reach their objectives, Mandella and his brothers in arms must travel through wormhole-like phenomena called “collapsars,” which allow them to move thousands of light-years in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>There’s a catch, however: inherent in this mode of travel is a substantial time dilation effect, which means as days pass for those who travel through the collapsars, months and even years pass for those back on Earth. The bulk of the story deals with Mandella’s back-and-forth travels between Earth and the front lines. Each time he comes back to Earth—which occurs every few decades in real time—he is leveled by an almost overwhelming culture shock:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But to Tell you something about this world, I’m going to turn you over to Captain Sin, who just arrived from Earth. Captain?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, General.” It looked as if there was something wrong with his skin, his face; and then I realized he was wearing powder and lipstick..</p>
<p>“I’m twenty-three, so I was still in diapers when you people left for Aleph [a planet thousands of light-years from earth]…to begin with, how many of you are homosexual? Nobody, huh? That doesn’t really surprise me. I am, of course. I guess about a third of everybody in Europe and America is. Most governments encourage homosexuality—the United Nations is neutral, leaves it up to the individual countries—they encourage homo-life mainly because it’s the one sure method of birth control.”</p>
<p>That seemed specious to me. Our method of birth control in the army is pretty foolproof: all men making a deposit in the sperm bank, and then vasectomy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point in Earth history, crime is rampant due to lack of jobs, and health care has become such a highly-politicized racket that the entire system has basically collapsed upon itself. Mandella comes home to see his mother, only to find that since his father’s death, she has taken a female lover.</p>
<p>Disoriented and disillusioned by the world he’s come back to, Mandella goes back on active duty, only to receive another shocking revelation when he gets to the other side and meets with a temporal orientation guide tasked with catching him up on current events:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want to prepare you for meeting your Strike Force.”</p>
<p>“What, they’re all cyborgs? Clones?”</p>
<p>He laughed. “No, it’s illegal to clone humans. The main problem is, uh, you’re heterosexual.”</p>
<p>“Oh’ that’s no problem. I’m tolerant.”</p>
<p>“Yes, your profile shows that you…<em>think</em> you’re tolerant, but that’s not the problem, exactly.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” I knew what he was going to say. Not the details, but the substance.</p>
<p>“Only emotionally stable people are drafted into UNEF. I know this is hard for you to accept, but heterosexuality is considered an emotional dysfunction. Relatively easy to cure.”</p>
<p>“If you think they’re going to cure me–”</p>
<p>“Relax, you’re too old.” He took a delicate sip of his drink. “It won’t be as hard to get along with them as you might–”</p>
<p>“Wait. You mean nobody…everybody in my company is homosexual? But me?”</p>
<p>“William, <strong>everybody on earth is homosexual</strong>. Except for a thousand or so; veterans and incurables.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The temporal orientation officer goes on to explain to Mandella how Earth’s population has stabilized at just under a billion people, and that humans no longer reproduce by conventional means: they’re incubated in artificial wombs and “born” in a matter of days, to which Mandella derisively responds, “O brave new world…no birth trauma, just a billion perfectly adjusted homosexuals.”</p>
<p>During a conversation with the ship’s doctor and several other officers, our protagonist also learns that decades prior to his arrival, an aversion to homosexuality was deemed a crime, until it was later deemed a “curable dysfunction.”</p>
<h3>Where We’ve Been, Where We Are Now, And Where We’re Being Dragged Off To</h3>

<p>Anybody over age fifty is probably experiencing culture shock akin to what William Mandella did throughout Haldeman’s novel. Think about it for a moment. Forty years ago, the Sexual Revolution was about men and women experimenting with drugs and free love with one another, and the LGBT was a nascent, fledgling offshoot of that revolution that people rarely heard from outside of the Stonewall Riots.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, the LGBT started to get more media attention and special interest groups began to dredge for dollars, as AIDS and AIDS research became the issues of the day. Homosexuals had started to garner sympathy, but even though the American Psychiatric Association was pressured into removing homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, people at large still deemed the gay lifestyle to be largely abnormal and detrimental to society.</p>
<p>Gays didn’t seem to mind operating on the fringes of society back then: in fact, they would oftentimes derisively refer to heterosexuals as “breeders” who would never know the “joys” of life with multiple sex partners and no responsibilities.</p>
<p>Then, in 1990, three homosexual couples attempted to obtain marriage licenses in Hawaii, and sued when their requests were refused. Oddly enough, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund–one of the LGBT’s leading legal pitbulls–declined to represent them, as it reportedly debated the importance of marriage itself and whether taking the matter to court was a wise strategy.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Hawaii held in <em>Baehr v. Miike</em> that the state legislature had the right to restrict licenses to mixed-gender couples, and the Defense of Marriage Act was passed in 1996 in large part due to the events surrounding the case.</p>
<p>It seemed like the issue could finally be laid to rest, but then, in 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its <em>Lawrence v. Texas</em> ruling, which prevented states from criminalizing homosexual sexual activities. Armed with the government’s first official sanctioning of anal sex and coprophilia, a plethora of legal measures began to fall like dominoes. All of a sudden, gays, for the first time in decades, suddenly realized that the states had apparently been denying them certain “rights,” even though they hadn’t sought or even cared about these “rights” in the past.</p>
<p>Civil unions began sprouting up all over the place. Adoption laws changed. Before long, “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” was a thing of the past, and DOMA was eviscerated. Liberal jurists, armed with a warped interpretation of <em>Loving v. Virginia</em> and the chant of “gay is the new black” in one hand and payoffs from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/05/marriage-equality-amicus_n_6808260.html">pro-LGBT businesses </a>in the other summarily trampled on the 10th Amendment rights of the states.</p>
<p>All of this set the stage for the <em>Obergefell</em> ruling this past June, which made a prominent addition to a long and ever-lengthening line of U.S. Supreme Court blunders. Now, we’re facing the prospect of living in a society <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/12/18/3733584/sexual-orientation-sex-title-ix-pepperdine/">where gender and sexual orientation are legally treated as “fluid” concepts</a> and men can walk into women’s bathrooms anytime they feel like it, no questions asked.</p>
<h3>Welcome To The Dystopia</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3751" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/you-are-this-gay-funny-joker-pictures.jpg" alt="you-are-this-gay-funny-joker-pictures" width="498" height="328"></p>
<p>Brothers, we are only two steps away from finding ourselves smack-dab in the middle of the world anticipated in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Forever-War-Joe-Haldeman/dp/0312536631/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452957847&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Forever+War&amp;tag=rok0f-20"><em>The Forever War</em></a>. Forty years ago, the American nuclear family–consisting of a strong, level-headed man, a faithful, dutiful wife and respectful children–was not only considered the gold standard in terms of familial structures; but was in fact the ONLY standard.</p>
<p>Now, every five minutes, from Campbell’s Soup commercials to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/73998/wells-fargo-indoctrinates-tv-viewers-with-pro-immigrant-propaganda">Wells Fargo ads</a>, the mainstream media is bombarding us with a torrential downpour of ultra-liberal propaganda. Just about every show on television nowadays either has a gay, lesbian, or trans-something character or actor on it (<em>Transparent</em>, <em>Sense8</em> and <em>Orange is the New Black</em> immediately come to mind).</p>
<p>ANYTHING is a family now, and all types of sexual activities (except heterosexual activities conducive to stable relationships, of course), are encouraged. And if you don’t agree, you’re charged with committing <em>thoughtcrime</em> and are ostracized at best, and <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/29/oregon-bakery-owners-pay-more-than-135g-in-damages-over-refusal-to-make-cake-for-gay-wedding.html">economically steamrolled at worst</a>. And as the LGBT’s staunchest allies will tell you, they’re just getting warmed up.</p>
<p>All of this took place in the space of a generation. How long before forced reeducation camps are set up to re-program those who aren’t willing to don pink tutus and declare that “gay is okay”? For that matter, <strong>how long before being heterosexual in and of itself becomes a crime</strong>? That’s not as farfetched as you may think.</p>
<p>As the concept of “family” continues to be warped and contorted, gender roles continue to be redefined, men and women continue to be placed at odds with each other by those who would love nothing more than to see millions of single people wandering around, disillusioned by failed heterosexual relationships and ripe for the picking, and every act engaged in by heterosexual males ranging from “man-spreading” and speaking to women on the street to <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2015-05-27/news/62677580_1_law-professor-consent-law-enforcement">exaggerating about having a new car or job is deemed a criminal offense</a>, can we really say we’re far from that reality now?</p>
<p>And just like in Haldeman’s novel, we’re seeing this thing spread like wildfire all over the globe, so those who think they can just go to a remote island, kick back, and enjoy the decline are in for a rude awakening. Gentlemen, it’s time for us to take back the pen, take back the sword, take back the mike, and start drafting the future we want to see ourselves and our families living in, before it’s too late.</p>
