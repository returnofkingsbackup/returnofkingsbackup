<p>On February 6, 2016 at 8PM, readers of Return Of Kings, <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com">Roosh V Forum</a>, and <a href="http://www.rooshv.com">my blog</a> will have the opportunity to meet other like-minded men in their cities. The meetup on February 6 will hopefully be the start of fixed and regular meetups that serve men in their local communities in a way that internet platforms do not.</p>
<h4>The Problem</h4>
<p>The internet is great for sharing information and building e-relationships, but it often does not bridge the gap to create real friendships, allow for male bonding, and offer concrete aid or help. I hope you agree that having 100 e-friends does not surpass having one real friend who understands you, shares your world view, and is accessible with a phone call or short drive away.</p>
<p>While many of you certainly have normal friendships, chances are those friends are moderates who may not be dependable in times of crisis, and who may not defend you if a hostile enemy approaches. It’s important to develop the right friendships of men who have your back no matter what, just like men in Canada had my back last summer.</p>
<p>I’m in touch with a German man whose small city is currently the site of a government-sponsored relocation program for Afro-Islamists. He stated to me that his city has become more unsafe after dark and he’s starting to feel like a prisoner in his own home, especially since he does not have friendships there with men who are against the immigrant invasion. If he was connected to a tribe within his city, I have no doubt that he’d feel more safe while having the means to improve the situation caused by his government to displace him and reduce his standard of living.</p>
<h4>The Solution</h4>
<p>I aim to help men create tribes in cities throughout the world that operate independently of each other. Each tribe will be maintained by a chief that runs it in a way he sees fit. Very little information will be given to me, especially concerning personal information of the tribe’s members. If I get shut down for whatever reason, the tribes will be able to continue operation. If one tribe dissipates from inactivity, it will not affect other tribes.</p>
<p>During peace-time, I advise tribes to meet at least twice a month on a regular schedule over coffee or drinks (e.g. every 1st and 3rd Thursday of the month at 8pm). The atmosphere will be relaxed and you’ll be able to talk about women, politics, travel, work, or whatever else interests you. During times of crisis, however, when members are threatened due to the actions of outsiders or their own government, the tribe will be utilized to offer concrete support and defense. Hopefully that day will never come, but odds are it will, and you need to establish relationships with men you trust <em>before</em> a threat arrives.</p>
<p>Tribal meetings will not tolerate the promotion of illegal actions and will not engage in violence. Any man that suggests violent activity will be seen as a provocateur or government agent.</p>
<h4>The First Meeting</h4>
<p>To get the ball rolling, I will help organize your city’s first meetup on February 6. What I ask is for men who can host the meetup in their city to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dP16lCKD5TJdr2llA7ASQwNVGaCFihvGo2x2vDm7CS0/viewform">click here and fill out this form</a>. A potential host should be able to…</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<ul>
<li>Arrive on time to a public landmark of his choosing (the landmark location will be posted publicly). <strong>Important</strong>: submit an outdoor landmark to initially meet, not the actual bar or cafe you will walk to and sit in. It would be very helpful if you include an image link to the meeting point within the form.</li>
<li>Gather attendees through the use of a code phrase</li>
<li>Direct men by foot to the meeting location that you choose (e.g. a nearby cafe or bar)</li>
<li>Be a welcoming host</li>
<li>Gather contact information of attendees (email or phone number) to invite them to potential future meetups</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a host has four meetups in a row, I will add his tribe to the <a href="http://www.tribalmeeting.co">Tribal Meeting map</a> so future men can contact him and join.</p>
<h4>The Next Step</h4>
<p>If you would like a tribe in your city then I ask you to step up by volunteering to host the meeting on February 6. If a city has no host on that date, there can be no meetup. Big cities like New York City, London, and Los Angeles may have multiple hosts in different parts of town. <strong>If you can host, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dP16lCKD5TJdr2llA7ASQwNVGaCFihvGo2x2vDm7CS0/viewform">fill out this form no later than January 16</a> and wait for word back from me.</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to attend the meetup on February 6 but are unable to host, simply wait for a follow-up article that gives further instructions.</p>
<p>Here is the operation schedule:</p>
<p>January 4-16: Open call for hosts<br>
January 19: Publication of public landmark meeting locations<br>
February 6: Meetup at 8pm in your city</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>There are currently <a href="http://tribalmeeting.co/">three tribes</a>, located in Chicago, Washington DC, and Poznan (Poland). I’ve participated with two of them, so I’ve seen firsthand how valuable they are in providing a venue for men to be men, reviving the “men’s club” idea of old. I can state that my time spent in these two cities is better because of the tribes’ existence.</p>
<p>Each of the three tribes currently serves a masculine function, but if economic collapse, internal decline, and mass migration accelerate, negatively affecting members’ quality of life, they will serve as much more. At that critical juncture, I hope the tribe will be able to counterbalance hardships on its members by giving them a means to take the right actions to support and defend themselves, their family, and their city.</p>
<p>Every man gets to choose his level of involvement. I present the idea and the logistics today, and now it’s up to you to decide where to take it.</p>
