<p>For several years the liberal establishment has been pointing out that “rape culture” has made the West as dangerous for women as an African slum. We’ve been told that native-born men, because they weren’t taught how not to rape, have been raping with impunity in universities, clubs, bars, and on dates. So much raping has been going on that by now you’ve certainly stumbled on dozens of rapes while they were in progress. Even I’ve been called a “rape teacher” and “rape instructor” more times than I can count, all because I give men tools for having consensual sex in the most efficient (and legal) way possible.</p>
<p>This week, news broke of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/77028/congratulations-to-feminists-for-helping-import-actual-rape-culture-to-germany">a Syrian refugee rape mob assaulting dozens of women in Cologne, Germany</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On New Year’s Eve, 1,000 men described as Arab and North African sexually assaulted 90 women in the German city of Cologne. Instead of being random, separate assaults dispersed across a very large city in the country’s most populous state, they all occurred in the vicinity of the Central Station, or Hauptbahnhof. Wolfgang Albers, the local police chief, called the incident (more like, dozens of incidents) “a completely new dimension of crime.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I expected the establishment to immediately start programs or make posters that teach Syrian men how not to sexually assault German women. Instead, they have instructed <em>women</em> how to take responsibility for their safety, an action that they’ve been insisting for years is the same as “blaming the victim.” Because of this blatant double standard, we can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that “rape culture” is nothing more than a political weapon to harm and marginalize Western men. It has nothing to do with keeping women safe and everything to do with emasculating Western men and removing their due process when it comes to sexual encounters.</p>
<p>Immigrants and refugees can quite literally roam the streets and grab whichever German woman they want without getting criticized by politicians while a woman who <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/55168/new-revelations-suggests-mattress-rape-victim-emma-sulkowicz-made-it-all-up">falsely claimed to have been raped in a dorm room</a> by a German man (ironically enough) gets invited by an American Congressman to the State Of The Union address. Welcome to insanity.</p>

<h4>The double standard is so ridiculous that German liberals are using my talking points</h4>
<p>One year ago, <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/how-to-stop-rape">I posted a thought experiment</a> about how if we made rape legal, women would have no choice but to keep themselves safe and take the proper actions to minimize the chances they will be raped. Here is the take-home message from that article:</p>
<blockquote><p>If a woman is indeed a child then maybe we really need to keep promoting “rape culture” as a way to keep them safe, but if they are actual adults, which is often claimed, then <strong>we can start treating them like adults by allowing them to take responsibility for the things that happen to them which are easily preventable</strong> with barely a strain of cognitive thought, awareness, and self control.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/roosh-v-make-rape-legal-5193802">went viral</a> and I was roundly criticized by the media and their feminist foot soldiers of being a monster and evil person who wants women to be violently ravaged. Because of it, I was accosted by a mob in Montreal that repeatedly called me a “rapist,” even though <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-accusation-that-im-a-rapist-is-a-malicious-lie">I have never been accused of rape</a>.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/4uRKv0DfOvk%3Frel=0.html" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>It’s important to note that my work has also never been linked to a single sexual assault conviction out of the 100,000+ men who read my work. Therefore not a single rape has ever been attributed to me or my writing, which statistically must be below the average, and yet because I demand women account for their own personal safety while simultaneously teaching men game tools that take advantage of the sexual dystopia <em>that feminists helped create</em>, I’m attacked alongside my readers.</p>
<h4>Cologne has dealt a body slam to the narrative</h4>

<p>Based on the unrelenting criticisms we’ve received in the manosphere, you would think that the Western establishment is singularly focused on reducing harm to women by changing the behavior of men. Of course you would be wrong. On New Year’s Eve in Germany, mobs of refugees went around molesting, grabbing, and in some cases outright raping German women. Instead of outrage directed at these men for their crimes, many of which had multiple witnesses, the German authorities have told women that they need to protect themselves. Useful idiots in the media said we <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/germany-springs-to-action-over-hate-speech-against-migrants/2016/01/06/6031218e-b315-11e5-8abc-d09392edc612_story.html">shouldn’t be so racist to the refugees</a>. The rapists have been given a pass because the assailants are a protected class in the perverse multicultural narrative.</p>
<p>Instead of re-consider their open-borders policy from the bowels of the Middle East, German politicians told women that they should defend themselves more properly and have a “<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/mayor-of-cologne-says-women-should-have-code-of-conduct-to-prevent-future-assault-a6798186.html">code of conduct</a>” to not get raped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speaking on live television this afternoon, [Cologne] mayor Henriette Reker, who was near-fatally stabbed in the run up to October elections by an anti mass migration campaigner, said in future women would have to be better prepared in her city to deal with migrants. She remarked: “The women and young girls have to be more protected in the future so these things don’t happen again.</p>
<p>“This means, they should go out and have fun, but they need to be better prepared, especially with the Cologne carnival coming up. For this, we will publish online guidelines that these young women can read through to prepare themselves”. [<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/05/cologne-mayor-women-careful-migrant-mass-rapes-promises-guidance-can-prepare/">Source</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even more absurd, the Cologne mayor advised German women to remain <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/twitter-storm-as-cologne-mayor-suggests-women-stay-at-arms-length-from-strangers/a-18962430">at an “arm’s length” from strangers</a>. Refugees get exempted for their behavior and women are told to accommodate their predation, while American, British, Canadian, Australian, and European men are assumed to be born rapists who must be taught how not to rape, even when they’ve never been accused of a crime or any prior act of wrongdoing. What happened to stopping rape culture? What happened to “toxic masculinity”? What happened to safe spaces? All gone in the same amount of time it takes for a New Year’s Eve firework to explode in the German atmosphere.</p>
<h4>The scam of “rape culture”</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-77130" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/merkel.jpg" alt="merkel" width="562" height="255" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/merkel.jpg 604w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/merkel-300x136.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/merkel-262x119.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/merkel-574x260.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px"></p>
<p>What’s happening in Germany reveals that there never was a rape culture in the West, and there never was concern for women’s safety, but that promoting it was but one means <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/letter-from-a-member-of-the-global-elite">to allow the establishment to expedite their subversion of Western societies</a>, to weaken and demoralize the men, to sterilize the women with “empowered” careers, abortions, and casual sex, and to break up the family unit and make everyone dependent on corporations and the welfare state instead of each other.</p>
<p>Today, I am a vindicated man. I’m vindicated because the establishment of an entire country has exposed the lie which I’ve been pointing out for years. This week they were forced to contradict their own narrative, one that we’ve long been claiming is obviously false, by enabling, promoting, and protecting a genuine rape culture of Middle Eastern refugees who are invited, fed, and sheltered by the state. Are you feeling enriched yet?</p>
<p>Now that the whole world sees the double standard through which “rape culture” is being applied, only one of two outcomes can happen. The first is that the establishment completely drops the rape culture narrative, stops treating Western men like criminals who need to be taught how not to rape women, scales back the anti-male “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62467/new-york-has-adopted-yes-means-yes">affirmative consent</a>” laws, and kicks out the refugees that are turning European cities into third-world hellholes.</p>
<p>The second outcome is that they continue to selectively use the rape culture weapon against Western men while giving refugees a pass, a mammoth contradiction that will infuriate the citizenry and accelerate the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/71182/the-multicultural-narrative-is-collapsing-before-our-eyes">collapse of the multicultural narrative</a> and those who use it to hold power. Millions will move over to nationalism, the only antidote that can put a stop to the sociopathic liberals currently in power. I think we all know which road we’re about to go down.</p>
