<p style="text-align: left;">The number one trending topic, one week into 2016, has turned out to be the charming hashtag of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wastehistime2016">#WasteHisTime2016</a>. If you’re on social media it’s more or less a given that you’re wasting your time, but it appears the lady philosophers of Facebook have decided to take the next step in bringing horrible men seeking companionship or sex to heel by…wasting their time.  Apparently the motive for this wonderful social innovation is “to get back at fuckboys” (i.e. for women to treat men the way they’ve apparently been treated when strung along for a while by a guy).</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Le sigh. </em>Not a sigh of exasperation, mind you — rather, a contented sigh from all of us here at <em>Return of Kings,</em> if not manosphere sites generally. This hashtag is likely to bring even more men to our cause. Why? In brief, the Law of Unintended Consequences. But let’s break it down for the ladies into five simple insights:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong> 1. If he’s a player, you’re not his only partner</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-34108" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/04/san-diego-state-alpha-phis-10.jpg" alt="san-diego-state-alpha-phis-10" width="403" height="302"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you’re dealing with a “fuckboy” or, in more technical terms, a player, you should understand that <em>he’s not just into you.</em> He’s not so fixated on the prospect of sex with you that you’re the only one he’s trying to (or having) sex <em>with</em>. Odds are on that there’s any number of women he’s interacting with similarly in the hopes of getting into their pants.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Little sister @Ellsafriqa, above, suggesting that her victim is not the only one she’s contacting, gets this because <em>that’s the exact behaviour she’s modelling.</em> She just hasn’t thought through what that behaviour means. The reality is that while you think you’re causing the player a major inconvenience or a broken heart, you’ve at best caused him to lose a few text messages when he’s going after—and banging—other women than you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. A player <em>doesn’t care</em> if he doesn’t get to fuck you</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-31997" src="wp-content/uploads/2014/03/alpha-male.jpg" alt="alpha male" width="451" height="299"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is partially a consequence of you not being the only girl he’s fucking, but the sort of men you are getting annoyed with usually have what we call an<em> abundance mentality</em>. The attitude is similar to that taught to good salesmen: you don’t care about, or indeed you <em>enjoy,</em> the 10, 20, 30, or even 99 times you didn’t get laid because <em>each failure gets you closer to a bang.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That being so, the sort of “fuckboy” you’re pissed at isn’t affected if you waste his time. He simply moves on to the next prospect. So: who <em>are</em> you inconveniencing, if not players? Read on.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. The guy you’re deceiving is <u><em>unlikely to be a player</em></u></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-66455" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nerd-300x228.jpg" alt="nerd" width="414" height="315" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nerd-300x228.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nerd-262x199.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nerd.jpg 530w" sizes="(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The majority of Western men have been conditioned by thirty to forty years of feminist browbeatings not to escalate relationships with women — or if they do, to escalate it timidly and ineptly. Men have been screamed at over twelve years of their public school educations that they’re all rapists and exploit women by their very existence. And they’ve been given contradictory if not flat-out wrong information about how a woman wants them to behave that does not match up with how she acts.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They are conditioned to not take the relationship further because they’ve been frightened into <em>incompetence. </em>Simply put, most of the good men orbiting you on social media have no idea how to seduce you or even to escalate their relationship without making you feel uncomfortable in the process.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p style="text-align: left;">Never doubt there is an art to seduction, an art we teach here — but it’s hard to master that art or submit to it when you’ve been screamed at for decades (and still are) by feminist idiots that all sex is rape, the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Art-Love-Modern-Library-Classics/dp/0375761179/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452291310&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ars+amatoria&amp;tag=rok0f-20">Ars Amatoria</a> </em>is <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mein-Kampf-Adolf-Hitler/dp/0395925037/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452291360&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Mein+Kampf&amp;tag=rok0f-20">Mein Kampf</a>, </em>and a relationship is more like an MMA bout than a tango.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The point being: the next guy you treat this way is not likely to be a fuckboy. He will much more likely be a guy crippled by years of indoctrination that he’s a sexual predator, consequently insecure about his interactions with you, and often unsure of himself or his masculinity. But worst of all – for you ladies – he’s still going to be a better prospect for a relationship than the player you’re trying to hurt will ever be.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong> 4. If he’s <u>not</u> a player, you’re likely to hurt him</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3910" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/01/injured-playerr.jpg" alt="injured-playerr" width="504" height="382"></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Despite what feminists will tell you, men are not, in fact, emotionless. The sort of man willing to put in the time to talk to you for weeks or months without escalating anything is often the sort of man who likes you and is praying that that somewhere in your solipsistic brain you’ll figure that out and maybe give him a chance to make you come. Or did you think all those likes and tweets of support were because he wanted to be nothing more than your friend?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When you fuck him over like that, he’s not likely to empathize with your rationalization that it’s justified because it was in payback to Chad Thundercock. What he will perceive is that you, a woman—supposedly the kinder sex—chose to coldly lead him on for weeks or months. And you didn’t even do it to spite <em>him</em>, you did it to spite <em>a guy who fucked you and left you</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is doubly humiliating for such a man, because not only are you rejecting him, you’re doing it because you can’t get over the guy who rejected <em>you. </em></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong> 5. When you do, he’s going to look for a solution</strong></h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">This is how you send that man to us. For all the attempts the education system makes to drug it out of them, men are solution-oriented. As a group we try to fix shit when it’s not working. The man you do this to won’t ask <em>you </em>how (he still has some pride, after all). When he gets this sort of stunt pulled on him, he’s going to turn to Google. He’s going to punch in search phrases like: “How can I succeed with women?” or “Why is she mean to me?” or “How to pick up girls?” or “Why do women behave like they do?”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That’s when he finds us, ladies. That’s when he learns the difference between what women say and what they do. That’s when he learns there’s a lot more to life than just a relationship with you. That’s when he learns the art of seduction. That’s when he accepts the principles of neomasculinity.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">And that’s when he learns to treat low-quality women the same way they once treated him.</p>
