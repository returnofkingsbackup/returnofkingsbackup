<p>The film <em>13 Hours </em>perfectly encapsulates why there is zero doubt that Hillary Clinton should be in prison. Every presidential candidate has stated that Clinton should be rotting in a cell, except Bernie Sanders who has said “No one gives a damn about your emails!” As a result of apparent late-onset Alzheimer’s, Sanders is oblivious to the facts. On the other hand, Donald Trump has sold out theaters in Iowa to give people <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/15/politics/donald-trump-13-hours-iowa/">free tickets to see the film.</a></p>
<h3>13 Hours Movie Review</h3>
<div id="attachment_77992" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-77992 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/benghazi-explosion-e1453141138160.jpg" alt="benghazi explosion" width="500" height="252"><p class="wp-caption-text">Benghazi on fire.</p>
</div>
<p>On September 11<sup>th</sup>, 2012, approximately 150 Islamic militants stormed an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. <em>13 Hours</em> is a film directed by Michael Bay that portrays what happened over the course of that night.</p>
<p>The focus of the film is on six members of an elite security team assigned to Benghazi, Libya. They are independent contractors for the CIA, all former special forces military veterans. The members of the team are Jack (John Krasinski), Rone (James Badge Dale), Tanto (Pablo Schreiber), Boon (Dave Denman), Tig (Dominic Fumusa), and Oz (Max Martini).</p>
<p>There is a constant power struggle between the security team and the CIA chief on whether they have to obey him when the compound housing U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens is attacked. The six-man team repeatedly voices their desire to help defend the compound and rescue the ambassador, but they’re ordered to “stand down” by the CIA chief (David Costabile). Bureaucracy at its finest.</p>
<p>After seeing the mayhem from afar as the compound burns and is rushed by combatants, the team tells the CIA chief to fuck off and goes to rescue Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Throughout the brutal ordeal, calls are made to U.S. bases in Germany and Italy for air support and rescue. At one point a character requests for nothing more than an F-16 to fly overhead to scare the militants to buy some more time. All requests are met with silence. No help ever arrives.</p>
<p>One scene in particular involving the Ambassador and his staff locked in a bathroom trying to stay silent as militants raid the compound is particularly harrowing. The ordeal shows the militants failing to break a barrier, preventing them from entering the section of the house where the Ambassador is located. They decide to pour diesel on the floor, light the place on fire, and wait.</p>

</div>
<p>As a fan of the series The Office, the casting of John Krasinski was surprising. However, he plays the role with the right balance of strength and realistic expectations for the outcome of that fateful night. His conflict between the duties of his job and the love he feels for his family evoked scenes from American Sniper. Most of the men in the cast are sporting beards, which are gaining in popularity because it is one of the few ways men can display their masculinity in our castrated society. But that’s another story. Krasinski exudes the American ideal, one that may not exist for much longer.</p>
<p>For all the artistic liberties taken with the firefights and explosions, this movie portrays how trained men behave in high-pressure, violent situations. The security team remains calm, take enormous risks on behalf of their brothers, and fight until the end. There is only one woman in the cast, and at one point she asks, “How can I help?” It’s obvious that she cannot do anything worthwhile in a life and death situation other than make phone calls.</p>
<p>Overall, the action sequences are well-done. The film is remarkably restrained for Michael Bay.</p>
<p>This leads us to the question, what role does Hillary Clinton play in the death of Ambassador Stevens and the others?</p>
<h3>Hillary Clinton Ignores Requests For Increased Security</h3>
<div id="attachment_77996" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="size-full wp-image-77996" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/benghazi-2-e1453141455961.jpg" alt="No reason to be concerned. " width="500" height="278"><p class="wp-caption-text">No reason to be concerned.</p>
</div>
<p>Hillary Clinton has publicly taken responsibility <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/transcript-hillary-clinton-takes-responsibility-benghazi-attack-article-1.1246025">numerous times</a> for the massive gaps in security. Moreover, she has claimed that of the 600 requests for increased security in Benghazi, exactly zero ever reached her desk. The odds of that are infinitesimally small, especially in light of the fact that she was receiving reports on Libya from her “friend” Sydney Blumenthal.</p>

<p>Blumenthal is an archetypal political snake who lives in the shadows. A Clinton friend and confidant, he has maneuvered the Clinton’s shady past away from the public for over 30 years. He also played a role during Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial. Blumenthal has routinely provided Bill and Hillary Clinton with information about their Republican opponents during the process and how to create messages to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/22/politics/hillary-clinton-benghazi-sidney-blumenthal/">attack them</a>.</p>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph" style="background: #FEFEFE; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;">Clinton’s conspirator sent her 150 emails, all of which reached her desk. Yet somehow none of the 600 requests for security did. Clinton had time to take emails from her confidante to shield her from political fallout, but no time for emails to bolster security in an unstable region where a U.S. Ambassador was visiting.</p>
<p class="zn-bodyparagraph" style="background: #FEFEFE; margin: 0in 0in 11.25pt 0in;">What was Blumenthal’s role in Libya, anyway? He was advising business interests in Libya and also was doing work for the Clinton Foundation, the Clinton family’s sizable philanthropic endeavor. After Blumenthal testified, Blumenthal told reporters his work for the foundation had “nothing whatsoever to do with my emails to my friend.” Right.</p>

</div>
<p>The official narrative of Benghazi coming out of Clinton’s State Department is that the attack was the result of Libyans protesting a <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-innocence-of-muslims-disgusting-2012-9">video</a> called “Innocence of the Muslims.” It is now known that this is <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2016/01/15/video-benghazi-families-react-to-new-film-hillarys-accusations-n2104796">an outright fabrication</a>. The attack was perpetrated by Al Qaeda sympathizers who were gunning for the U.S. Ambassador and avenging the death of their comrade, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Yahya_al-Libi">Abu Yahya al-Libi</a>, who was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Morever, Clinton <a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2015/12/08/whoa-hillary-says-benghazi-families-are-wrong-she-didnt-blame-attacks-on-internet-video-n2090274">was well aware</a> that this video was not the reason this attack occurred. In an email with the Egyptian Prime Minister, she admitted that the “attack had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack – not a protest.”</p>
<p>But why would she lie about this? One reason is self-preservation. After 600 requests for security and no response, a terrorist attack would reflect very poorly on Clinton’s judgment. She took the calculated risk that her political reputation could handle a “protest about a video” but could not handle a terrorist attack resulting in the death of Americans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, consider when this attack took place: 56 days before the 2012 presidential election. The democratic leadership was complicit in Clinton’s deceit because they knew that a terrorist attack so close to an election may have resulted in a Romney victory, a risk they were not willing to take. The Obama campaign in 2012 could survive a “protest about a video,” but not a terrorist attack resulting in the death of Americans.</p>
