<p>In recent times, Twitter founder and current CEO Jack Dorsey has fully embraced the social justice warrior narrative and clamped down on free speech that hurts progressives’ fragile feelings. He’s now paying a huge price for it as Twitter’s share price tanks, despite only being floated in November, and many of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-twitter-shakeup-20160125-story.html">its most important executives have run away</a>. His current losses are an amazing $1.25 billion in just four months.</p>
<p>In October, the then 38-year-old publicly gushed, like a child on Christmas Day, about having met Black Lives Matter “leader” DeRay Mckesson, who has committed himself to very angrily dividing America on the basis of fabricated race issues. Dorsey then watched, undoubtedly with glee, as <a href="http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2016/01/11/milo-yiannopoulos-verified-twitter-for-being-conservative/">Milo Yiannopoulos was unverified</a> for daring to disagree with rabid feminists, such as Harvard PhD student <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/77408/if-you-proclaim-white-people-as-awful-youre-good-enough-for-harvards-phd-program">Holly “White People Are Awful” Wood</a>. Most recently, popular alt-righter @jokeocracy was terminated for questioning the liberal left narrative:</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/DuckKnightRises/status/691817688738484224</p>
<p>Similarly, <em>ROK</em>‘s own Matt Forney <a href="http://mattforney.com/freemattforney-ive-unjustly-suspended-twitter/">had his account suspended</a> in December, even after users who made repeated physical threats against him were not banned. GotNews.com founder Chuck C. Johnson is another prominent non-leftist thrown to the pseudo-abuse scrapheap by the openly pro-SJW Twitter police.</p>
<h3 class="r">Had some tough months, Jack?</h3>

</div>
<p><em>CNN Money</em>, among other mainstream outlets, also noticed how Twitter’s new anti-abuse crusade, launched in very late 2015, had “backfired.” Instead of stopping actual threats and so-called “violence,” the company’s campaign fully created the firestorm kicked off by the completely non-transparent treatment towards Yiannopoulos. This sham toolkit for “stopping harassment” follows earlier efforts, such as when <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/02/twitter-releases-new-suite-of-anti-harassment-tools-promises-faster-response-times/">Twitter rushed to save SJWs</a> like Anita Sarkeesian from articulate criticism.</p>
<p>Forbes estimated Dorsey’s fortune at <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/katevinton/2016/01/20/jack-dorsey-no-longer-billionaire-as-square-and-twitter-shares-fall/#1c55e3046833">$2.2 billion in September</a>. This fell to $1.4 billion after Twitter became a public company in November and then dipped further to $944 million just after the middle of this month. Interestingly, for the majority of this time, Dorsey has been the permanent CEO, having come into the role after Dick Costolo departed. Thinking himself a better businessman than social media founder, he has expertly steered his corporate ship into the sharpest of rocks.</p>

<p>The tweets above illustrate the sort of free speech Twitter is committed to and explains why the platform is dying, with user growth plummeting over previous months and revenue nosediving. When users like <a href="https://twitter.com/catrincooper/">@catrincooper</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/girlziplocked/">@girlziplocked</a> call retweeting someone’s own comments abuse and harassment, and then a zealous white knight <a href="https://twitter.com/yipe/status/685509527005872128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Twitter manager</a> dobs the naughty retweeter into the big boss Jack, you know the platform is getting beyond precious.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Twitter didn’t expect Milo’s sympathizers to make #JeSuisMilo <a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/01/09/twitter-unverifies-outspoken-conservative-journalist-its-unlikely-it-ever-expected-this-response-in-return/">the number one</a> Twitter trend in the US. What we at <em>ROK</em> did expect was that Twitter would remove the hashtag from its list of trending topics once it become so popular, which the platform indeed did.</p>
<p><em>The Los Angeles Times</em> shows how the revolt against this anti-free speech farce has not just been coming from supporters of Yiannopoulos and civil liberties advocates. <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-twitter-shakeup-20160125-story.html">Eight of the 13 Twitter executives</a> who presented at the company’s analyst day last year have expressed their lack of belief in the “vision” of Dorsey and abruptly left.</p>
<h3 class="r">What this means for the raging culture war</h3>

<img src="https://recodetech.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/sheryl-sandberg.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=info&amp;w=640" alt="" width="500" height="375"><p class="wp-caption-text">Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has been front and center of the company’s collaborations with the German government to censor online criticism of Berlin’s open border immigration “policy”.</p>
</div>
<p>Jack Dorsey <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is</span> was a billionaire. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Facebook, which is working in tandem with the German government to <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/07/cologne-google-facebook-twitter-yield-german-govt-demand-censor-anti-migrant-hate-speech/">eradicate any online criticism of Germany’s demographic suicide</a>, is a multibillionaire. These men represent powerful forces going out of their way to stop debate, not through sound reason or logic but instead through the brute force of their money and an ability to control the mediums people use to communicate online.</p>
<p>Dorsey’s self-inflicted financial knifing demonstrates that there are limits to what many people will take from arrogant tech founders who think that their social and political sense matches their coding or computer abilities. Figures like Milo Yiannopoulos, although they can thankfully make a living from their contrarian viewpoints, have none of the institutional or corporate power of a Jack Dorsey or Mark Zuckerberg. They operate on the basis of ideas, not monopolistic privilege. This only makes their achievements in fighting back even more impressive and worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>Twitter’s status as one of the most popular social media platforms (up until now) does not make it immune to a backlash from disgruntled or plain disinterested users. Dorsey, like many other social media founders, thinks that because people latched onto his initial idea of 140 character public messages that they will stomach whatever else he or his company foists upon them, including draconian anti-free speech diktats window-dressed as “anti-abuse policies.”</p>
<p>We can safely say that Twitter’s bomb of a share price performance over the last few months thoroughly disproves Jack Dorsey’s self-aggrandizing belief.</p>
