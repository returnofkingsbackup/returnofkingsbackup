<p>Women are claiming to have mental illnesses and personality disorders at record high numbers. A girl is far more likely to be diagnosed with a disorder now than in previous generations. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/21/one-in-four-women-psych-meds">Recent studies</a> have shown that today, 1 in 4 women take medication for bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, or another illness.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this massive increase? Some argue that it is because our society has pushed women to pursue soulless corporate careers, leading them to numb themselves with medication. However, today a girl has other motives for labeling herself with a mental condition. In this article, I will outline five reasons why girls pretend to have mental disorders.</p>
<h3>1. To get away with being sluts</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-79175 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bp12-e1454203817347.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
<p>Two of the most common disorders girls claim to have are bipolar and borderline personality disorder. Guess which symptoms both have in common? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/bipolar-disorder/print.html">Extreme promiscuity</a>. A girl with with BPD has <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3071095/">twice as many</a> sexual partners than average, engages in more casual sex, and loses her virginity at a younger age. She also tends to experience more high-risk sexual behaviors. She is more likely to be pressured into having sex, raped by someone they do not know, or the victim of date rape. This matches the description of the modern woman.</p>
<h3>2. To avoid responsibility</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79176" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bp13-e1454204451222.jpg" alt="bp13" width="500" height="249"></p>
<p>With medication, girls often seem to improve. She is able to hold down a job and behave like an adult. Yet often she will stop taking her medication—for bipolar disorder, within <a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/196/1/59">one year</a> 50% of women will relapse. This allows her to continue her reckless pursuit of gratification without taking responsibility for her actions. She can blame the disease for her behavior, and blame it yet again for her urge to discontinue her medication. Very convenient. Her disorder also allows her to claim “mood swings” for her erratic actions.</p>
<h3>3. To receive attention</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79180" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BP7.jpg" alt="BP7" width="477" height="328" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BP7.jpg 477w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BP7-300x206.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/BP7-262x180.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px"></p>
<p>It is a widely known yet still ignored statistic that men commit suicide at <a href="http://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/.">3.5 times</a> the rate of women. Consider it our way of checking our privilege. On the other hand, women <em>attempt</em> suicide at <em>4 times the rate of men.</em> How is it possible that girls attempt suicide more often, yet the fatalities for men are so much higher?</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Once again, girls are faking. This is a very effective method for the modern woman to receive attention. When “mood swings” and “depression” aren’t enough, she will result to swallowing a handful of Tylenol PM and revel in the attention of her family, friends, and orbiters. Even in milder cases, exhibiting the symptoms of a crazy person allows her to receive more units of attention on her social media accounts.</p>
<h3>4. To feel special</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79179" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bp13-1-e1454205219744.jpg" alt="bp13" width="300" height="451"></p>
<p>The modern woman has a burning desire to be a snowflake, but in our increasingly commoditized lives, she is finding it harder than ever to stand out from the crowd. For her, 1000 “likes” for a semi-nude selfie is no longer enough validation. She gets bored with the usual compliments from men she keeps around to inflate her self-esteem.</p>
<p>She will then act out, treat the people around her horribly, and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/9482/dont-date-girls-with-borderline-personality-disorder">claim a disorder</a> to garner sympathy. In Western societies, it won’t be long until taking medication for personality disorders is viewed as a status symbol in the same vein as having the latest iPhone.</p>
<h3>5. So they can consume drugs and alcohol</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79181" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bp11.jpg" alt="bp11" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bp11.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bp11-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/bp11-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p><a href="http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/understanding-bipolar-disorder-symptoms">60% of girls</a> with bipolar disorder abuse drugs or alcohol. Our increasingly degenerate society has produced ennui in millennials on a level not seen in any living person’s lifetime. The lack of structure, family, and stability has formed a void within girls that they are desperate to fill. To alleviate this emptiness, she uses her so-called disorder to go off her prescribed medication and instead blow her local drug dealer for some molly or fuck bartenders for free drinks. Taking drugs is still seen as a minor taboo, and if she can blame <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/25-percent-of-american-women-are-mentally-ill">her illness</a> for her addiction, her life becomes much easier.</p>
<p>While mental illness was something that wouldn’t have been openly advertised just a couple of decades ago, it is now seen as a badge of honor in our increasingly voyeuristic and decadent times. Even celebrities like Britney Spears (bipolar) and Lena Dunham (OCD) have profited off of their “diagnoses” in their quest to become ersatz <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/78093/top-10-worst-female-role-models-in-the-entire-world">role models</a> for young women.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that this generation of Western women is unfit for commitment?</p>
