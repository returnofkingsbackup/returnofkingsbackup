<p>It is still unclear exactly why a young man took a knife and stabbed a 22-year-old woman to death at a Swedish child migrant centre earlier this week. The incident occurred on Monday morning and news of it has since spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, chances are it will happen again. The migrants carry with them anger, desperation, trauma, and what seems to be a complete lack of respect for European women. It’s a recipe for disaster now that many of them will be told that they have to go back to where they came from.</p>
<h3>Grown men posing as boys</h3>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3421150/First-picture-Six-foot-tall-15-year-old-Somali-boy-killer-Swedish-asylum-worker-appears-court-charged-murder.html" target="_blank">Daily Mail</a>, a young woman was killed when she tried to break up a fight. The knife was plunged into her back and thigh. She worked alone that morning at the centre, where she was in charge of ten “unaccompanied child refugees.” I put those words in quotation marks since it’s always unclear if the migrants are really who they claim to be. Posing as child refugees gives immigrants privileges that adults don’t get.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old, a psychology graduate, had told her mother that she was taking care of “big powerful guys” as old as 24, at a centre for minors. The suspected killer, a Somalian named Youssaf Khaliif Nuur, claims he’s 15 years old and came to Sweden last summer. A source from the Gothenburg Police says he “was not feeling well” in the hours before the killing. The Daily Mail’s correspondent watched him appear in court on Thursday and describes him as six-foot tall, “towering” over his translator. Based on the defendant’s looks, the correspondent estimates that he’s probably older than he says he is.</p>

<p>The young woman was a Lebanese Christian whose parents <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3418312/She-wanted-help-did-Mother-Swedish-refugee-worker-killed-Somali-migrant-says-country-fled-war-torn-Lebanon-no-longer-safe.html" target="_blank">came from Beirut</a> over 25 years ago. Her mother laments what has happened to Sweden over the last years, with a great influx of migrants. She says the country is “not safe” any longer, and blames politicians for the steep rise in immigration to her neighborhood of Mölndal, a suburb of Gothenburg. Yet her daughter, described as an “angel,” was devoted to helping the migrant youths.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stefan Löfven made a visit to Mölndal and said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="ext-gen120">This is a tragedy. It is a terrible crime. I think that a lot of people in Sweden feel a great worry that there might be more similar cases after Sweden took in so many unaccompanied children and youths.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Swedish Chief of Police Dan Eliasson also expressed his condolences—to the killer. “What has this person been through? What circumstances has that guy grown up under?” he asked rhetorically in a <a href="http://www.friatider.se/rikspolischefen-mmar-f-r-knivm-rdaren-vad-r-det-f-r-trauma-han-b-r-med-sig" target="_blank">TV interview</a>. “This whole refugee crisis shows how unfair life is in many parts of the world, and we should help and make sure to solve this to the best of our ability.”</p>

<h3>It won’t be the last time</h3>
<p>If our moron Prime Minister is right about anything, it’s that people are very worried right now, and they should be. There’s no reason to think that this will be the last time that one of these migrants goes nuts.</p>
<p>Women should probably be more concerned for their safety than men. First of all, women are typically weaker and less able to defend themselves. Secondly, these migrants from the Middle East and Africa have shown themselves to be ruthless toward women, even their own family. For example, a Kurdish man was found guilty this Tuesday of beating up his 21-year-old daughter with a club in a shopping mall in Uppsala. Her crime was that she dated an Iranian guy that her parents didn’t approve of.</p>
<p>Violence and turmoil at refugee centres are reported every week. The police doesn’t want information about it getting out, but they can’t cover up all the abuse, rape, and assaults that happen at migrant centres. The situation is likely to be exacerbated now that many of the immigrants are set to be deported.</p>
<p>Some of you may recall <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/krim/article21615544.ab" target="_blank">two murders</a> at IKEA in Västerås, Sweden last year. Abraham Ukbagabir killed a mother and her son using a knife from the store. Born in Eritrea, he came to Sweden after he had already been denied asylum in seven countries. When his application was denied yet again, he decided to take revenge on two complete strangers. The authorities had given him a ticket to Italy that same day.</p>

<img class="wp-image-78994 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/killer.jpg" alt="killer" width="500" height="282" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/killer.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/killer-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/killer-262x148.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Abraham Ukbagabir.</p>
</div>
<p>Now the Swedish government is preparing to send home 80,000 of the asylum seekers that came last year. Around 45 percent of about 160,000 applicants are expected to be rejected. Meanwhile, <a href="http://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2016/01/28/hs-finland-avvisar-60-procent-av-flyktingarna" target="_blank">Finland</a> is planning to deport 60 percent of the 32,000 people who applied for asylum there.</p>
<p>This means that in Sweden and Finland alone, 100,000 migrants will soon receive the news that they are no longer welcome to stay, and told to go back to the Third World hellhole they came from. My estimate is that they won’t be too happy about that. While deporting these migrants is necessary and right, we’re creating a powder keg of dismay and disappointment, ready to explode.</p>
<p>Some of them will lash out violently against the society which they think has treated them badly. We’ve seen it happen before. If I was a woman working with migrants, I’d start looking for a new job right now.</p>
