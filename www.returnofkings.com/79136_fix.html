<p>The establishment narrative is breaking down. You can just feel it. The lies that were sustainable for decades are no longer sustainable. They are collapsing under the weight of their own falsity. Where all this leads, is not yet certain. But change is definitely in the air.</p>
<p>In the American scene, the apparently unstoppable rise of Donald Trump has the cucked establishment running for cover and frantically trying to do damage control. All their usual tricks failed. They couldn’t shame him. They couldn’t buy him. And every media attack dog they set on him scurried away with its tail between its legs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-79138" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1-300x214.jpg" alt="narrative1" width="300" height="214" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1-300x214.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1-768x548.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1-837x597.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1-667x476.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1-262x187.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1-574x410.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative1.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>I read <a href="http://atimes.com/2016/01/the-resistible-rise-of-donald-trump/">one article</a> today by an establishment “journalist” named David Goldman, who writes under the pen name Spengler. He represents the epitome of the conservative establishment. And I’ve never been impressed by his articles. He’s almost always been proven wrong. He’s one of these guys who gets all the numbers right, but misses the deeper points.</p>
<p>But such people know where their interests lie. Make no mistake. And they are afraid. They know what is coming. It’s called payback. Or justice. Take your pick. But his article of his gives us a good glimpse into the mind of a fearful man. And he should be afraid. I want him to be afraid. Because his ilk has been lying, scamming, stealing, and bleeding this country for decades.</p>
<p>And the day of reckoning is coming. He knows it. And we know it. Spengler notes how the shambles of the US economy has led to the angry mood feeding Trump’s rise. He correctly notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>America’s embattled middle class doesn’t want charts and graphs, facts and statistics. It wants a leader who will identity culprits and take ruthless action. It’s a different electorate than I remember. My business partner in the late 1980s, the supply-sider Jude Wanniski, liked to say that the American people in its wisdom wanted a nice guy as president. They knew that the American president was the most powerful man in the world, and if he acted out of rancor the consequences could be terrible. Not any more. Americans want a nasty president.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then proceeds to equate Trump with Hitler, which, as we all know, is the last refuge for a man who has no legitimate argument to make. Simply call someone a fascist, and that’s the end of the argument. They’ve been doing this for decades, and it usually works. Spengler then concludes his article with this little comment, which is more telling than anything else:</p>
<blockquote><p>Donald Trump represents the triumph of resentment over hope. I don’t know what American voters will do. But I’m frightened.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good. Be frightened. We want you to be frightened. You ought to be frightened. Because you and your ilk sold us out, betrayed us to the core, and now you are going to pay.</p>
<p>Because people can see through the games of the cucks in power. The very fact that we now <a href="http://qcurtius.com/2015/11/14/cuckold-history-of-a-word/">have a name</a> (cucks) to identify them is a huge step forward. Because they want to hide. They don’t want us to know the truth about the games they have been playing.</p>

<p>People are furious. People are desperate.  No one is listening.  And it’s not just here in the United States.</p>
<h3>The narrative in Europe is beginning to unravel</h3>

<p>The tone of the European leadership seems to suggest that the demise of the EU as an institution may not be far off. Beset by numerous crises, failures of leadership, and the most pathetic, cowardly policies imaginable, the EU seems to be headed for the ashbin of history, like so many other temporary alliance systems.</p>
<p>As it should. The EU was never anything more than an ad hoc economic arrangement for the benefit for banks, financial institutions, and a few wealthy elites in Europe. And now that fact is being revealed for all the world to see.</p>

<p>The migrant crisis is bringing all of this to a head. It is exposing the elites for the lying, sniveling cucks that they are: people who sold out their nations and their inheritances because of their adherence to cultural decay and moral relativism.</p>
<p>They’re guilty, they’re fearful, and they know it.</p>

<p>Years of resentment against spineless politicians<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35451080"> finally exploded</a> in Sweden this weekend, as over 100 young men went on a rampage, assaulting young migrants in Stockholm. The assaults, loosely organized by a rightist youth group, put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the politicians for failing to protect Swedes from violent migrants. But the politicians, their minds poisoned by years of cultural pollution, simply don’t know what to do. One gets the sense that they are simply overwhelmed by events that they cannot control.</p>
<p>I suspect that if old Queen Christina of Sweden came back and saw what had become of her country, she would be horrified. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-35444173">One study</a> clearly shows that continued migration to Sweden will result in serious gender imbalances. Migrants are also lying about their ages in order to scam off of Sweden’s overly-generous welfare system. All of this goes unaddressed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sweden has received more asylum applications per capita than any other country in Europe – 163,000 last year. The country’s population is just 9.7 million.</p>
<p>What is surprising is that if you look at the breakdown of the ages of applicants in Sweden, there’s a huge bump in the figures at the age of 16 – often unaccompanied minors arriving without a parent or guardian.</p>
<p>And 92% of unaccompanied minors aged 16 and 17 years old are male. So why is this?</p>
<p>“If you’re underage, first of all, you get housing, you get more financial resources. You also have a lot of staff around you helping you with different issues,” says Hanif Bali, a member of the opposition Moderate Party in the Swedish parliament – which is on the centre right of the political spectrum. “If you need food, clothing, everything, you can go to the municipality and demand this money.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I have no sympathy for them. If you want to be the leader, you’d better be able to lead. If not, you should have the decency to step aside. Or you will be forced to step aside. Things can change very quickly.</p>
<p>In Germany in 1920, rightist army officers and conservatives came within an ace of overthrowing the Weimar government in an interesting little event called the Kapp Putsch. Wolfgang Kapp was a 62-year old nationalist who felt that only a coup could save the country from chaos and disaster. In Berlin, the government was actually forced to flee the city.</p>
<div id="attachment_79140" style="width: 280px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-79140 " src="wp-content/uploads/2016/01/narrative3.jpg" alt="narrative3" width="270" height="372"><p class="wp-caption-text">Wolfgang Kapp: he came within an ace of overthrowing the cucks in 1920</p>
</div>
<p>We can’t be sure that Kapp was wrong. Maybe if he had succeeded, things would not have gotten so bad in Germany that even more extreme voices would be listened to. If you block people from expressing themselves, if you marginalize people, very bad things will happen.</p>
<p>In any case, there is a feeling of change in the air. Either Europe will deal with its economic and political issues to the satisfaction of its citizens, or it will not. My guess is that Europe will, sooner or later, revert back to the old nation-state system. The peoples, the cultures, and the heritages are just too different. Not even the cucks running the show can destroy that, as much as they would like to.</p>
<p>And if the EU collapses, it will not be the end of the world. For most of its history, Europe was a collection of nation-states. The elites will lose some money, to be sure. And this is why they are trying to make their loss into our loss. It is not. Nationalism is the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>But their day of reckoning will come. They sold out an entire generation. They plundered, lied, and cowered under their desks when they should have been leading and knocking heads. You sold us out. And you need to pay the price.</p>
