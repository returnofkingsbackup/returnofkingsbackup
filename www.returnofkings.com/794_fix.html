<p>Check out this email I received:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last week I went out on a second date with a gorgeous 20 yr old. She is a college student in the town that I live in. I met her at a coffee shop and have slowly created a rapport with her over the last few months. She is close friends with another young girl I used to sleep with. After awhile I texted the other girl I used to have relations with and asked her for the new girls number.</p>
<p>We went out on a first date, it was nice, I had a pleasant time and we parted ways. We didn’t speak all week and I asked her out on a second date. We went out and had a great time. All was well until I ended up getting pulled over on our way home for failure to stop at a stop sign and ended up getting a DUI. I got arrested right in front of this girl. This is my first offense of any kind, as I am an upstanding citizen. I was placed into the sheriff’s car and hauled away. My 20yr old date was left along with the second officer.</p>

<p>As I sat in jail, after having my younger sister bail me out via bail bond 2 states away. I was told there was a young women waiting for me outside. Abby, my date was there. She stayed and ended driving me home. What a great girl. She drove me home and within 15 minutes I was inside of her. She was one of the most amazing lays of my life and I have had quite a few.</p>
<p>I was amazed at this. Here is a guy, she barely knows, getting arrested on her second date and she lays the hell out of me after picking me up from jail.</p>
<p>It’s a fun story and one that highlights the paradox of the female species.</p>
<p>Cheers to the Zen like state of game beyond game. The biggest disservice anyone could do is get married before they are 40. I find that men just keep getting better with age. Getting married before 30 is Jordan retiring after his rookie year.</p>

<p>The game canon continues to grow. Now we can add “go to jail game” to our list of effective tactics.</p>
