<p><strong>Q: “Are you a rapist?”</strong></p>
<p>No. I’ve never been accused or charged with rape by a single woman. My macho sex writing has been grossly taken out of context by feminists and SJWs. I may be a chauvinist, but I’m not a rapist. <em>See: <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-accusation-that-im-a-rapist-is-a-malicious-lie">The Accusation That I’m A Rapist Is A Malicious Lie</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: “Why do you want to legalize rape?”</strong></p>
<p>I don’t. Legalizing rape is a notion so insanely absurd I never imagined that people would take it 100% seriously, including politicians. I don’t believe any form of physical violence against men or women should be legalized. I’ve said that “How To Stop Rape” was a satirical thought experiment so many times that it’s clear to me current misinterpretation of it by the media is deliberate.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Why do you want to teach guys how to rape?”</strong></p>
<p>I teach guys how to be sexually attractive. This includes being confident and masculine, traits that women <em>say</em> they don’t love, but respond favorably to anyway. There is not a single known case of one of my supporters being involved in a crime that has been linked to my writing. If there was, the media would certainly report on it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “I still hate your fucking guts.”</strong></p>
<p>Instead of focusing your anger on real problems in your neighborhood, city, and country, the media has made you emotional against a man who poses absolutely no threat to anyone. I’m being used as a target so that you can expend your rage on me instead of other entities that are genuinely hurting your standard of living.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Are you ashamed of writing that article?”</strong></p>
<p>More lament than shame. I haven’t messed around with rape topics since that article was written a year ago because people absolutely lose their minds when it comes to rape. Objectively, as a writer, that article was a raging success, a once-in-a-lifetime perfect storm. Writers can only dream of getting that kind of exposure. Realistically, I am disappointed at the flood of negative attention that will now put me in the “rape proponent” box for the rest of my life. I’ll have to tell my future kids one day that daddy is not actually a rapist.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “You’re lying! You were serious!”</strong></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<p>A man right now can claim he’s a woman and everyone is supposed to immediately call him a “she,” even though he’s still biologically male, but when another man claims that an article that came from his brain using his own words had a certain intention, he’s a “liar.” People will believe what satisfies their existing world view.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Mate if you come to my city I’m going to kill you.”</strong></p>
<p>I have noticed that the cities and countries that are most eager to ban or threaten me are ones that I’ve long advised heterosexual men to escape from (Canada, UK, Australia).</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Are you a real life troll or not?”</strong></p>
<p>I was given a gift to be interesting and sensational. I can wrap subtle truths in packaging that gets massive attention. I don’t do it on purpose—it just comes out naturally in my personality and writing. It’s not something I can just turn off.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Are you a pick up artist?”</strong></p>
<p>I started my writing career with pickup. My current work features it much less so I don’t presently identify as a “PUA,” though I stand by my older work.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Are you a men’s rights activist?”</strong></p>
<p>No, but I sympathize with their views. I would call myself a neomasculinist.</p>
<p><strong>Q: “Well I don’t think you’re actually pro rape, so what’s your platform neomasculinity about?”</strong></p>
<p>It’s simply the ideas of traditional masculinity combined with modern truths of the world, including the truth that the mainstream establishment is actively marginalizing heterosexual men. You can read details about neomasculinity at “<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-neomasculinity">What Is Neomasculinity?</a>”</p>
<p>The ideas in that document contain my true beliefs.</p>
