<p>The latest edition of Washington Posts’ Date Lab <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/date-lab-its-like-that-one-with-that-girl-and-the-bro-bro/2012/11/14/5227fbca-2723-11e2-9972-71bf64ea091c_story.html">featured a woman</a> with perhaps the worst attitude I’ve seen. She insults her blind date right from the beginning:</p>
<blockquote><p>I got [to the restaurant at] about 10 of. They said that he had called ahead and he’d be running late. My first impression was just: a nice, handsome guy, a typical D.C. guy, like he left Farragut North-land to go to dinner. <strong>Your typical D.C. bro-bro. That’s what I call them: bro-bros. They’re like a LAX[lacrosse]-bro, but not; now they have, like, real jobs, they have to look the part, but kinda goofy, like they don’t know what’s going on, but they do, a little bit.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>She deems herself witty:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was difficult; like, what do we have in common? And then I was like, “Have you seen ‘Seinfeld’?” I judge a lot of people off of that; you can read a person. <strong>I was shocked to learn that there’s someone else out there that is witty like me</strong>, who doesn’t care and just does that.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also hits us with some wisdom:</p>
<blockquote><p> A blind date is great in theory, but the problem is that it’s just like meeting a complete stranger.</p></blockquote>
<p>:monkey:</p>
<p>She even drops a reference to <em>Sex and the City</em>. All that was more than enough ammunition for guys  on the forum to <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-18059.html">air their views</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> What a banal bitch. Typical middle class urban woman; thinks she’s much smarter and wittier than she is, thinks she’s cultured because she watches TV, total sense of entitlement gleaned from chick TV(actually mentions Sex and the City) and magazines and has nothing to offer a man.</p>

</div>
<p>Is a 4 who looks older than she is. Probably has occasional dates with betas, but mostly sits home watching Lifetime and diddling herself with her sex toy collection. Any doofus who marries her is going to regret it.</p>
<p>The guy laid a pretty good smackdown: David: Her personality didn’t engage mine whatsoever. I didn’t find myself being compelled to find out more about her. She talked a lot about, like, movies and TV shows, and [it was] not an interesting conversation to me. I think, in that sense, we didn’t connect on any level. The whole thing was pretty superficial.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Maybe I’m starting to become enlightened, or maybe it’s just the realization that women aren’t as complex as I once thought. That woman is slowly coming to the conclusion that her alpha-male disguised as a white knight may never show up. And she’s bitter about that. She’s had dates in the past with guys she really liked at first, only to realize a month later that they weren’t who she thought/hoped they were. Again, she’s bitter about this. She’s watched Sex And The City religiously and believes that Sarah Jessica Parker was spot on in her assessment about men at large. And most importantly, that woman realizes she may not be as desirable now as she was in High School or even College when there was always a beta nearby to kick around until Mr. White Knight showed up on his fucking horse. She’s full of realization, and she’s bitter about it.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering how she looks, here you go…</p>

<p>Imagine a city of hundreds of Caitlin’ running around, thinking they’re witty and awesome, and you have Washington DC.</p>
