<p>A great many guys who are newly single or otherwise looking to meet attractive women for dating and relationships bemoan the difficulty of doing so in clubs and bars while barely considering the fact that there is another workable—and some would say superior—method readily available to all. That method is called day game. If you’re not aware of it, or if you are aware but you’re not using it then this is definitely something you should consider, as consistent use of day game could see your experiences with girls improve significantly.</p>
<h3>What Is Day Game?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-81294" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hot-street-girl-667x445-300x200.jpg" alt="hot-street-girl--667x445" width="449" height="299" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hot-street-girl-667x445-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hot-street-girl-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hot-street-girl-667x445-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/hot-street-girl-667x445-574x383.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px"></p>
<p>Day game, as the name suggests, is simply approaching and meeting girls in the day instead of at night. Imagine you simply see a girl you like waiting for a train, having a coffee in Starbucks, or reading a book in the park. You walk up to her and after a few minutes conversation, you take her phone number. Sounds good, right? Well let me tell you, it is.</p>
<p>Day game can take place in any public location that isn’t a bar or a club. So you have at your disposal all of the following: streets, shopping malls, parks, cafes, rail stations, subway platforms and cars, sporting events, book stores, libraries, events and conventions—the list really is endless.</p>
<h3>Benefits Over Nightgame</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-81295" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fba5a7715bb214ea8accb951f71942d2-300x453.jpg" alt="fba5a7715bb214ea8accb951f71942d2" width="278" height="419" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fba5a7715bb214ea8accb951f71942d2-300x453.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fba5a7715bb214ea8accb951f71942d2-262x395.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fba5a7715bb214ea8accb951f71942d2.jpg 477w" sizes="(max-width: 278px) 100vw, 278px"></p>
<p>Now, I’m not suggesting for one moment that it’s as easy as just walking up to a hot girl and just asking for her number—there are tried and tested techniques that I will be writing about over the coming weeks that are likely to make your approach more successful, but of course success every time is never guaranteed. Still, the benefits of daytime approaching really are legion.</p>
<p>Rather than battling to be heard against pumping EDM in the club, facing obstacles <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/78848/why-the-era-of-meeting-girls-in-nightclubs-is-coming-to-an-end">like cockblocking from her friends or from other guys</a>, as well as having to pay for cover charges and expensive drinks, day game is a relatively relaxed affair. An afternoon stroll around your nearest city centre or shopping mall could easily yield ten phone numbers or more. Plus, you can incorporate it into your daily routine. For example, if you commute to work then you could easily take the opportunity to speak to one or two girls on your way there and back. Also, not many other men have the balls to do it.</p>
<p>I first got into day game in London in around 2005, before anyone else in the city was doing it, pretty much (London was later to become awash with day gamers of varying ability). My earlier field reports, posted on a “seduction community” forum in February 2006 (exactly a decade ago) recount how I met a Russian tourist on the subway and went on to have sex with her in her hotel the same night, and how I met someone called HBFashionGirl in a clothes stores, took her contact details and later went on to date her. I also met a long term girlfriend at a bus stop around that same time. She hadn’t given me a second glance before I spoke to her, proving that he who takes a risk in life is often likely to be rewarded for it.</p>
<p>I still remember the feeling of excitement and freedom that this new experience of day gaming gave me. Suddenly, the rules as I knew them were overturned. No longer did I have to turn away regretfully when I saw a beautiful girl in the street, and nor did I have to wait for Friday night at the club before approaching and talking to hot girls. I had given myself permission to talk to any woman I wanted to (within reason) and now the dating world was my oyster.</p>

</div>
<p>Since then I have met and dated women I have met in all sorts of daytime situations from public transport, to high class shopping malls to coffee shops, public events and more.</p>
<h3>Expectations</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-81296" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/b4e4f3dc7ecb4b990d8ee79aabd8cddf.jpg" alt="b4e4f3dc7ecb4b990d8ee79aabd8cddf" width="296" height="444"></p>
<p>It is at this point that I am duty bound to manage your expectations. Yes, there is a smorgasbord of attractive young women out there and a surprising number of them will be friendly and receptive if you approach them confidently in the daytime. Does that mean that they will all be attracted to you, that you will “get” every one?</p>
<p>No, of course it doesn’t.</p>
<p>While it would be inaccurate to call day game a numbers game (with application and experience your results can and will improve) nevertheless, the stark truth is that you will experience more rejections than you do successes. This is just the nature of life. Nothing that is worth doing is easy.</p>
<p>That said, you shouldn’t let the fear of rejection put you off from trying, because rejection itself is not really that bad. Put out of your mind any thought of girls slapping you round the face or calling the police. Such events are outliers and are so uncommon that they’re really not worth worrying about. A more typical rejection will simply be a girl telling you she has a boyfriend.</p>
<p>That’s it.</p>
<p>Now, whether she really has boyfriend or not is another matter. Many girls do, of course, while others are using it as an excuse. You can persist a little after she drops the boyfriend line, but if she maintains her stance then simply smile, wish her a great day and walk off.</p>
<p>In fact, in many cases this can be win-win. The girl walks away happy that she has been complimented, while you leave glad that you’ve made her day, knowing exactly where you stand and ready to approach the next, hopefully more receptive girl.</p>
<p>Remember: not every girl is going to like you. Most won’t be attracted to you. Some will be lukewarm but receptive to a little persuasion (or “game”). A few will be attracted to you off the bat. Your job while doing day game is to find these two latter sets of girls, and the way to do that is to get used to approaching girls all the time in your daily life.</p>
<h3>Skillset</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-81297" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/s2t-girl-Kaylee-Marie-002-300x180.jpg" alt="s2t-girl-Kaylee-Marie-002" width="448" height="269" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/s2t-girl-Kaylee-Marie-002-300x180.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/s2t-girl-Kaylee-Marie-002-262x157.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/s2t-girl-Kaylee-Marie-002.jpg 490w" sizes="(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px"></p>
<p>The most important skill that you need to make day game work for you is persistence, coupled with an imperviousness to rejection. This latter trait you can develop over time through application and repeated action. Next week I will be writing more on day game, this time getting down to tactics—exactly what you should say to that cute girl when you walk up to her in the cafe for the first time.</p>
