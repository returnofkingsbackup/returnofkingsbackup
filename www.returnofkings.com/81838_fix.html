<p class="c8"><span class="c0">Hey man,</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">My name is Jonny Catanzano and I’ve been a National Physique Competitor for the last 4 years. I’m also the lead trainer on the most subscribed fitness channel on YouTube.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">Throughout my years of training, I’ve definitely picked up on a trick or two when it comes to shedding body fat and building pure, ripped muscles.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">And one of the biggest things that I’ve learned about keeping your body fat percentage as low as possible, is that you have to control your master fat loss hormone, leptin.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">Leptin tells your body to burn more fat. When you have a lot of it… you burn a lot of fat, and when you have low leptin levels (or you only have a little bit of it…) you burn little to no fat. </span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">You probably have low leptin levels right now and don’t even realize it; I certainly did.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">And if you are unsure if your leptin levels are high or low, then simply try this out. I call it…</span></p>
<h3 class="c8"><span class="c1">The Belly Fat Test (Takes 6 seconds):</span></h3>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">This is something I have all my personal clients do and is a very important part of how you’ll be able to get rid of that belly fat. I want you to open up both of your hands, reach down and slip your fingers just right under the belly fat that hanging over the waistline of your pants.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">Go ahead…</span></p>
<p class="c8"><img class="alignnone wp-image-81843" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04-300x150.png" alt="image04" width="384" height="192" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04-300x150.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04-768x385.png 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04-837x419.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04-667x334.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04-262x131.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04-574x288.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image04.png 854w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px"></p>

<p class="c8"><span class="c0">Now with your thumb squeeze down gently… give it a firm squeeze.</span></p>
<p class="c8"><img class="alignnone wp-image-81840" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image01-300x157.png" alt="image01" width="382" height="200" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image01-300x157.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image01-768x402.png 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image01-667x349.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image01-262x137.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image01-574x300.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/02/image01.png 820w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px"></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">You did it, right?</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">Now like most guys that I have helped, you’re probably holding onto something that’s been bothering you for a while. You may even be a bit shocked to notice that there’s quite a bit more belly fat than you expected…</span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">But you’re not the only one, because just like you, the majority of all men are carrying around this same kind of belly fat that’s taking over their stomach area. </span></p>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">And if you’re holding onto this belly fat, more than likely… you have pretty low leptin levels, but it’s not your fault. </span></p>
<h3 class="c8"><span class="c1">Here are some of the causes of low Leptin:<br>
</span></h3>
<ul>
<li class="c8"><span class="c0">Stress </span></li>
<li class="c8"><span class="c0">Lack Of Sleep</span></li>
<li class="c8"><span class="c0">Carbs </span></li>
<li class="c8"><span class="c0">Eating Too Much</span></li>
<li class="c8"><span class="c0">Exercising Too Hard  </span></li>
<li class="c8"><span class="c0">High Levels Of Insulin (set off by sugars/starches) </span></li>
</ul>
<p class="c8"><span class="c0">So the bottom line is if you want to burn the most amount of fat, you want your leptin levels to be high.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">So what exactly is leptin and why should you care about it if you want to burn fat, get ripped six pack abs, and not have to worry about shedding the MAX amount of stubborn fat? </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">Well, first of all this powerful hormone is the <a href="http://go2.sixpackshortcuts.com/SH1LG?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">#1 most important fat burning hormone. </a></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">And you have probably heard of another hormone named insulin that is responsible for fat gain—or as the “flab king” that packs on extra pounds. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">But how are the two related? Well, they are actually complete opposites. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">You see, insulin is released in your body when you eat food, particularly ones that are high in sugar… and insulin turns that food into fat. On the other hand, leptin allows your body to actually use energy from the fat you already have on your body.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">You starting to see the difference? </span></p>
<h3 class="c4">
<span class="c1 c2">Now here comes the good par</span><span class="c1">t, well kind of…</span>
</h3>
<p class="c4"><span class="c1">T</span><span class="c0 c2">he more fat you have on your body, the more leptin that will be available so you can burn off that fat. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">However, as you begin to burn off fat, your leptin decreases… so it becomes harder to burn off unwanted body fat and you start storing more fat as your leptin levels decrease. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">Bottom line: as you lose more fat, your leptin goes down and makes it more difficult for you to shed the fat. On top of that, lower leptin levels also make you feel sluggish and unmotivated—or lazy. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">So if you’ve started seeing slower results with your workouts, been feeling sluggish, held a lot of fat in your hands on the belly fat test, or suffer from a bad diet, low leptin levels could be the reason. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">That means you can start burning fat today by taking control of your </span><span class="c0 c2"><a href="http://go2.sixpackshortcuts.com/SH1LG?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">#1 master fat loss hormone.</a></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">Now, I say suffering from a bad diet, because it’s very, very hard to maintain a perfect diet. And dieting is hard… trust me. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">When I compete, I have to stay on a very strict diet, and I still have a hard time keeping my body fat percentage down. That’s why I <a href="http://go2.sixpackshortcuts.com/SH1LG?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">do this 2x daily to accelerate fat loss.</a></span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">So if you have been dieting but not seeing results fast enough—it could simply be because your leptin levels are too low. </span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">And like I just said, leptin becomes even more of an issue when you stop losing fat even though you are dieting and exercising on a regular basis… and it’s just because these levels are too low.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">However, this </span><span class="c0 c2"><a href="http://go2.sixpackshortcuts.com/SH1LG?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">2x Daily For Accelerated Fat Loss</a></span><span class="c0 c2"> technique reignites your leptin and kick your body back into fat burning mode in no time.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">So if you have hit a wall and you’re ready to kick your fat loss into high gear… and you have been doing everything you can to lose fat. </span><span class="c0 c2"><a href="http://go2.sixpackshortcuts.com/SH1LG?utm_source=ROK&amp;utm_campaign=sponsoredpost" rel="nofollow">THIS</a></span><span class="c0 c2"> could put you back on track to getting the body you want.</span></p>
<p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">Shed the fat,</span></p>
