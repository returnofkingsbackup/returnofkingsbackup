<p>The Danish TV channel TV2 has aired a two-part <a href="http://nyheder.tv2.dk/samfund/2016-02-28-tv-2-afsloerer-dansk-imam-underviser-muslimer-om-stening-og-pisk" target="_blank">documentary</a> called “The mosques behind the veil.” Reporters go undercover as Muslims who just arrived in Denmark, and use hidden cameras to expose how Danish imams say one thing to the media and another thing to their devoted mosque-goers.</p>
<p>One imam at the <span data-reactid=".gobizmrwn4.3.$main.0.4.1">Grimhøjvej</span> mosque in Aarhus, Abu Bilal, preaches that adulterous Muslim women should be either stoned to death or whipped, according to Sharia law. The imam also says that leaving the faith or denying any of the religious rules is punishable by death.</p>
<blockquote><p><span id="result_box" class="" lang="en" tabindex="-1"><span class="hps">Anyone who</span> <span class="hps">withdraws from </span><span class="hps">the</span> <span class="hps">religion</span><span class="">, who is</span> <span class="hps">an apostate</span>, <span class="hps">he</span> <span class="hps">must</span> <span class="hps">be killed</span>. <span class="hps">Or</span> <span class="hps">a denial</span>. <span class="hps">One</span> <span class="hps">who denies</span> <span class="hps">fasting</span> <span class="hps">or</span> do <span class="hps">not believe in</span> <span class="hps">fasting</span>. <span class="hps">His</span> <span class="hps">verdict </span><span class="hps">is that he</span> <span class="hps">is</span> a <span class="hps">disbeliever.</span> <span class="hps">If he</span> <span class="hps">is</span> <span class="hps">stubborn and</span> <span class="hps">will not</span> <span class="hps">fast</span>, <span class="hps">he will be killed</span><span class="">.</span></span></p></blockquote>
<h3>“I hope that ISIS wins”</h3>
<p>The hidden camera captures him lecturing women and children about Islamic law and how it should be applied in an ideal Islamic state. He says that the “eye for an eye” rule should be applied to those who hurt Muslims: “If you kill a Muslim, you shall also be killed.”</p>
<p>Abu Bilal’s teachings depart from the mosque’s official line. The chairman, <span id="result_box" class="" lang="sv"><span class="hps">Oussama</span> <span class="hps">El</span><span class="atn">–</span><span class="">Saadi</span></span>, says in an interview that they follow Danish laws and encourage Muslims to take an active part in society: “We can accept everything that is happening around us, and we can cooperate with the people of this country without problems.”</p>
<p>But this is not the first time that the <span data-reactid=".gobizmrwn4.3.$main.0.4.1">Grimhøjvej</span> mosque has been in the media spotlight. For several years it’s been known as a place where young Muslims become radicalized. On Danish radio, Oussama El-Saadi has shown sympathy for the terror organization ISIS: “I hope that ISIS wins, and that one day we have an Islamic state in the world.”</p>

<p>Professor Thomas Hoffmann studies Islam and the Quran at the university of Copenhagen. According to him, imam Abu Bilal was expressing what a “perfect” Islamic justice system looks like. There is a duality in the imam’s view of stoning—the penalty is not allowed today, but might be in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>On the one hand the imam admits that stoning is not a part of this society’s law. But in his view, stoning should be allowed in the best of worlds—the Islamic world. The penalty of stoning points on the one hand back to an ideal judicial norm of Muhammad’s era, but on the other hand it is also postponed to an unspecified Islamic future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thomas Hoffmann thinks that teaching Sharia law makes the integration of Muslim women into Danish society more difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is helping to create a distance and alienation in relation to Danish democratic values and notions of crime and punishment. It probably also contributes to the idea that the Danish society effectively prevents the “true” Islam to unfold.</p>

One imam tells the woman to just trust in God, and that going to the police will only make things worse.</p>
<blockquote><p>I will give you one advice: Don’t go to the Danes. If you can not live with him, then come to the Sharia council. Then it may dissolve the marriage.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Extremists survive by lying</h3>

<p>Danish TV has done a great job of showing just what is being taught in mosques in the West. While people are not currently being stoned in the streets of Denmark, this foreshadows what Western societies might look like in the future, if Muslims come into power. It might seem like a terrifying dystopia to us, having people killed over their religious preferences, but to Muslims it’s paradise on Earth.</p>
<p>Of course not all Muslims have the same opinion on these issues. But it’s not just their crazy ideas that are troubling, it’s the way they lie. How can we know if these ideas are widespread or only true for a small minority, if Muslims aren’t openly talking about them? They obviously say one thing behind closed doors to their trusted peers, and another thing to the media and ethnic Danes. It’s a deceitful act, and it shows their ungratefulness to the people that let them in. It’s also an established custom of Islam.</p>
<p>Taqiya is, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taqiya" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, “a form of Islamic dissimulation or a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are in fear or at risk of significant persecution.” This means that Muslims are allowed to conceal their true opinions and goals in order to protect themselves. A companion of Muhammad, Abu Darda, said “we smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them.”</p>

<p>Lying is a Muslim survival tactic as old as the religion itself. Now we see it practiced in Western countries. It may be the case that Muslims fear that showing their true colors will lead to bad consequences for them. After all, they are still a minority, and they must be aware of how immigration and multiculturalism is being questioned now much more overtly than before. The narrative that made it possible for them to come here in the first place is crumbling under the weight of an unprecedented migration wave.</p>
<p>By nature I’m quite pessimistic, and I don’t see this situation getting better. We now have hundreds of thousands of Muslims in Europe, ready to be radicalized, and more are on their way. ISIS can find many allies among them, and behind the closed doors of the mosques their savage message can spread. After the terrorist attacks in Paris, some asylum seekers could be heard <a href="http://www.svd.se/nar-konflikterna-foljer-med/av/nuri-kino" target="_blank">celebrating</a> in their tax-funded Swedish home.</p>
<p>It’s a ticking bomb just waiting for someone to lit the fuse.</p>
