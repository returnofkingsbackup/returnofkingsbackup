<p>With Donald Trump <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/us/politics/primary-elections-highlights.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news">having won huge victories in four out of the five state primaries on Tuesday</a>—<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/03/15/trump-starts-tuesday-win-mariana-islands/81800628/">as well as in the Northern Marianas Islands</a>—cucks and leftists nationwide are resigning themselves to him being the Republican nominee. The scale of Trump’s triumph is such that he knocked Marco Rubio, last great hope of the GOP establishment, out of the race entirely, and also scored wins against Ted Cruz in Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The only state he lost is Ohio, home of John Kasich, who has limped along as a nonthreatening, bland, safe choice for GOP voters skittish about the comparatively politically inexperienced Trump, Cruz and Rubio.</p>
<p>But how big of an impact did Friday night’s anti-Trump riot in Chicago have on the final vote?</p>
<p>As everyone knows by this point, Trump was forced to cancel a rally at the UIC Pavilion in Chicago last Friday after Bernie Sanders supporters, organized by <em>MoveOn.org</em> and #BlackLivesMatter, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/politics/donald-trump-chicago-protests/">infiltrated the venue and tried to incite a riot</a>. The media attempted to blame Trump for the anarchy, claiming that he was “inciting violence” through his speeches and actions; however, <a href="http://mattforney.com/illinois-campaign-dispatch-part-3/">video recorded by myself and other witnesses at the Chicago event show that all the violence at the rally was incited by left-wing agitators</a>.</p>
<p>By cancelling his Chicago rally, Trump made a strategic retreat in search of a larger prize: votes. By showing the anarchy and violence sown by his haters—and the spineless responses of his competitors for the GOP nomination—Trump was able to secure wins in Illinois and other states that voted on Tuesday. The momentum from those wins will carry him all the way to the nomination, and all it took was one riot.</p>
<h3>The Optics Of The Chicago Riot</h3>

<p>Prior to Friday night’s riot, Trump was in a tight fight for Tuesday’s races, with Florida being the only state where he had a guaranteed win. In Illinois, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/il/illinois_republican_presidential_primary-4251.html">polling showed Trump with only narrow leads over Cruz and Kasich</a>, and <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/oh/ohio_republican_presidential_primary-4077.html">he had actually fallen behind the latter in Ohio</a>. Additionally, Illinois’ deliberately Byzantine primary structure—requiring that voters vote not just for candidates, but for their delegates in each Congressional district as well—left Trump little room for error.</p>

<p>Both Kasich and Cruz made serious bids for Illinois; last week, I attended both a Kasich town hall and a Heidi Cruz meet and greet in Chicago’s suburbs, which I documented <a href="http://mattforney.com/illinois-campaign-dispatch-part-2/">here</a>. Kasich had built up a base of support among Chicago’s moderate voters, while Cruz targeted more conservative, Christian voters downstate.</p>
<p>The anti-Trump riot changed all that. In the span of two hours, Trump positioned himself as the enemy of #BlackLivesMatter and every left-wing agitator group in Chicago, widely despised by average Illinois voters. Additionally, Ted Cruz and the other GOP candidates sided with the rioters against Trump, <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/03/11/opportunist-ted-cruz-donald-trump-is-responsible-for-organized-chicago-violence-video/">which precipitated a massive revolt among their supporters</a>. In particular, the sight of a “Constitutionalist” like Cruz backing a mob that had deprived Trump of his First Amendment rights disgusted his remaining fans.</p>
<p>The numbers don’t lie: on Tuesday, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/illinois">Trump outperformed polls to win Illinois by a nine-point margin</a>, helped by his landslide victories in Chicago and its suburbs. In Cook County, home of the city itself, he won with a 16-point margin over John Kasich. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/florida">Trump also won Florida in a landslide</a>, with a 19-point margin of victory over Rubio (remarkable considering that Florida is Rubio’s home state), and also edged out Cruz in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/north-carolina">North Carolina</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/missouri">Missouri</a>. Even in Ohio, where he lost, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/ohio">he held Kasich to a narrow 11-point victory</a>.</p>
<h3>All Berned Out</h3>

<p>On the Democratic side, the quasi-communist revolution instigated by Bernie Sanders is all but out of gas. <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-bernie-sanders-220844?lo=ap_e2">Hillary Clinton crushed Sanders on Tuesday night</a>, winning every single race up for grabs. While Sanders was able to keep her margins narrow in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/illinois">Illinois</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/missouri">Missouri</a>, his persistent inability to appeal to minority voters has left him gasping for air in a party that is now primarily nonwhite. Perhaps his supporters should spend less time inciting violence at Trump rallies and more time getting the vote out.</p>
<p>It’s clear by this point that Hillary is going to get the Democratic nomination, with both the primary voters and the party machinery operating in her favor. She’ll be at a <em>massive</em> disadvantage in the general election due to Trump’s popularity, his persuasiveness and her massive amounts of baggage, but she’s not going to go down without a fight.</p>
