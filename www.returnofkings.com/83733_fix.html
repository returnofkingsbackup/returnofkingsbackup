<p>Of all the 2016 presidential candidates, both Republican and Democrat, the worst one by far is Hillary Clinton. If she is elected to the presidency, her policies may bring an end to the United States as we know it. Here’s why.</p>
<h3>Stacking the Supreme Court with liberals</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83743" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gay-pride_s345x230-300x200.jpg" alt="gay-pride_s345x230" width="300" height="200" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gay-pride_s345x230-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gay-pride_s345x230-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/gay-pride_s345x230.jpg 345w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>The most devastating effect of a President Hillary would be on the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Assuming that Senate Republicans have the fortitude to delay a vote on President Obama’s Court appointment, the next president will be responsible for choosing the next four or five Supreme Court justices. By nominating younger justices, it is not an exaggeration to say that the next president will set the direction of the Court for the next 30 years.</p>
<p>We have to face a cold, hard fact here: Supreme Court justices who were nominated by Democrat presidents unswervingly vote in a liberal way. They never, never, never deviate from their mandate to always decide in favor of progressive social engineering.</p>
<p>Republican nominees have a much less consistent record. Justice Kennedy, who was appointed by President Reagan, has the reputation of being the swing vote on liberal social justice cases. It was Kennedy who provided the majority vote in the <em>Obergefell</em> decision that legalized <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75203/why-homosexual-marriage-matters-for-straight-men">same-sex marriage</a>. Chief Justice Roberts, who was nominated by President Bush, voted in favor of Obamacare.</p>
<p>Social conservatives are very concerned that stacking the Court with liberal justices will forever enshrine abortion rights and same-sex marriage as the law of the land. They are correct to have this fear. But a greater risk is of what is coming down the pike. We’ve already seen the <a href="http://honoranddaring.com/the-campaign-to-mainstream-pedophilia-has-begun/">opening shots</a> fired in the campaign to make pedophilia mainstream. With a majority liberal Court, the pedophiles will be able to achieve in eight years what it took gays decades to achieve.</p>
<p>As terrible as the social engineering will be, the next change will be even worse.</p>
<h3>Gun Confiscation</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-83734" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-cries-300x138.png" alt="obama-cries" width="500" height="231" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-cries-300x138.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-cries-262x121.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-cries-574x265.png 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/obama-cries.png 596w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Liberals hate the Second Amendment. It has been their wet dream for decades to take away guns from the law-abiding public. They want to take away your guns so badly that President Obama even cried about it.</p>
<p>There has been one thing that has continuously stymied Democrat efforts to confiscate your guns—the Second Amendment of the Constitution. But liberals view the Constitution as a document that should be interpreted in whatever way is most suitable to the current year. I would not be surprised to see a majority liberal Court decide that the right to bear arms is an outmoded vestige of our colonial past.</p>
<p>Although she has not made it a campaign promise, Hillary has <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/16/hillary-clinton-australia-gun-ban-worth-looking-u-s/">already expressed interest</a> in using Australia’s “gun buyback” method to confiscate guns in the US. As soon as President Hillary is able to get a liberal majority on the Court, expect her to make gun confiscation a top priority.</p>
<p>Hillary’s crusade against guns may be the spark that sets off a revolt in the US as a minority of Americans would rather fight than part with their right to bear arms.</p>
<h3>Immigration</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-83735" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07-san-bernardino-shooters-airport.w529.h529-300x300.jpg" alt="07-san-bernardino-shooters-airport.w529.h529" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07-san-bernardino-shooters-airport.w529.h529-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07-san-bernardino-shooters-airport.w529.h529-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07-san-bernardino-shooters-airport.w529.h529-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/07-san-bernardino-shooters-airport.w529.h529.jpg 529w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>It is really difficult to get more liberal on immigration than most of the Republican candidates. Jeb Bush famously called illegal immigration an “act of love.” And all of the Republican candidates except for Trump call for dramatically increasing legal immigration levels.</p>
<p>Hillary does not disappoint. Even comedian Bill Maher, a flaming liberal, mocked Hillary’s ultra-liberal position:</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been a real change with the Democrats… Mission Creep, I would call it. I understand their position was comprehensive immigration reform. Now, in front of Univision, it seems to have morphed into, “you get across that river, you’re here to stay.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hillary pretends her position on immigration is because she just wants to help poor immigrants, but she says that just to fool stupid voters. There are two real reasons for her favoring wide-open borders.</p>
<p>The first is that she wants to provide her big donors with an abundant supply of cheap labor. Illegals for the low-end and H1B visas for the higher end. Hillary shares this goal in common with the Republican establishment.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>The second is that she wants to ensure her re-election and Democrat hegemony over the US for the future. Recent immigrants vote overwhelmingly Democrat. Obama received 71% of the Hispanic vote and 73% of the Asian vote. By letting in hordes of new immigrants, Hillary will change the US from a center right country into a full tilt, left-wing, multicultural hellhole. And it will stay that way—forever.</p>
<h3>More Feminism</h3>
<div id="attachment_83736" style="width: 410px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-83736" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware-300x456.jpeg" alt="grrlpowerstemware" width="400" height="607" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware-300x456.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware-768x1166.jpeg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware-837x1271.jpeg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware-667x1013.jpeg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware-262x398.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware-574x872.jpeg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/grrlpowerstemware.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Grrl Power renders this young feminist impervious to pain.</p>
</div>
<p>Hillary’s only real qualification for the presidency is that she has a vagina and she slept with Bill Clinton at least once several years ago. Her eight years in the Senate are not marked by any notable achievements, and the defining feature of her tenure as Secretary of State was the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, which left four Americans dead.</p>
<p>For this reason, Hillary has laid great emphasis on the fact that she is a woman. In an interview with <a href="http://time.com/4166539/hillary-clinton-woman-governing-campaigning/">Time magazine</a> she pretty much said that women are better at governing than men:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that there are certain issues that we are more attuned to one of the things that I did in the State Department is increase resources to cases involving child abductions, trying to do more to promote international adoptions where appropriate. I just think there are some areas where our own life experiences really prepare us to be more receptive. I do think there is something in the governing or organizing approach. I just think women in general are better listeners, are more collegial, more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for win-win outcomes. That has been my experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because women comprise one of Hillary’s two large voting blocs, you can bet that she will push feminism and grrrl power at every turn.</p>
<h3>Racial Divisiveness</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-83742" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/n_81554_1-300x199.jpg" alt="n_81554_1" width="500" height="332" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/n_81554_1-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/n_81554_1-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/n_81554_1-574x381.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/n_81554_1.jpg 626w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Blacks comprise the second large voting bloc for Hillary. If you’ve watched the Democratic primaries, blacks are responsible for the fact that Hillary is beating Bernie Sanders. Bernie plays well in states with mostly white populations, but in states that have a large black population, Hillary always wins. That is because blacks vote for Hillary in even larger margins than they voted for Barack Obama.</p>
<p>To keep the black vote in line, Hillary will follow in Obama’s footsteps and continue to fan the fire of racial animus. If Hillary is elected, expect to see many more cities burning down due to race riots. All the while, Hillary will use racial tensions as a wedge to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62790/the-baltimore-riots-where-the-state-is-the-insurgency">encroach on the police power</a> which is supposed to be reserved to the states.</p>
<p>Race relations in the US are a powder keg that is set to explode. Hillary is more than willing to light the match if it assures her a second term.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ve left a lot out. I haven’t mentioned the fact that Hillary is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clinton-Cash-Foreign-Governments-Businesses/dp/0062369288/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458705155&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=hillary+clinton+corrupt">notorious for selling political influence</a>. I haven’t mentioned the email scandal or the fact that Hillary will continue the failed interventionist foreign policy of the Bush and Obama Administrations. To give every reason why Hillary would make a terrible president, I would need several volumes.</p>
<p><iframe width="1200" height="675" src="../www.youtube.com/embed/kypl1MYuKDY%3Ffeature=oembed.html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>After 16 years of cynical and inept leadership under Bush and Obama, the US has already suffered immeasurable harm. Even with the best leadership, it is doubtful that the US will ever regain its prior glory. The years of open borders, enlargement of the welfare class, and the destruction of the American manufacturing sector have inflicted permanent damage. Eight years of a Hillary regime would only accelerate the process of destruction. Her policies will aggravate every problem area and virtually guarantee that the United States will come apart.</p>
<p>In fact, that may be the only legitimate reason to vote for Hillary. Rather than a long protracted death under someone like a President Kasich, Romney, Ryan, Rubio, or Haley, a Hillary presidency will lay the groundwork for a swift, shocking end. Those of us who remain alive after the shock would then be able to rebuild civilization from the ground up.</p>
<p>As for me, I would prefer to delay the apocalypse for another generation or two.</p>
