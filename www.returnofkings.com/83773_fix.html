<p>With yet another primary day out of the way, Donald Trump has taken another big step towards the Oval Office. Both parties held primary elections in Arizona and Utah this week, with the Democrats holding an additional caucus in Idaho (the Republican primary in that state was held two weeks ago). <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/arizona">Trump cruised to victory in Arizona</a>, but he suffered a larger-than-expected defeat in Utah, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/utah">with winner Ted Cruz netting 69 percent of votes</a> and the Donald languishing in third behind John Kasich.</p>
<p>While it was a foregone conclusion that Trump would lose Utah—<a href="http://newobserveronline.com/naked-mrs-trump-ads-backfire/">his outspoken personality and supermodel wife being an affront to the tweedy, porn-addicted Mormons who inhabit the state</a>—Cruz’s landslide win defies both polling and common sense. Cruz’s support has been limited to Christian conservatives, and even in his home state of Texas, he only got 43 percent of the vote. What explains his 50+ point margin of victory in Utah?</p>
<p>The answer is voter fraud. Much in the same way that Microsoft may have rigged the Iowa caucus to benefit the dearly departed Marco Rubio, <a href="http://www.thepoliticalinsider.com/massive-voter-fraud-tonight-utah-primary/">a George Soros-owned firm may have cooked the books for Ted Cruz in Utah</a>. With the continued success of Trump’s nationalist campaign, power brokers on both the left and right have pulled out all the stops to shut him down.</p>
<h3>Arizona Smart Smart Smart, Utah Very Dumb</h3>

<p>While polls consistently showed Trump lagging behind Cruz in Utah, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ut/utah_republican_presidential_caucus-5765.html">they also consistently showed Cruz failing to break the 50 percent margin</a>, let alone approaching the 69 percent of the vote he actually got. Utah is only a winner-take-all state (i.e. it awards all of its delegates to whoever wins the popular vote) if one of the candidates gets at least 50 percent: below that margin, losing candidates are awarded some delegates. With his landslide victory in the state, Cruz scoops up all of Utah’s delegates.</p>
<p>Because of this, there is a <em>huge</em> incentive for voter fraud in Utah. In the past month, the GOP establishment has openly stated that <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/03/03/final-tripwire-triggered-mitt-romney-admits-gope-globalist-grand-scheme-the-splitter-strategy/">they are trying to force a brokered convention by denying Donald Trump the majority of delegates he needs to clinch the nomination</a>. At this stage in the race, it’s mathematically impossible for either Ted Cruz or John Kasich to win the nomination: there simply aren’t enough delegates in play. However, by continuing to run, Cruz and Kasich can siphon off delegates from Trump, denying him a majority and allowing the GOP to steal the nomination from him in July.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/20/soros-board-member-chairs-firm-running-online-balloting-for-tuesdays-utah-caucuses/">As <em>Breitbart </em>reported earlier this week</a>, Utah’s Republican online caucuses were managed by Smartmatic Group, whose chairman, Lord Mark Malloch-Brown, is on the board of George Soros’ Open Society Foundation. Additionally, <a href="http://rightwingnews.com/top-news/breaking-anti-trump-protesters-admit-hired-craigslist-paid-protest/">the Marxist protesters who attempted to shut down Trump’s rally in Phoenix last weekend were on Soros’ payroll</a>:</p>

<p>Additionally, last week, former Massachusetts governor and failed 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney announced that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/03/18/mitt-romney-to-vote-for-ted-cruz/?_r=0">he would be voting for Ted Cruz in the Utah caucuses</a>. Notably, he did not <em>endorse </em>Cruz, because Romney and the GOP establishment don’t want Cruz to get the nomination; instead, their plan is to install a Wall Street-approved stooge such as Jeb Bush or Romney himself at a brokered convention.</p>
<p>While Soros’ vote fraud and Romney’s machinations may have denied Trump the Utah delegates that he rightly earned, they failed to stop him in neighboring Arizona, where he soared to victory with 47 percent of the vote. Trump’s triumph in Arizona was aided by his tough stance on illegal immigration, which has torn that great state apart, as well as endorsements from popular GOP politicians such as Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and former governor Jan Brewer. Arizona is also a winner-take-all state, meaning that Cruz and Kasich will get no delegates from the state.</p>
<h3>Berning Up</h3>

<p>Tuesday’s primaries also saw a resurgence in support for Bernie Sanders: while he lost the Arizona primary by a significant margin, he won landslide victories in Utah and Idaho, taking close to 80 percent of the vote in each state. This is likely due to the fact that Sanders primarily appeals to white voters, and Utah and Idaho are two of the last remaining states where the Democratic Party is still largely white (because said states themselves are largely white).</p>
<p>While Sanders still remains a long-shot for the Democratic nomination, he’s shown that he has staying power among the white progressives who form the ideological core of his party. However, if he can’t broaden his appeal to the party’s minorities, he will inevitably lose out to Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>The next primaries will be in Wisconsin and New York, and while the latter has already been written off as an easy Trump/Clinton victory, cuckservatives are pouring resources into the former hoping to stall Trump’s momentum. <a href="http://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/03/23/tripwire-alert-the-republican-party-now-admits-they-are-supporting-ted-cruz-so-they-can-lose-to-hillary/">With even Jeb Bush returning to the fray to endorse Ted Cruz</a>, it’s clear that Trump is the only choice for voters hoping to fight back against the globalist monstrosity that George Soros and his ilk represent.</p>
