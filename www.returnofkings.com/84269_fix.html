<p>Assisted reproduction, like artificial insemination, has been an option for couples in Sweden for some time. On Friday, <a href="http://www.expressen.se/halsoliv/ensamstaende-kan-fa-assisterad-befruktning/" target="_blank">a new law</a> came into force that gives single women the same right. Feminist crowds are cheering that voluntary single motherhood will now likely become more common in Sweden.</p>
<p>The facts show that this will undoubtedly make society worse. Poverty and crime are much more common with people growing up in female headed households. This can all be avoided if sperm donors refuse to give their sample to single women, but Sweden is such a “progressive” country that they probably won’t mind it.</p>
<h3>Hundreds will do it every year</h3>
<p>Previously, Swedish women went to other countries to have the treatment done, like Denmark and Finland. Based on the number of women going to these two countries in 2014, the National Board of Health and Welfare predicts that around 800 single women will become artificially impregnated in Sweden yearly.</p>
<p>Like couples, the single woman will first be evaluated by a doctor to see if she’s medically and psychologically fit to go through the procedure. Her “social condition” will also be taken into account. The child will be able to contact the sperm donor when it turns 18.</p>
<p>The two most conservative parties in the parliament voted against passing this new law, and for good reason. It doesn’t require a great stretch of the imagination to think that assisted reproduction will be more common when it becomes more easily available, and women won’t need to go abroad to get it. That means we will soon see an increase in single parent households, and more fatherless children.</p>
<h3>More likely to be poor without a father</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84321" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/singlemom2.jpg" alt="singlemom2" width="500" height="376" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/singlemom2.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/singlemom2-300x226.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/singlemom2-262x197.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Growing up without a dad is not only terrible for the child itself, but also for society as a whole. <a href="http://www.fathers.com/statistics-and-research/the-consequences-of-fatherlessness/" target="_blank">Data shows</a> that fatherless children are more likely to be poor, get involved in drug and alcohol abuse, drop out of school, and suffer from poor physical and emotional health. While boys are more likely to become criminals, girls are more likely to become pregnant as teens. In the US, children living in female headed families are four times more likely to be poor than children with married parents.</p>
<p>It seems like the data indicates that fathers are quite important, yet that’s something our politicians don’t seem to care about. It’s ironic that they now support single women becoming mothers, making it seem like it’s a great step forward, when they’ve been telling men for so long that they have to take more responsibility as fathers. Why, I wonder, has absent dads been talked about as a problem, if women are perfectly capable of raising kids on their own? Maybe that proposition of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/83303/should-men-be-allowed-to-have-an-abortion" target="_blank">legal abortion for men</a> wasn’t such a bad idea after all.</p>

<h3>No one wants Swedish men</h3>
<p>It’s also ironic that this is happening in Sweden, probably the most progressively screwed up country in the world. Here, men are doing everything they can to accommodate the demands of rabid radical feminist women. Women are given welfare, affirmative action, and every other stupid leftist policy you can think of. Yet Swedish women seem less and less interested in having children with Swedish men. But maybe it’s not ironic, maybe it’s just in our nature. Females want males that are strong and dominant, not ones that are easy to push around and control. The more men want the approval of women, the less of it they get. If women don’t want Swedish men anymore, I really can’t blame them.</p>
<p>What bugs me is not just that people make bad decisions in life. You won’t be able to stop that no matter how hard you try to regulate society. It upsets me even more that I’m forced to finance people’s bad decisions. It’s not yet decided if single women themselves have to pay for the procedure to make them pregnant, or if the government will do it for them. But since it’s free of charge for couples, I predict that the treatment for single women will largely be payed for by the taxpayers as well. And that’s not the end of it. The one thing single mothers do well is leech off the welfare system. Working men and women will have to pay the bills when the single mother gets burnt out and quits her job to be a full-time crappy mom.</p>

<h3>Hold sperm donors accountable</h3>
<p>But the true bad guys here are not the stupid women, it’s the men who hand over their sperm to them. Sperm donors will have to consent to having their seed go to single women. If no one concedes to this, single women won’t have any semen to use and this whole thing won’t be an issue at all. But as most Swedish men are white knights, I believe many of them will volunteer to donate their sperm and see it as and act of solidarity with the poor women. Maybe you could argue that donors will profit from it in an evolutionary sense, but they still make society worse for everyone by knowingly and willingly creating fatherless children.</p>
<p>In the end, the real losers in this story are the kids who will grow up without a father, and with a mother who obviously cares little about their well-being. They’ll grow up not knowing where they come from and who they’re made of. Boys and girls won’t have the guidance of a strong father figure, and they’ll make stupid decisions because of it. Girls will have babies in their teens and create a new generation of screwed up youths.</p>
<p>They can thank feminism for ruining their lives before it even started.</p>
