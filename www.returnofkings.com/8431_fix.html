<p>A recent <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-22051.html">thread </a>over on the forum made me think of the most important aspects of masculine development. Here is a list of the 6 most important themes from that thread.</p>
<h4>1. “Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.” — Richard Feynman</h4>
<p>The one thing you can be sure of in life is your own mind. The knowledge you have accumulated will grow and serve its purpose into old age. It is this knowledge which will help you more than instinct. Always be reading and learning from those <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/5375/25-great-quotes-from-german-philosopher-arthur-schopenhauer">more knowledgeable</a> than you. Most people’s minds are sedated by technology and the internet. Everything that has ever been <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/6275/the-landmark-thucydides">written</a> is at your fingertips so go and find something, anything to learn about. Whether it be a new skill, history, philosophy or science, always be learning.</p>
<h4>2. “Game is everything and everything is game” — Tuthmosis</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/category/dating">Game</a> is a mandatory skill for every man. The most successful men you meet will have impeccable social skills. <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-11115.html">Game</a> gives you the ability to make people comfortable and get what you want out of life. Follow the <a href="http://heartiste.wordpress.com/the-sixteen-commandments-of-poon/">16 commandments</a> to a T and always be tweaking your skills. <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-22051-post-401629.html#pid401629">Pussy</a> makes the world go ’round, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/6497/3-game-innovations-youve-never-heard-about">think outside the box</a> and learn to make your own supply. If you want good favors from the poon-gods always have your logistics in check.</p>
<h4>3. “Women. They are a complete mystery” — Steven Hawking</h4>

<p><em>Not if you study game.</em></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<p>Understand the nature of women, what drives them and then you will know how to approach them. The one piece of advice for any man would be to judge women by their actions and not by their words. The same girl that says shes a nice girl who likes a sensitive man will be dripping wet after displays of your masculine dominance. Know that women crave strength and dominance; <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-22051-post-401629.html#pid401629">weakness </a>elicits disgust. In spite of this do not hate women for what they are, <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-19730-post-350015.html#pid350015">understand</a> their nature and appreciate it. Instead of detesting that a woman will base her actions off of emotions (and rationalize them later) use this to your advantage and instill in her the mood you want.</p>
<h4>4. Health Is Your Number One Priority</h4>
<p><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lifting.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8436" alt="lifting" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lifting.jpg" width="486" height="532"></a></p>
<p>Health, like knowledge, is best to create early in life. Being healthy is being free. Start lifting, eat unprocessed foods and experiment with things like juicing. Aside from your physical well-being a healthy body will improve your game.</p>
<h4>5. “Be so bold and daring as to make yourself excruciatingly uncomfortable.” — thedude3737</h4>
<p>Always be pushing yourself to be better. Stagnation is the enemy of progress and without pushing your comfort zone you will never progress. This discomfort will eventually turn into confidence in a given situation and this confidence is the life-blood of self-improvement. Confidence will also allow you to maneuver effortlessly in any aspect of your life leading to improvements in all areas. Douse your fears and success will follow.</p>
<h4>6. Be Completely Unapologetic In Your <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/category/masculinity">Masculinity</a>
</h4>
<p>Do not let the <a href="http://www.rooshvforum.com/thread-22051-post-401622.html#pid401622">‘shit-test’</a> that is modern feminism discourage you from embracing your biology. Do not <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/7183/the-rise-of-straight-shaming-2">apologize</a> for your testosterone. <a href="http://www.jack-donovan.com/axis/books/the-way-of-men/">Read</a> and experience all that is man. Eat steak, drink beer, have sex with feminine women. This being said do not espouse your views because the average person is too <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/www.returnofkings.com/8034/5-ways-to-emasculate-a-man">comfortable </a>in their naive existence. Be the change you want to see and follow the <a href="http://www2.tech.purdue.edu/cgt/courses/cgt411/covey/48_laws_of_power.htm">48 Laws Of Power</a> while you’re at it.</p>
