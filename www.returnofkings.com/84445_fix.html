</div>
<p>A couple years ago, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/author/tuthmosis" target="_blank">Tuthmosis</a> nearly broke the internet with his signature piece, <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/16837/24-signs-shes-a-slut" target="_blank">24 Signs She’s A Slut</a>. About a year later <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/author/matt-forney" target="_blank">Matt Forney</a> came a little closer with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/81129/5-reasons-why-girls-with-tattoos-and-piercings-are-broken" target="_blank">5 Reasons Girls With Tattoos And Piercings Are Broken</a>. Thanks to the publicity those articles generated, countless men started to look at tatted up chicks sporting bullrings in their noses in a different light.</p>
<p>To piggyback off of their momentum I’ve decided to put together a list of slut tells that may not be so obvious to the naked eye—red pill or otherwise. Girls these days have PhDs in “hide my notch count-ology” so if men don’t take a good hard look beneath the surface, they’ll be taken for ride to be sure.</p>
<p>Here are six covert signs the girl you’re looking to run game on is probably a bona fide slut.</p>
<h3>6. She lives alone</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-83509" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cheating-girlfriend-300x200.jpg" alt="cheating-girlfriend" width="462" height="308" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cheating-girlfriend-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cheating-girlfriend-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cheating-girlfriend-574x383.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/04/cheating-girlfriend.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px"></p>
<p>When you see where she lives you might think at first glance “Hmmmm…..she’s got her own spot. Impressive.” But if you’re unplugged, you’ll know this is a major red flag.</p>
<p>The reason is that women are heavily influenced by people who shame them, or question any choice they make be it how they dress, what they do for a living, and most of all how many random hookups they have with random dudes.</p>
<p>Living by herself gives her carte blanche to sleep with as many dudes as her little heart desires without the judgmental gaze of her roommates or relatives. You’ll often find that females who live alone claim they have “no social life” or tell you they had a “quiet weekend.”</p>
<p>If she’s even half decent looking, her claims are probably a lie. With male thirst at an all time high, it’s a pretty good bet that a woman who doesn’t share a residence with another human being is likely pushing triple digits in the notch count category, and it seldom takes long to get there.</p>
<h3>5. Her hobby is an art, but she sucks at it</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="../img.timeinc.net/time/2008/50_states_travel/massachusetts.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="235"></p>
<p>This one is based on my personal experience with sluts. Over the years I’ve noticed that a lot of promiscuous girls I’ve slayed are into drawing, painting, music, dancing, writing, and other forms of “artistic expression.” Thing is, none of them were any good any at them. Sure there were a few that were half decent but by and large they were all well below average.</p>
<p>I’m not a psychologist by any stretch of the imagination, but my guess is that expressing themselves artistically is a way to escape the fact that they can’t keep their legs closed around men. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/68452/i-didnt-think-my-marriage-was-all-that-bad-until-i-found-the-manosphere" target="_blank">The ex-Mrs. Sharpe</a> was into painting when we lived in Florida but she was terrible at it. Of course I told her she was the greatest painter since Leonardo da Vinci (which never got me laid), but the fact of the matter is that she was an atrocious painter.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="../1pointperspective.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/pottery.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="476"></p>
<p>One girl I was seeing told me she wrote “poetry.” I’m no literature aficionado but even I knew her “inner thoughts” were a dumpster fire. It sounded like a cross between amateur hour and show-and-tell in Miss Crabtree’s 4th grade class…I am not exaggerating.</p>
<p>So the next time a chick wants to show you her collection of deformed bowls and vases she makes in her pottery classes, keep in mind that you’ve probably got a whore on your hands.</p>
<h3>4. She is or has worked in a call center</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="../www.magellan-solutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/callcenter09.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="346"></p>
<p>Anyone who’s ever worked in a call center knows that commingling between employees is at least twice as rampant as any other workplace out there. Having managed a few myself I can personally attest to the fact that regardless of position, no one is exempt from the temptation of fucking their coworkers in this environment…<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/68708/how-i-tried-to-turn-a-ho-into-a-housewife" target="_blank">or at least trying</a>.</p>
<p>Girls who either are or have been employed at a call center are usually epic sluts in and outside of the office. Something about this particular work habitat is like an aphrodisiac for both males and females.</p>
<p><strong><em>A classic example of the kind of woman who works in call centers</em></strong></p>
<p>A mid-forties woman at a call center I used to work at whose thousand cock stare (more on this in a bit) was the very first thing I noticed about her, is the quintessential example of a call center slut. She must have told me she was a “good girl” no less than a dozen times in the first two weeks I was there. I never bought her act for a second and verbalized as much and as it turns out, I was right. She had seven children by three different men, was in the middle of a divorce, and was always texting multiple dudes who were trying to fuck her—or likely already were.</p>
<p>Her Facebook page (which was always on her screen at work) was riddled with <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/66094/30-facebook-pictures-that-confirm-red-pill-truths" target="_blank">meme after meme </a>that all basically say “I’ve been with a lot of guys but I’m still an awesome woman who deserves a good man because I say I do,” or something to that effect. Her soon to be ex-husband was a man with a substance abuse problem who “treated her like shit” and “cheated on her all the time.” She used to say “I like nice guys” but she was married to this “douchebag” for nearly 20 years and is the longest relationship she has and ever will be in.</p>
<div style="width: 471px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../img05.deviantart.net/0c61/i/2011/172/e/b/i__m_a_good_girl_by_abhie008-d3jk912.png" alt="" width="461" height="293"><p class="wp-caption-text">Never bought her act for a second.</p>
</div>
<p>The kicker was that one of her coworkers told me that she sometimes leaves her young children alone to go off and see this guy or that. She stopped talking to me altogether after a while. I’m thinking she knew I saw through her thinly veiled “good girl” mask and saw her for the typical aging slut she was, no matter how many ways she tried to snowflake. I could be wrong but I doubt it.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Chicks who work in call centers are easy and it’s as simple as that. Tread carefully with these broads because they’ll start fucking the dude with the highest closing percentage or the biggest bonus without a second thought. I’ve seen this happen in<em> every</em> call center I have ever worked in.</p>
<h3>3. She has the thousand cock stare</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="../manboobz.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/thousand.png%3Fw=604" alt="" width="413" height="366"></p>
<p>This particular slut tell is a little tougher to pick up on. Especially if you’re not a veteran player. This was the look in the aforementioned office slut’s eyes when she first uttered the words “I’m a good girl.” Suffice it to say, her eyes betrayed her feeble attempt at trying to look like a unicorn.</p>
<p>The “thousand cock stare” is loosely defined as the look on a woman’s face that reveals spite, apathy, fatigue, and hopelessness <strong>all at the same time</strong>. This look is a direct result of being drilled and dropped by a shitload of men.</p>
<p>The spite is because she’s pissed off at the world for not having locked down a man because of her slutty ways. The apathy is from being desensitized to sex, an inevitable ramification of taking different cocks for an extended period of time. The fatigue is her being tired of the constant battle to get and keep male attention and having to resort to sexual favors earlier and earlier as she gets older. And the hopelessness comes from her knowing deep down she’ll never have a relationship of consequence with a man she loves and respects, who finds her tolerable outside of sex.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="../i46.tinypic.com/34hvzg4.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="400"></p>
<p>Women over 30, single mothers, and a combination of the two are most likely to have the stare and will be the easiest to spot. Keep in mind that it doesn’t discriminate against the young. Every once in a while I’ll scroll through <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/58132/how-forgetting-my-game-because-of-a-woman-almost-ruined-my-life" target="_blank">Amy’s</a> Facebook page and her TCS cuts through my screen like a hot knife through butter and she’s nearly a half decade from the big 3-0.</p>
<p>Picking up on this tell will take some practice but once you learn to recognize it, it’s easy to spot. The thousand cock stare never lies. Ever.</p>
<h3>2. She works out at a meathead gym</h3>
<div style="width: 664px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../upl.stack.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/He-Obnoxiously-Grunts-or-Screams-STACK.jpg" alt="" width="654" height="368"><p class="wp-caption-text">This is frowned upon in today’s mainstream fitness clubs</p>
</div>
<p>Wannabe gyms that literally cut your balls off when you walk in (like Planet Fitness) isn’t what I’m talking about. I’m talking about the kinds of gyms that have 10 or more squat racks, dudes loudly grunting as they pull 400+ lbs, and openly discussing steroid cycles in the locker room—the kind of gym every man needs to join.</p>
<p>Women who are members of these gyms are usually in the upper aesthetic echelon. They’re in unbelievable shape because they don’t mess around with Nautilus machines or those ridiculous workout balls fat chicks like to bounce on to pretend they’re exercising. They’re squatting and lifting free weights with the fellas and their physiques reflect their hard work.</p>
<div style="width: 450px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../cdn.acidcow.com/pics/20130325/fitness_chicks_are_always_gorgeous_13.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="600"><p class="wp-caption-text">Girls who look like this are likely fucking their spotters</p>
</div>
<p>Add her hard-earned SMV with the fact that she’s surrounded on a daily basis by males who are much more fit and muscular than the average man and that those males have no qualms with exhibiting masculinity around her as they lift heavy weights and it’s only a matter of time before she starts sleeping with a few of them.</p>
<p>If your girl is in great shape and is a member at one of these gyms, chances are she has or is fucking her male spotters.</p>
<h3>1. She’s been married at least once</h3>
<p>A recent conversation with a soon to be divorcée sums this up:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84502 " src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2.png" alt="divorcee2" width="492" height="137" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2.png 1027w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2-300x84.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2-768x214.png 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2-837x233.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2-667x186.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2-262x73.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/divorcee2-574x160.png 574w" sizes="(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px"></p>
<p>Nothing elicits euphoria in today’s woman like separation and subsequent divorce papers. It is quite literally her golden ticket aboard the Cock Carousel Express and it takes them very little time to hop aboard and enjoy the ride. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/82813/the-true-story-of-a-carousel-riding-military-wife" target="_blank">My own mother</a> fell prey to this “newfound freedom.”</p>
<p>Recently separated or divorced women are some of the easiest targets out there. All they need to see is a little masculinity (something they likely haven’t seen in a while) and they’re putting their number into your phone before you can say “You seem cool….we should hang out sometime” and fully expect you to bang them later that night.</p>
<div style="width: 609px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../mahustlerszone.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/cougar.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="389"><p class="wp-caption-text">Newly single and ready to get fuc….uh……mingle!</p>
</div>
<p>While this is awesome for slut slayers, it’s terrible for men looking to settle down. Any woman who has at least one ex-husband has no doubt been slammed by hordes of men. And as we all know, the more men a woman has been fucked by, the less faithful she’ll be.</p>
<p>I imagine there are exceptions to this rule, though I’ve never seen or heard of such a case. Be that as it may, if you want to find out if your new chick jumped on the post-divorce carousel just ask her what she did right after she was separated and pretend to be excited and non judgmental about her answer.</p>
<p>If you’ve built enough trust and attraction with her she’ll spill some of her dirty little secrets, at which point you can act accordingly.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>When you see a green-haired chick with a tramp stamp and an industrial piercing in the beer aisle, it’s easy to place her into the whore category. But with females becoming more and more proficient at covering up their slutty tracks, it’s getting increasingly difficult for the average man to discern whether he’s committing to a quality female or the town bicycle.</p>
<p>Hopefully this column helps men get a clearer picture of who he’s dealing with because heaven knows his woman isn’t going to volunteer this information.</p>
