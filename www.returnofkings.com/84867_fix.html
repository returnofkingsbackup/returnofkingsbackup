<p align="left">Do you feel stuck? Does life seem stale and boring? Do you still get that looming sense of nihilism despite the fact that you’ve already gotten everything you wanted in life?</p>
<p align="left">When you get used to the same old routine in life, change can seem difficult, if not impossible. And when you submit to the slave life that our modern society has to offer, it’s easy to overlook all the options that are available to you. If you want change, try these 13 unorthodox methods to start a spark that will revitalize your life.</p>
<h3 align="left">1. Start with mundane changes</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84875" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/98951664.jpg" alt="98951664" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/98951664.jpg 640w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/98951664-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/98951664-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/98951664-574x323.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p align="left">Sometimes it’s not easy to make big changes from the get-go. So start small by making seemingly mundane changes to your life. Try listening to different genre of music, try different hobbies, change how you spend your free time, change your posture, expose yourself to strange new ideas through books and websites, etc. Making these small changes can snowball and lead to bigger changes—this method certainly worked for me.</p>
<h3 align="left">2. Read biographies</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84876" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_.jpg" alt="12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn" width="500" height="261" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_-300x157.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_-768x401.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_-837x437.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_-667x349.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_-262x137.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12237-man-hand-bible.1200w.tn_-574x300.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p align="left">Maybe your worldview is limited. Try to read biographies of men from the past to gain a perspective into what their passions were, how they carried themselves in everyday life, and how they went about striving for their goals. You can feel motivated, learn life lessons, or get new ideas about what you would like to do in your life.</p>
<h3 align="left">3. Do the opposite of what you normally do</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84874" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAUPAAAAJDAwZDZhYmRjLWMyMWEtNGNkZi1iNDQ3LTUxOTYxNzIyY2Q1NQ.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="317" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAUPAAAAJDAwZDZhYmRjLWMyMWEtNGNkZi1iNDQ3LTUxOTYxNzIyY2Q1NQ.jpg 700w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAUPAAAAJDAwZDZhYmRjLWMyMWEtNGNkZi1iNDQ3LTUxOTYxNzIyY2Q1NQ-300x190.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAUPAAAAJDAwZDZhYmRjLWMyMWEtNGNkZi1iNDQ3LTUxOTYxNzIyY2Q1NQ-667x423.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAUPAAAAJDAwZDZhYmRjLWMyMWEtNGNkZi1iNDQ3LTUxOTYxNzIyY2Q1NQ-262x166.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAUPAAAAJDAwZDZhYmRjLWMyMWEtNGNkZi1iNDQ3LTUxOTYxNzIyY2Q1NQ-574x364.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p align="left"><em>“Do you know what the definition of insanity is? It’s doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”</em></p>
<p align="left">If you ever watched the Seinfeld episode, then you know exactly what this is about. Start doing the opposite of what you’d normally do. If you usually put off work, start doing it right away from now on. If you usually let people walk all over you, start standing up for yourself. If you cower in fear of approaching a girl, do the approach before you get all the crazy thoughts that will stop you from doing so. You can only change when you start to challenge the auto-pilot within you.</p>
<h3 align="left">4. Write a list what you fear and defeat them</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84877" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015-10-20-1445358986-4977856-exposuretherapy.jpg" alt="2015-10-20-1445358986-4977856-exposuretherapy" width="500" height="332" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015-10-20-1445358986-4977856-exposuretherapy.jpg 636w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015-10-20-1445358986-4977856-exposuretherapy-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015-10-20-1445358986-4977856-exposuretherapy-262x174.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015-10-20-1445358986-4977856-exposuretherapy-574x381.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p align="left">Instead of writing down lame goals that you hope to achieve in the distant future, try listing your greatest fears instead. You can often learn more from your fears than you do with your desires.</p>
<p align="left">Do you fear being alone for the rest of your life? Do you fear being looked down upon by other people? Do you fear that you might die without any legacy to call your own? Do you fear that you won’t reach your potential? Do you fear that people will judge you if you were to be assertive? Write them all down and dedicate yourself to conquering them one by one. Once you conquer them all, you’ll be fearless and nothing will stop you from living your life under your own terms.</p>
<h3 align="left">5. Escape the West</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84870" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/prison-590x349.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="296" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/prison-590x349.jpg 590w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/prison-590x349-300x177.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/prison-590x349-262x155.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/prison-590x349-574x340.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p align="left">The West has long been corrupted with feminism, homosexuality, multiculturalism, and PC culture. Wondering why your life is miserable while living in some <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/74362/15-more-reasons-why-toronto-sucks-for-men">SJW cesspool</a> is like being in a prison and wondering why living conditions are so awful.</p>
<p align="left">Get out of your diseased society for an extended travel or just leave for good. If you don’t have anything to look forward to in your so-called home country, then you only have a better life to look forward to elsewhere.</p>
<h3 align="left">6. Go live in the wild</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84923" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2099246_its-building-time_zmenxska5dj2jibmji5yj45z64eatuw6lrlcsphco3flmkbrawuq_757x567-590x442.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2099246_its-building-time_zmenxska5dj2jibmji5yj45z64eatuw6lrlcsphco3flmkbrawuq_757x567-590x442.jpg 590w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2099246_its-building-time_zmenxska5dj2jibmji5yj45z64eatuw6lrlcsphco3flmkbrawuq_757x567-590x442-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2099246_its-building-time_zmenxska5dj2jibmji5yj45z64eatuw6lrlcsphco3flmkbrawuq_757x567-590x442-262x196.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2099246_its-building-time_zmenxska5dj2jibmji5yj45z64eatuw6lrlcsphco3flmkbrawuq_757x567-590x442-574x430.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Perhaps it’s not enough to escape just from the West. The world as a whole is becoming increasingly infected with progressivism, globalism, modern technology, and other forms of <a href="http://www.theprimalmale.com/antiphysical/">antiphysical</a> degeneracy, so It might not be so crazy to consider living in the wild.</p>
<p>Men don’t become strong and masculine by living in some cushy urban centers with Starbucks and air-conditioned offices. Men were meant to survive and thrive by building, enduring, and fighting. You probably don’t even realize just how comfortable and distracted you are by all the things that surround you until you abandon it all. It’s a personal desire of mine to go live in the woods or a quiet desert, away from all the inanity that our putrid society has to offer.</p>

</div>
<h3 align="left">7. Focus on helping others</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84871" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mt_climber_help_hand_cropped_1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="204" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mt_climber_help_hand_cropped_1.jpg 652w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mt_climber_help_hand_cropped_1-300x122.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mt_climber_help_hand_cropped_1-262x107.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Mt_climber_help_hand_cropped_1-574x234.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>It may seem counter-intuitive to be helping others when you’re looking to help yourself. And if that’s how you think, this may be exactly what you need—especially if you’re an accomplished man who has the wisdom and resources to give. In our atomized world that is obsessed with individual pleasure and shallow gratification, altruism and serving a greater purpose is exactly the remedy that many men need.</p>
<p>You can choose to help men close to you, including relatives and friends, or complete strangers both online and offline. Whatever you choose to do, be sure to do it through your genuine desire to bring value to the other person’s life unlike many in the West who do it out of their ‘holier-than-thou’ narcissism.</p>
<h3 align="left">8. Hop off the fence</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-84869" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/riding-the-fence.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/riding-the-fence.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/riding-the-fence-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/riding-the-fence-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Some people are too fixated with being impartial and neutral for the sake of being on the side of truth, reason, or whatever. Being neutral will not get you anywhere in life and you will remain as a nobody. To live, you sometimes have to throw your lot in. I myself am a nihilist at the core, but I know that such is not a life any man should strive for. And it is for that reason I’ve picked up a cause that will push me forward.</p>
<h3 align="left">9. Break your routines</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84872" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6.jpeg" alt="" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6.jpeg 1600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6-300x169.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6-768x432.jpeg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6-1200x675.jpeg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6-837x471.jpeg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6-667x375.jpeg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6-262x147.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/groundhogday6-574x323.jpeg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Does everyday seem the same? If so, then it’s probably due to the fact that you’re too comfortable with your established script. If you don’t like how your life is stuck in a loop, break out by smashing your routines. Try new things that make you uncomfortable, and avoid things that you numb yourself with—it’s the only way out. You’ll be surprised by just how much of a world there is out there for you to discover and experience.</p>
<h3 align="left">10. Live like a monk</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84878" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-Powerful-Life-Lessons-From-Studying-with-a-Monk.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="305" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-Powerful-Life-Lessons-From-Studying-with-a-Monk.jpg 639w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-Powerful-Life-Lessons-From-Studying-with-a-Monk-300x183.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-Powerful-Life-Lessons-From-Studying-with-a-Monk-262x160.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/9-Powerful-Life-Lessons-From-Studying-with-a-Monk-574x350.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Western consumerism and affluence is toxic to the masculine spirit. All the material comforts afforded by our society turn us weak and complacent, feminizing us in the process, and they shut off our drive for new challenges. Our society never ceases to turn us into mindless and distracted slaves that serve the interests of corporations and governments.</p>
<p>So instead, try living a minimalist life for a while where you only spend money on bare minimum needs while shunning all the mindless pleasures that bring no value to your life. Deprivation will teach you. Experience what it is like to live without desires and distractions, and you just might be amazed how different life feels.</p>
<h3>11. Ditch the people who drag you down</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84924" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/why-us-fish-jump.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="381" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/why-us-fish-jump.jpg 794w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/why-us-fish-jump-300x229.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/why-us-fish-jump-768x585.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/why-us-fish-jump-667x508.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/why-us-fish-jump-262x200.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/why-us-fish-jump-574x437.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>They say you’re an average of the five people you spend most time with. It might be worthwhile to examine the kind of people you spend time with. If they’re losers, they will infect you with their loser mentality. If they’re whiners, they’ll turn you into a whiner. If they’re weak and unmotivated, they will sap your own energy. You see the pattern?</p>
<p>I had one friend whom I kept around for a long time out of misguided sense of loyalty. The only reward I got was having us reinforce each other’s loserdom. I’m not friends with him anymore and I hope he’s doing well, but I’m glad I lost him.</p>
<h3>12. Take more risks and live dangerously</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84941" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Alain-Robert.jpg" alt="Alain-Robert" width="500" height="303" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Alain-Robert.jpg 640w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Alain-Robert-300x182.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Alain-Robert-262x159.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Alain-Robert-574x348.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>I have a theory that ennui and meaninglessness that plague our modern societies is the direct result of living a life without danger. Let’s face it, our lives in the West are just too safe and too comfortable; is it any wonder that so many men today are addicted to gambling, drugs, and video games as a result?</p>
<p>To change that, be <a href="http://www.theprimalmale.com/mens-number-one-irrational-fear/">stupid</a> (but not too stupid): take more risks in life.</p>
<h3 align="left">13. Change your goals</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-84873" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/changing-careers-at-30-40-50-guide-tips.jpg" alt="changing-careers-at-30-40-50-guide-tips" width="500" height="331" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/changing-careers-at-30-40-50-guide-tips.jpg 532w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/changing-careers-at-30-40-50-guide-tips-300x198.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/changing-careers-at-30-40-50-guide-tips-262x173.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The problem for you could be what you least expect: your goal. Perhaps your goal is not something you truly want. Maybe it’s a goal you’ve been conditioned to believe is important. Your goal can even be supremely idiotic and you might not even realize it now. I myself had several goals that I later abandoned when I realized how foolish they were.</p>
<p>It’s not always a good idea to have a single, grand goal and devote your life to it, “believing” in yourself that you will eventually actualize it. No, that’s foolish in our fast changing times. You wouldn’t bet your entire savings on a single investment, so why would you do that with goals? If you’re a slave to your dream, take a good look at yourself, take a good look at what you’re after, and take a good look at yourself again. Maybe it’s a supreme goal that you are fully capable of, maybe not. Only you can tell.</p>
