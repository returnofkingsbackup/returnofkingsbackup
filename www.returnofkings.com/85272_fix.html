<p>The Great Filter hypothesis is one of the most terrifying ideas in all of science. We often discuss problems related to sexual selection on men’s web sites, but what is seldom discussed is how it relates to the larger schemes of science and life in the rest of the universe. The Great Filter is one hypothesis that ties up these loose ends.</p>
<p>It has been said everything we see as progress in the human world is due to runaway sexual selection, and particularly K-selection for sophisticated societies. As explained in The Evolutionary Psychology Behind Politics:</p>
<blockquote><p>One strategy, named the r-strategy, imbues those who are programmed with it to be averse to all peer on peer competition, embrace promiscuity, embrace single parenting, and support early onset sexual activity in youth. Obviously, this mirrors the Liberal philosophy’s aversion to individual Darwinian competitions such as capitalism and self defense with firearms, as well as group competitions such as war. Likewise, Liberalism is tolerant of promiscuity, tolerant of single parenting, and more prone to support early sex education for children and the sexualization of cultural influences. Designed to exploit a plethora of resources, one will often find this r-type strategy embodied within prey species, where predation has lowered the population’s numbers, and thereby increased the resources available to its individuals.</p></blockquote>

</div>
<blockquote><p>The other strategy, termed the K-strategy, imbues those who pursue it with a fierce competitiveness, as well as tendencies towards abstinence until monogamy, two-parent parenting, and delaying sexual activity until later in life. Obviously, this mirrors Conservatism’s acceptance of all sorts of competitive social schemes, from free market capitalism, to war, to individuals owning and carrying private weapons for self defense. Conservatives also tend to favor abstinence until monogamy, two parent parenting with an emphasis upon “family values” and children being shielded from any sexualized stimuli until later in life. This strategy is found most commonly in species which lack predation, and whose population’s have grown to the point individuals must compete with each other for the limited environmental resources that they are rapidly running out of.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seeing as humans seem to be subject to cyclical forces in history, one must wonder what the future of our species is since we are currently on the downswing of the great historical sine-wave and we are making a sharp turn towards r-selection. The prime reason we are on the downswing is feminism has unleashed the primitive sexual forces of women in the West. No society that has remained civilized has lifted restrictions on monogamy and female sexuality, as anthropologist J.D. Unwin found when he studied 80 tribes and 6 civilizations. Will we recover? Or, as astrophysicist Carl Sagan put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve arranged a global civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology. We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Drake Equation</h3>
<p>Back in the 1960s, astrophysicist Frank Drake proposed an equation to estimate the number of societies that might exist in the universe. It is based on the number of stars in the galaxy, the number of those stars that have planets, the number of those planets that can support life and the number on which life actually arises.</p>
<p>Using this imperfect equation, Drake came up with a very rough estimate of anywhere from 20 to 50,000,000 societies potentially existing in the Milky Way galaxy. If that is the case—where the hell is everybody? Either intelligent life is exceedingly rare or exceedingly short-lived on evolutionary timescales. Enter The Great Filter hypothesis.</p>

<h3>The Great Filter</h3>
<blockquote><p>The Great Filter concept originates in the argument that the failure to find any extraterrestrial civilizations in the observable universe implies the possibility something is wrong with one or more of the arguments from various scientific disciplines that the appearance of advanced intelligent life is probable; this observation is conceptualized in terms of a Great Filter which acts to reduce the great number of sites where intelligent life might arise to a tiny number of intelligent species.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, it is the idea there is a Great Filter humanity will be subjected to that will lead to its downfall. After passing through this filter, humanity either survives as a non-technological civilization (returning to the cave dwelling life our ancestors if we are lucky) or goes extinct. It gets worse.</p>
<blockquote><p>The main counter-intuitive conclusion of this observation is that the easier it was for life to evolve to our stage, the bleaker our future chances probably are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Enrico Fermi was the first to notice the seeming complete lack of civilizations in the universe once radio astronomy began. In our own galaxy there are some 400 billion suns, and based on what we have seen with the distribution of organic molecules throughout the universe it should not only be possible but <em>probable</em> that life exists elsewhere in the universe.</p>

 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>

<p>Also, life arose on earth almost immediately after it formed which makes it seem like life forms easily in the universe. However, this fact is a double edged sword because we aren’t finding life in the universe despite exhaustive searches and improving technology. This means 9 out of 10 societies could be self-destructing once they reach a certain level of technology.</p>

</div>
<h3>How This Relates To Us</h3>
<p>Some scientists say we could be at the most crucial stage in our long-term survival as a species: the stage at which we reach interplanetary and interstellar colonization. Many societies could have developed up to our point in the universe and fallen apart soon after. It is interesting to note the U.S. has long led scientific exploration of space, but since the sexual revolution took root we now hitch rides on Russian rockets in order to fly humans into space.</p>
<p>Sexual selection is the engine that drives evolution to high levels of intelligence, and perhaps once any society reaches our level of development it eases up restrictions on monogamy.</p>
<p>This is risky business as we have seen since the sexual revolution in the West with falling birth rates, the exile of the father from the family, and the rise of degeneracy. J.D. Unwin found in his anthropological survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs.</p></blockquote>
<p>After unleashing all restrictions on female sexuality, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/04/18/the-10-laws-of-the-mating-game/">men adapt to the drastically altered sexual environment by learning game</a>. But, this leads to an 80/20 rule of most females being monopolized by a small percentages of males. <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/04/21/the-alpha-sigma-beta-gamma-and-omega-male/">Betas, the bedrock of building and maintaining society</a> then check out of doing grunt work since the sexual market is the granddaddy of all the other markets of man. Environmental conditions that led to the development of high intelligence and a high culture then self-destruct, causing the society to fall apart.</p>

<img class=" wp-image-85605" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-300x169.jpg" alt="Implanted RFID chips are closer to reality than you might think" width="495" height="279" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-768x432.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-1200x675.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID-574x323.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RFID.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Implanted RFID chips are closer to reality than you might think</p>
</div>
<h3>Technological Enslavement</h3>
<p>Another worrying sign that seems to be coming into existence in the West is technological enslavement. With the advent of ever cheaper, smaller, and faster computer chips it is plausible that the human race will be enslaved by an elite. Perhaps this is why the limitations on female sexuality were removed in the first place. Man becomes feral after monogamy is abandoned, and is not able to organize the way he would have in an orderly, monogamous society to avert the threat of technological enslavement.</p>
<p>Forces are already at work to eliminate cash completely and put all money and all documentation on a GPS-trackable RFID chip that will be implanted into our hands. <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/04/09/the-war-on-cash-japan-to-use-fingerprint-currency/">Japan is conducting its own experiments in this vaunted “cashless” society</a> by using fingerprints. In any case, our lives are increasingly managed by computers and micromanaged by a government that manages the computers.</p>
<p>As the Financial Times pointed out:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="openQuote">The</span> anonymity of cash helps to free people from their governments.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aaron Russo <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/02/25/no-paper-money-equals-slavery/">warned us about this agenda over 10 years ago</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>All money will be in your chips. And so, instead of having cash, any time you have money in your chip, they can take out whatever they want to take out whenever they want to. If they say “you owe us this much money in taxes,” they just deduct it out of your chip, digitally.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Using social engineering, Cultural Marxism and total financial control (all of which are advancing at a rapid rate) the human species could be transformed into docile servants of the state. This view, as pessimistic as it is falls in line with history. As Aristotle observed 2,000 years ago, the natural state of man is slavery. The politicians know this, which is why <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/01/19/why-politicians-are-liars-and-why-people-believe-them/">they lie in our faces and get away with it</a>.</p>
<p>Work on the implantable RFID chip <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/02/28/the-future-of-the-world-echoes-the-borg/">proceeds at a rapid pace</a>. The only real boundary now is engineering social acceptance of an electronic dog collar.</p>

</div>
<h3>What Worked In The Past</h3>
<p>What these dystopian views have in common is they’re all illustrations of the value of patriarchy and the grand error of discarding it. Patriarchy, with its paternity guarantees for men and provision of a role in society other than that of a sperm donor and child support check-writer has led our society to greatness in the past.</p>
<p>The decision to toss patriarchy overboard is having profound implications, and it is not leading us to a better place as a society or as a species. The sexual revolution brought on the law of the jungle and the 80/20 phenomenon and is making the human species more feral with each passing generation.</p>
<p>What incentive does a man have to give a damn about society or sacrificing for the betterment of his offspring if he is no longer offered a seat at the table of the human family? Man is also becoming easier to boss around as r-selection breaks down the family, the building block of civilization; bossing him around is much harder to do when the family is headed up by a strong patriarch. The solitary individual is much more desirable to an autocratic society.</p>
<p>Perhaps the human species’ Great Filter has arrived via either de-civilizing feminism, matriarchy, technological enslavement, or an unholy trinity of all three. With a 99.9% extinction rate across a span of 4.5 billion years, the odds are not in our favor. Personally, I would prefer extinction to enslavement.</p>
