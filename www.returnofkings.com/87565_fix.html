<p>The free fall continues. Pedophile Todd Nickerson just published a new article and video with support of Salon this month. In the piece, video of a young girl in a pink dress plays while Nickerson rationalizes his lust for children, and describes “relieving himself” of his sexual lust in the bathroom after spending time with her.</p>
<p>The march towards total sexual degeneracy continues at a rapid pace in Anglo America. Even as heterosexuals (and especially heterosexual men) are just getting used to their new second-class status as a result of the ongoing Marxist revolution, social engineers are already at work destroying the last vestiges of morality and sexual restraint in the culture. In a display of just how duplicitous the American legal system is, even though there are laws against prostitution in every state some states do not have laws against sex with animals, and now leftist media is pushing for legal acceptance of pedophilia. As George Carlin said about prostitution: <em>Selling is legal, fucking is legal. <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/04/13/prostitution-heinous-crime-or-the-government-in-your-bedroom/">Why isn’t selling fucking legal? Why should it be illegal to sell something you can give away?</a> </em></p>
<p>Beyond the comedy and contradictions of the American legal system and the marginalization of heterosexuals, sometime soon it is reasonable to expect people who do not support pedophilia will be called bigots, cave dwellers, and other colorful labels the left invents, because to leftists sex with children (and later sex with animals) is just another lifestyle choice.</p>

<h3>Enter Todd Nickerson</h3>
<p>The leftist Salon magazine has been at the forefront of pushing the pedophilia agenda. In fact, Todd Nickerson has become their unofficial poster boy, as they attempt to knock down the remaining columns that hold up what’s left of Western Civilization. Twice within the last year they have given Nickerson the podium, letting him push his blog called Virtuous Pedophiles. It’s a strategy that uses Saul Alinsky’s 10th Rule for Radicals: <em>If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive. </em>Nickerson plays the victim card, just as homosexuals did for a generation before gay marriage was legalized:</p>
<blockquote><p>My purpose is to go out and educate people, allowing people like myself to come out and be open. Society makes it harder by persecuting us because a lot of us become fatalistic. We start to think it doesn’t matter what we do or say they’re going to hate us anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to marginalizing those who do not want to live in a society where pedophilia is the norm as “ignorant” people who need to be “educated,” Salon pushes the victim narrative, reporting that poor Nickerson had to pack up and leave town after he “came out” to his family so he wouldn’t <em>offend</em> anyone. (Offend is, of course, an insidious leftist code word.) Nickerson says he learned he was a pedophile at age 18 when he babysat a 5-year old girl that he “fell in love with” but did not act on his urges.</p>
<p>Salon ran another Nickerson piece in September 2015 entitled “I’m a pedophile, not a monster.” In the bloviating screed, Salon lets him label pedophilia as an <em>alternate sexual behavior. </em>Nickerson did receive at least some support after posting the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<section class="fyre-comment-body">
<div class="fyre-comment">
<p>Maybe he’s right. Maybe pedophilia is, at least for some people, an intractable in-born trait that it is possible to have without supporting or endorsing. I think we should all at least have the humility to entertain the possibility he knows his own experience better than we do.</p>
<p>There’s nothing about being able to sympathize with someone who possesses a terrible trait that they didn’t choose for themselves that precludes us from also taking every necessary step to protect kids. I know this much is true: historically, acting out of a sense of moral panic (whether that was communists, witches or drugs) has pretty much always made us less safe because it removes our ability to think.</p>
</div>
</section>
</blockquote>
<p>Next up will be crackpot psychologists defending pedophilia as an alternative lifestyle choice (already happening in legacy media publications like the Los Angeles Times as we will see, but becoming more widespread in the future), before the media take up the issue, turning it into another circus, and legislators once again bend their knee as a lobby for pedophilia organizes.</p>

<h3>Destroying Morality</h3>
<p>This latest attack is another in a long line aimed at demoralizing the population. There is no doubt the normalization of all sexual urges will reduce human beings to a pre-civilization level of existence, i.e. <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/05/the-law-of-the-jungle-rules-todays-sexual-market/">return man to a sexual jungle</a>. Legalizing pedophilia and bestiality will be the capstones of the Marxist revolution that is ongoing right now across the Western world. Once America and Europe have been broken, the rest of the world will fall into line like dominoes.</p>
<p>Feminism was only the first chapter in the move against humanity. Even though anthropologists <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/30/jd-unwin-detailed-how-feminism-would-destroy-culture-30-years-before-womens-lib/">knew a century ago that lifting restrictions on monogamy and female sexual freedom would cause society to collapse</a>, their warnings were not heeded either because of foolishness, ignorance, or on purpose. Sex and Culture, published in 1934 by J.D. Unwin, was considered “a work of the highest importance” by Aldous Huxley, whose warnings about where America was going were also not heeded. Huxley wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unwin’s conclusions, which are based upon an enormous wealth of carefully sifted evidence, may be summed up as follows. All human societies are in one or another of four cultural conditions: zoistic, manistic, deistic, rationalistic. Of these societies the zoistic displays the least amount of mental and social energy, the rationalistic the most. Investigation shows that the societies exhibiting the least amount of energy are those where pre-nuptial continence is not imposed and where the opportunities for sexual indulgence after marriage are greatest. The cultural condition of a society rises in exact proportion as it imposes pre-nuptial and post-nuptial restraints upon sexual opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Unwin’s study of 80 tribes and 6 civilizations, these startling findings were published:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole of human history does not contain a single instance of a group becoming civilized unless it has been absolutely monogamous, nor is there any example of a group retaining its culture after it has adopted less rigorous customs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sexual market is the grandfather of all the other markets of man. Once a society becomes liberal with sexual behavior, it loses its cohesion, impetus, and purpose. The abandonment of any sexual restraint puts America on the road to becoming a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah with a low level of social and mental energy. In other words, it puts us on the road to Idiocracy.</p>

<h3>“You Are a Bigot”</h3>
<p>Because of the genius with which the left is enacting these de-civilizing policies and bringing them into the media for mainstream discussion, it is likely they will soon begin marginalizing resisters. As with so many other cultural norms that have been razed in the West, anyone who resists will be labeled a bigot. The puppet masters have realized enormous success using this playbook. Look how far they have already pushed Western culture. Gayness is lionized by the media because, after all, someone can’t help that they’re gay. Transsexuals can’t help they were a woman born in a man’s body and want to use a bathroom that is the opposite of their anatomy. And, coming soon, pedophiles can’t help that they’re attracted to children.</p>
<p>Barack Obama has already said he thinks sex education in kindergarten is “the right thing to do.” In addition, he threatened to cut off school lunch funding for poor children at schools that did not provide third gender bathrooms to children in a thinly veiled effort at sexualizing children. The Los Angeles Times jumped on board with the pedophilia narrative, placing pedophilia on the same level as heterosexuality as it reported the sob story of pedophile Paul Cristiano who told reporters he prefers pre-pubescent girls.</p>
<blockquote><p>Many researchers taking a different view of pedophilia: Pedophilia once was thought to stem from psychological influences early in life. Now, many experts view it as a deep-rooted predisposition that does not change. “These people felt they could snuff out the desire, or shame me into denying it existed,” he said. “But it’s as intrinsic as the next person’s heterosexuality.”<em><br>
</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Western civilization is already on a slippery slope as it slides towards mainstreaming pedophilia. Leftists have already set a precedent unseen in world history with the enshrinement of homosexual marriage into law. As The New American put it, there is no historical precedent in the world for the acceptance of faux marriage yet America accepted it. There is, however a lengthy history of pedophilia across the world:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet if I say that our current cultural trajectory — a bizarre trek that has caused us to boldly go where no American had gone before — has as a point on its arc the acceptance of pedophilia, I’m sure I’ll hear “never, ever under the stars and stripes!” This is a normal human reaction. But the past is a picture of futures man inevitably will paint again, and history hollers its warnings for those with ears to hear.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is indeed a history of pedophilia in humans, but as Unwin pointed out it was seen only when a society was declining. One must think about this critically: with a retrograde push for men to be able to have sex with children, the marginalization of heterosexuality, and pushing androgyny of the men and women, what is the end goal of this insanity?</p>
<p>Once the full agenda of sexual degeneracy and moral relativism is realized, considering the lack of resistance Americans have put up so far to the agendas designed to break civilization, we will have arrived in a dystopia where everything is normal and nothing can be judged. Moral relativism, which tells us we can’t judge the behavior of others, even if they are child molesters is ultimately a deal with the devil. The 1960s mantra “If it feels good do it!” has become the theme on our road to hell.</p>

<h3>Change Tactics</h3>
<p>Traditionalists and conservatives tend to put up symbolic opposition to changes like these, before eventually caving in and kowtowing to the demands of the “oppressed.” This is the wrong tactic when fighting in war, whether it be a cultural war or a literal one. By setting the tone of the discussion in advance, liberals are ensuring conservatives play defense. Ancient Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu, master tactician and author of The Art of War would not approve. From Chapter 6, Weak Points and Strong:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to the colossal error of letting the left set the conditions of the narrative, other tactics must be changed. Each time a leftist agenda item is shoved in their faces, the left imposes their will on the right rather than the other way around. Sun Tzu continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy’s will to be imposed on him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">Since many conservatives are already reeling from 50 years or more of losses in the Culture War, they’re lost and most have no idea where the next attack will come from (like the pedophilia agenda):</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">The left also plays the victim card and uses what Bertrand Russell called The Fallacy of the Superior Virtue of the Oppressed as a shield, while they strike with their sword of moral relativism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">Conservatives consistently play defense rather than putting the left in a defensive crouch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">These short passages illustrate only a few of the ways the culture war will be lost and pedophilia will be imposed on the population if those against degeneracy do not change tactics. The re-education of the public to accept any sexual behavior, while criminalizing heterosexuality in every way possible (i.e. there is a new push against stare rape) is an attempt at reducing humans to the equivalent of easily manipulated farm animals, who, echoing the battery metaphor in The Matrix, only exist to create profit for their masters on the Anglo-American (and eventually world) tax farm. H.L. Mencken wrote about the true aims of those in power:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">The aim…is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. That is its aim in the United States, whatever the pretensions of politicians, pedagogues and other such mountebanks, and that is its aim everywhere else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="bodytext">Will the push to normalize pedophilia be the breaking point in the Culture War, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/19/three-minutes-to-midnight-for-western-civilization/">and a turning point before the stroke of midnight</a>? Or will Americans once again march to the orders of the left when this issue soon enters the Overton Window?</p>
