<p>Starting at the end of 2015, I began seeing a sharp rise of women declaring themselves to be “anti-feminist.” They created Twitter accounts and Youtube channels to mock social justice warriors and feminists in similar ways that we have, even borrowing our talking points. While they may come across as genuine, these female infiltrators are mostly attention whoring to a male audience. They don’t want to change the world—they just want you to look at them.</p>
<p>If you have an anti-feminist movement with a high percentage of women in it, you don’t have an anti-feminist movement. The reason is that single women raised in the West will find it impossible to go against the female urge of sleeping with whomever they want and having complete control over their lives to pursue useless college degrees and degenerate behaviors. The only exception is women who want to be mothers before 30, but such women wouldn’t waste her time “building a brand” online instead of creating the family she greatly desires.</p>
<h4>Anti-feminists share great overlap in ideology with actual feminists</h4>

<p>The new anti-feminist will bash SJWs and their censorship efforts with great vigor, but when it’s time for society to stop them from opening their legs to sexy alpha males, they throw a temper tantrum. When it’s time to force them adopt <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/traditional-gender-roles-create-feminine-women">traditional behaviors</a> of maintaining a home instead of merely agreeing to traditional ideas in theory, they reveal themselves to be feminists at heart and use SJW language that labels you a “misogynist” or “rapist.”</p>
<p>I’ve had numerous “anti-feminists” in infiltrated movements (alt right, gamergate, men’s rights) attack me to the point where I can’t tell the difference between them and standard issue SJWs, even though our enemy is supposedly the same. This includes popular “anti-feminist” Shoe0nhead, pictured at the top of this article with one of her many Arabian lovers that she is desperate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKCW59ZXJj8">to keep secret</a> for some reason. The reality is that anti-feminists like her are more aligned with the enemy than ourselves. They used entryist tactics that started with merely uploading a female avatar and looking pretty in webcam pictures.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the rise of anti-feminists is not necessarily the strength of our ideas, but the fact that the feminist camp is too crowded. Being a feminist and holding an “I need feminism” sign used to be a great way to get attention online without having to show tits, but with thousands of girls doing it, any one girl no longer stands out. The practice of anti-feminism by females is therefore an alternative strategy to getting attention. Consider that a girl who is a 6 out of 10 can now make a Youtube video denouncing feminism and easily get 25,000 views. It’s also a way for girls to show men that they are “hip,” “dangerous,” and “cool.” Men online are so thirsty and lonely that they lavish these girls with attention because they’re “just like one of the guys.”<br>

<h4>The anti-feminist test</h4>
<p>These anti-feminist females are not traditional and not even conservative. They are liberals in disguise. You can ask them these questions to reveal where their true sympathies lie:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Are you against homosexual marriage?”</li>
<li>“Do you believe it’s ideal for a woman to remain a virgin until she gets married?”</li>
<li>“Do you believe that it’s best for children to be raised by a stay-at-home mother?”</li>
<li>“Do you believe a woman’s choices should be constrained by her husband, tribe, or church with the intention of doing what’s best for her?”</li>
<li>“Do you believe it’s wrong for a young girl to find herself by traveling around the world and trying new experiences?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck finding an anti-feminist who says yes to even two of the above questions. I suspect the only girl who would is already married and a stay-at-home mother who happily submits to her masculine husband.</p>
<p>While the anti-feminists have been useful during group actions against SJWs online, the drawback is that their platform size may grow enough to cause damage in the future when they have a difficult menstrual cycle and start needless drama by attacking genuine conservatives. They will not submit to anything but their <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-decline-of-american-women">female biology and bottomless pit of narcissism</a> while the weak men who follow them act as their enablers and white knights.</p>
<p>In spite of their big talk online, anti-feminists ultimately want to maintain the status quo, and have taken on our ideas as a strategy to get attention and fill the childless void in their lives. They will have absolutely no place within the sphere of <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-neomasculinity">neomasculinity</a>.</p>
