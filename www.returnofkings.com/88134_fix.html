<p>Every day, I open the news headlines hoping for some break in the barrage of bad news befalling our society. And every day, I am disappointed as things get worse, not better. At times it is like waking up in the middle of some awful dream that won’t end. At times I feel despair as the odds are stacked against those who value freedom, masculinity, femininity, and self-determination.</p>
<p>The propaganda ministers are so smooth, duplicitous and efficient they have brainwashed millions. An elite controls all the money and all the weapons. Americans think the Second Amendment will protect them from the specter of abject tyranny, and while it offers some modicum of protection, with the advanced weaponry the government has access any opposition will most likely be very bloody, and ineffective when the clock strikes midnight and a false flag pretext to martial law signals the end of the Old World Order.</p>
<p>Warnings about the world we have awakened to have fallen on deaf ears for half a century. Bellies are full but souls are empty. People are busy licking their chops and loosening their belts to accommodate expanding waistlines as they eat like pigs at the corporate feedbag rather than paying attention to the noose quietly being slipped around their necks. As evidence, total sales of food at restaurants just surpassed sales of food bought at grocery stores for the first time in history. Much of the binging out (eating out) is driven by millennials, who view dining at as a social event, as cooking becomes a lost art since feminists turned the kitchen into the vortex of hell in the female mind.</p>
<p>America in the 21st century has morphed into the Land of Cockaigne, as depicted by Dutch Renaissance artist Breugel the Elder:</p>
<blockquote><p>In medieval times, Cockaigne was a mythical land of plenty, but Bruegel’s depiction of Cockaigne and its residents is not meant to be a flattering one. He chooses rather a comic illustration of the spiritual emptiness believed to derive from gluttony and sloth, two of the seven deadly sins.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sheeple are also impulse buying their way into $733 billion of credit card bondage, as eating out and shopping are essentially the only government-approved outlets for their Freudian ids. As further evidence of how enslaved people are by over-consumption:</p>
<ul>
<li>$8.25 trillion is owed on mortgages (mortgage literally means pay until death)</li>
<li>$1.06 trillion is owed on car loans</li>
<li>$1.23 trillion is owed on student loans</li>
</ul>
<p>But, it gets worse. As if being debt slaves addicted to the greasy, slow death of fast food, and lifestyles of buying crap we don’t need to impress people we don’t like wasn’t enough, a more insidious type of slavery, electronic slavery, is closing in on us.</p>

<h3>The End of Free Speech and Anonymity</h3>
<p>Last week offered quite a number of disturbing stories to anyone paying attention and concerned about the loss of freedom in the world. First, the EU proposed requiring government ID to log on to the internet. This would effectively end freedom of expression and anonymity online. Indeed, governments are good at taking rights away from people then selling them back under the guise of “licensing.” Following the frequently used and abused Hegelian dialectic, which <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/30/getting-a-chip-implanted-as-normal-as-using-a-barcode-to-local-reporter/">clueless media talking heads in America are now using to tell people to accept getting microchips implanted into their children</a>, because chip implants are just as harmless as bar codes, the Soviet… er… European Union released this statement, selling tyranny under the guise of keeping people safe:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is recognized that a multitude of username and password combinations is both inconvenient and a security risk. In order to keep identification simple and secure, consumers should be able to choose the credentials by which they want to identify or authenticate themselves. In particular, <strong>online platforms should only accept credentials issued or recognized by national public authorities, such as electronic or mobile IDs, national identity cards, or bank cards.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Already, EU member Estonia, a former Communist country boasts how wonderful its mandatory electronic ID card has been. The blueprint for centralized control of all human activity is evident in how the card is used:</p>
<ul>
<li>For “legal travel” <em>[there’s such a thing as illegal travel now?]</em>
</li>
<li>As the national health insurance card <em>[didn’t get your mandated vaccine last year?]</em>
</li>
<li>As proof of identification when logging into bank accounts from a home computer<em> [no access to cash means corrupt banksters and politicians have total control over lives as money buys freedom]</em>
</li>
<li>As a public transport ticket <em>[no ticky, no laundry]</em>
</li>
<li>For digital signatures</li>
<li>For i-voting</li>
<li>For accessing government databases to check one’s medical records, file taxes, etc.</li>
<li>For picking up e-Prescriptions</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the intent of electronic ID is to make it so people cannot go take a shit without government permission, and for them to pay a tax each time they do.</p>
<p>Beyond implementing government control and censorship of the Internet, freedom of movement is threatened by growing electronic tyranny. There is the newly introduced, unbelievable concept of<em> illegal travel</em> as evidenced above. Adding to the mess, a new app is tracking the movements of people around the world using their faces, according to MarketWatch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A new app called FindFace, recently released in Russia, gives us a glimpse into what this future might look like. FindFace allows anybody to snap a photo of a passerby and discover their real name — already with 70% reliability.</p>
<p>Nearly 250 million video surveillance cameras have been installed throughout the world, and chances are you’ve been seen by several of them today. Soon anybody with a high-resolution camera and the right software will be able to determine your identity. Recognition algorithms have become far more accurate, the devices we carry can process huge amounts of data, and there’s massive databases of faces now available on social media that are tied to our real names.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s an example of how this software could be used: Say you show up on the streets of Kolkota with a<strong> legal</strong> prostitute in your young and stupid years, and a FindFace image of you gets uploaded into a government database at oh, let’s say the Utah Data Center. The government uses the image, as it already uses red light cameras, to fine you for becoming a signed risk in its socialist healthcare system, even though the CDC’s own statistics tell us even if you had unprotected vaginal sex with someone known to have the HIV virus you only have a 1 in 10,000 chance of contracting the virus. No worries, the doubled premium will be deducted out with your next Shared Responsibility Payment.</p>
<p>By the way, you can’t refuse to pay because all money has been made electronic. Oops…had a Coca-Cola with dinner? No worries, the soda tax was automatically deducted. But wait, you’ve had 7 sodas this month, which puts you at a higher risk for Type II diabetes. The limit is 6 sodas per month. Your Shared Responsibility Payment will have to be increased again. Oh, and it seems you’ve been hanging out a lot outside of town. Sorry, but we are going to have to restrict your area of travel as your carbon emissions are too high. Your car will automatically shut off if you drive outside the restricted area. Your electronic ID will also not allow you to make any purchases in that area code. See how insidious this can get?</p>
<p>These stories came on the heels of another report showing arrests once again have surged in Merry Old England for social media posts that violated Orwellian “online crimes of speech” and a hypocritical crackdown on online “hate speech” by Faceberg and other majors in the social media world. As Paul Joseph Watson reported, Facebook refused to take pages like “I Fucking Want to Kill Donald Trump” down despite numerous reports that it violated their “Community Standards,” while it removed posts remotely critical of one of the protected classes on the modern day Animal Farm. Read: If you are Caucasian, and especially if you are a Caucasian male, you are NOT a protected class.</p>

<h3>Moral Relativism And The End Of Freedom</h3>
<p>Americans and Europeans thought they won the Cold War only to wake up a generation later and find themselves in the midst of a socialist revolution. The tenets of Marxism are steadily being implemented in the U.S. and Europe. Pat Buchanan sounded the alarm in an interview about Cultural Marxism:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States has undergone a cultural, moral and religious revolution. A militant secularism has arisen in this country. It has always had a hold on the intellectual and academic elites, but in the 1960s it captured the young in the universities and the colleges. This is the basis of the great cultural war we’re undergoing… We are two countries now. We are two countries morally, culturally, socially, and theologically. Cultural wars do not lend themselves to peaceful co-existence. One side prevails, or the other prevails. The truth is that while conservatives won the Cold War with political and economic Communism, we’ve lost the cultural war with cultural Marxism, which I think has prevailed pretty much in the United States. It is now the dominant culture. Whereas those of us who are traditionalists, we are, if you will, the counterculture.</p></blockquote>
<p>The coming end to free speech and anonymity are only the latest chapters in the socialist revolution saga. Laying the groundwork, Marxists have fulfilled many of the tenets of the Communist Manifesto in varying degrees, including centralization of both communication and transportation. Already, 6 corporations own 90% of the media and the EU openly dreams of requiring government issued ID to use the internet. (A similar proposal is in the pipeline in America.) Then we have the ever-expanding and intrusive TSA. By the way, in recent years the TSA has been expanding its grasp onto America’s roads with VIPR checkpoints, which subject people to searches on the highway that are similar to those at airports.</p>
<p>A handful of corporations now control 90% of the purchases we make at the supermarket, fulfilling another tenet of the Communist Manifesto: centralization of the means of production. Free government education for the masses, expatriation fines for people who try to leave the country (currently $2,350 to officially renounce citizenship), centralization of the money supply, a progressive income tax, and government control of private property through property taxes—in which people never really own their property as much as they rent it from the government—are other tenets of the Communist Manifesto that have been implemented. In fact, America has already completed 8 out of 10 of the tenets in the Manifesto to varying degrees!</p>
<p>Marxists are coming out the woodwork with even more evil designs, openly discussing new items on their checklist they want to implement once the masses are under complete, centralized control. Government bureaucrats, including one of the architects of Obamacare, Ezekiel Emmanuel (Rahm’s brother), <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/09/is-killing-people-at-age-75-on-the-agenda/">are openly discussing age 75 as the politically correct time for people to die</a>, suggesting a scheme of government euthanization could ultimately come about as people should not let themselves become “burdens” after they have lived out their usefulness to society. Eugenics, anyone?</p>
<p>Marxists are also pushing the implementation of 1,000 new, micromanaging bureaucracies, carbon “sin” wealth transfers from America and Europe to the rest of the world, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/20/what-is-really-being-discussed-by-governments-at-global-warming-conferences/">and giving rights of legal personality Mother Earth to sue and bankrupt Western nations in a world climate court at annual global warming conferences</a>. (No, they’re not discussing sunshine, lollipops, and rainbows as the media would have you believe.)</p>
<p>Without giving their subjects time to recover from the last shock to their system, social engineers are now busy turning pedophiles the next protected class. The ultimate goal is a world of moral relativism and top-down bureaucratic control in which no human behavior can be judged, and people have to get government permission to breathe. (We all exhale carbon, which is now classified a pollutant even though all life on earth is made of it and cannot live without it!)</p>

<h3>Libertarianism vs. Authoritarianism</h3>
<p>The battle we find ourselves in the middle of today between<em> live and let live</em> people and the authoritarians is unending in the history of civilization. In Ancient China, a similar battle played out between the Legalists, Confucians and Taoists, with Murray Rothbard calling the Taoists “the world’s first libertarians.” Mises Daily details the philosophy of each group, and this excerpt makes it obvious the type of battle we are fighting today stretches back thousands of years.</p>
<blockquote><p>Roughly, the Legalists, the latest of the three broad schools, simply believed in maximal power to the state, and advised rulers how to increase that power. The Taoists were the world’s first libertarians, who believed in virtually no interference by the state in economy or society, and the Confucians were middle-of-the-roaders on this critical issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone who loves freedom and liberty knows we are currently on the losing side of this eternal struggle, and electronics offer a chance for “Legalist” authoritarians to realize social and political control that goes beyond their wildest dreams. The battle is not Democrat vs. Republican. It is libertarianism vs. authoritarianism, plain and simple. Both major American political parties have become authoritarian. (And the fake Gary Johnson is a liberal wolf in Libertarian sheep’s clothing, as he said he agrees with Bernie Sanders on 73% of the issues.)</p>
<p>What is most disheartening is even though great numbers of people seem to be awakening, the masses seem content to scratch their bellies, lick their lips, drool, and wait for a government check to arrive, oblivious to their ongoing enslavement. It is time for men to throw off their cultural indoctrination, stop with the meekness, stand up, and say hell no to the chains that are being forged around us day by day. Electronic tyranny is the new method of authoritarianism, and the creep of it into all aspects of our lives must be stopped.</p>
<p>If we fail as guardians of society, we have only ourselves to blame. As men, no one is going to come help us out. We should have never let ourselves boxed so far into a corner. No, better to adapt this mindset, as so brilliantly laid out by The Savage Lifestyle:</p>
<blockquote><p>Then the paltry crumbs of self righteous virtue signaling become yours to parade around to other simps all competing in a pathetic clown act.  Stepping on and over one another in wanton displays of who is the weakest and loudest crybaby. In a race to to the ABSOLUTE BOTTOM. To mock these detestable caricatures is to establish a clear boundary. You will not stand for that shit. Contrarily in the glorious and unmolested expanses of still wild Nature we observe plainly which values are most important to a given species.  At the foundation of the natural and savage earth is this: Survival of the species. The strong survive. The weak perish. No amount of millennial tears, hashtags, online petitions, and circle jerk slacktivism will change this brutal truth.  The impish weakling of the modern world does not stop slaking his overwhelming thirst for consumption at this manure trough of cultural and personal suicide.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those are our choices: Continue to consume ourselves to death on the path to suicide or stand up for survival. We have several options available right now. Peaceful civil disobedience, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/26/7-steps-on-the-road-to-minimalism/">downshifting to a lifestyle of minimalism</a> to “starve the beast” of tax money, and most importantly, no longer staying silent and hoping for the best.</p>
