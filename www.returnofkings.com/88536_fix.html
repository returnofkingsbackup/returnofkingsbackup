<p>With the Democratic primary all but settled and the GOP firmly under the aegis of Donald Trump, the general election has effectively begun. While it’s common for political partisans to claim that this or that election is the “MOST IMPORTANT ELEK-SHUN EVAR!!!!!11”, the 2016 presidential race <em>is </em>absolutely paramount for those who value free speech, and the only candidate who can defend freedom of speech is Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The past eight years have seen Barack Obama and the radical left transform America to the point where it’s barely recognizable. Obama’s tenure gave birth to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/87483/black-lives-matter-protesters-shut-down-milo-yiannopoulos-speech-in-chicago">the hordes of pierced-lipped, easily triggered social justice warriors</a> roaming college campuses like a herd of hormonally-damaged buffalo. It was under Obama that <em>Gawker, Buzzfeed</em> and other sites <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/17187/pax-dickinson-and-the-culture-of-tolerance">began leading witch-hunts against people like Pax Dickinson and Justine Sacco</a>, getting them fired from their jobs for being un-PC. It’s under Obama that a foreign government—Mexico—has been <a href="http://gotnews.com/mexico-fomenting-riots-america-sanjose/">fomenting riots against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee</a>.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: if Hillary Clinton becomes president, she will kill free speech in America. If you value the freedoms bequeathed to you by the Constitution, you have no choice but to support Donald Trump. His persuasiveness and openly nationalist platform make him the only candidate capable of halting—and possibly reversing—the left’s destruction of our nation.</p>
<h3>Electing A New People</h3>

<p>The dwindling #NeverTrump contingent justifies their refusal to support the Donald on the basis that they’ll be able to come back in 2020 and defeat Hillary after Trump flames out in the general election. This delusional action plan ignores America’s changing demographics. Ever since the Immigration and Naturalization of 1965, the U.S. has become increasingly non-white: as of 2014, <a href="http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/00">only 62.1 percent of Americans are non-Hispanic whites</a>. Demographers project that <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/6/25/whites-on-target-to-become-a-us-minority.html">America will become a minority-majority nation sometime in the next thirty years</a>, with illegal immigration and amnesty worsening the problem.</p>
<p>Latino form the bulk of immigrants to the U.S., and for all the cuckservatives’ claims that they are “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/68170/10-signs-you-might-be-a-cuckservative">natural Republicans</a>,” <a href="http://www.tino.us/2012/11/why-hispanics-are-natural-democrats-and-what-the-gop-can-do-about-it/">Latinos hold leftist views on everything from gun control to taxes to gay marriage</a>. Most Latin American countries are run by socialists or communists who have no respect for free speech: speaking your mind in Brazil, Colombia or Venezuela can result in you being arrested and/or killed. Mexico—where the bulk of Latino immigrants to the U.S. hail from—is <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/21/she-tweeted-against-the-mexican-cartels-they-tweeted-her-murder.html">a failed state run by drug cartels who hunt down and murder anyone who criticizes them</a>.</p>

<p>Latinos monolithically support the Democratic Party, the party that has done more than any other to destroy free speech in America. Even as leftists crow about <a href="http://prospect.org/article/gops-2016-demographic-challenge-even-worse-you-thought">how the growing number of Latinos in America will make it impossible for the Republicans to win national elections</a> in the coming years, cuckservatives labor under the delusion that crossing the Rio Grande will magically transform authoritarian socialists into free-market capitalists.</p>
<p>The same pattern holds in other Western countries with large amounts of non-white immigration. For example, in last year’s federal elections in Canada, Justin Trudeau’s Liberal Party <a href="http://www.vdare.com/articles/paul-ryan-presaged-canadas-conservative-party-elects-a-new-people-which-in-turn-elects-liberal-party-duh">won a majority government largely by swallowing the immigrant vote whole</a>. In every region of the country except for the prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Results_of_the_Canadian_federal_election,_2015#Contributing_factors_to_party_success">the Liberals won the overwhelming majority of constituencies with a visible minority population higher than 26.8 percent</a>. The same goes for other countries: non-whites primarily support Labour in the U.K. (excluding Scotland, where they support the crypto-Marxist SNP), the Socialists in France, and Labor in Australia.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking of voting for Cuckitarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson because Donald Trump makes your pussy hurt, think again. Beyond the fact that all a third-party vote will do is hand the presidency to Hillary, <a href="http://freebeacon.com/politics/johnson-agree-73-percent-sanders/">Johnson has stated that he’s more aligned with Bernie Sanders</a> than any of the other major party candidates remaining. Additionally, in recent years, <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/2012/Gary_Johnson_Immigration.htm">cuckitarians have become militant supporters of open borders and amnesty</a>, and given that immigrants primarily support big government, this will all but ensure the extinction of freedom in America.</p>
<h3>Freedom of Speech… If You Can Keep It</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-88543" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Trump-Supporter-Bloodied-Pearce-Twitter.jpg" alt="Trump-Supporter-Bloodied-Pearce-Twitter" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Trump-Supporter-Bloodied-Pearce-Twitter.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Trump-Supporter-Bloodied-Pearce-Twitter-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Trump-Supporter-Bloodied-Pearce-Twitter-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Trump-Supporter-Bloodied-Pearce-Twitter-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The simple reality is that freedom of speech in America—as well as the other freedoms we take for granted—only came about because the U.S. was founded by whites. Free speech, the rule of law, and the entire framework of our society evolved out of the unique culture of Europe, starting with the ancient Greeks and developed by the theologians of the Reformation and <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/69314/how-john-stuart-mill-demolished-rooshs-feminist-opponents-over-150-years-ago">the philosophers of the Enlightenment</a>. By importing massive numbers of immigrants whose cultures lack these philosophical developments, we’re ensuring that our country becomes more like theirs: less prosperous, less safe and less free.</p>
<p>The only way freedom of speech can be preserved in the U.S. is if whites remain a majority, and Donald Trump is the only candidate who is fighting to ensure this. By building a border wall and cracking down on illegal immigration, Trump will stem the flow of foreigners into America and ensure that the people who founded this country remain in control of it. Hillary Clinton will do the opposite: flood this country with foreign peasants who will give electoral heft to her campaign to destroy freedom in America.</p>
<p>If you value freedom of speech, you can’t afford to spend this election on the sidelines. Whatever his flaws, Trump has established himself as the only man who can preserve America as it is and turn back the tide of cultural Marxist subversion that has defined Obama’s presidency. Even if you have reservations about the man, you need to get out and vote for him: like it or not, he’s your only option. </p>
