<p>The media continues to give radical Islam a pass. Not only are the media blaming gun owners or “<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/06/13/3787606/toxic-masculinity-mass-shooting/">toxic masculinity</a>” rather than ISIS for the unfolding tragedy in Orlando, last week as a horrific story came out from Mosul, Iraq of Yazidi girls as young as 8 years old being imprisoned, caged and burned alive for refusing to become sex slaves, it quickly became evident the death of Harambe the gorilla would end up sparking more public outrage on social media and more genuflecting in the dying (once mainstream) media than misogynistic rape and murder at the hand of religious fanatics. An anonymous witness described the nightmarish scene as the young girls were incinerated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The 19 girls were burned to death, while hundreds of people were watching. Nobody could do anything to save them from the brutal punishment. They were punished for refusing to have sex with ISIS militants.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>(The above photo was circulated by ISIS with claims these young women were burned alive. Some sources say the photo is from a staged protest. Regardless of the veracity of the photo, the story of young sex slaves being incinerated is well documented.)</em></p>
<p>Adding to the issue of this issue not receiving proper attention, it is believed radical Islamists hold an additional 1,800 to 3,500 more sex slaves hostage, with many of the girls aged 10 to 12. Ahmed Amin Koro, a 15-year old Yazidi boy escaped imprisonment and told interviewers what he witnessed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The girls were covering their faces with dirt, trying to make themselves less beautiful. But if they were caught doing that they were beaten. They were all beaten and taken away.</p></blockquote>
<p>The lack of attention to this huge story came despite feminists in Western culture regularly labeling themselves as champions of women and young girls, as they create a culture that chastises, demonizes, and marginalizes men for everything from “microaggressions” to requesting sandwiches from “liberated” women. In the twisted world of American media, even if young females are burned to death by radical Islamists, it does not warrant the same level of outrage as a gorilla death, or even the level of outrage Donald Trump sparked last week after making this mild comment about a judge who is the member of a group that calls itself La Raza or “The Race.”</p>

<blockquote><p>Judge Curiel is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine. But I say he’s got bias.</p></blockquote>
<p>The media was screaming, flopping on the floor, and foaming at the mouth over the tepid Trump comment before the cindered corpses of 19 young girls, true victims of sex crimes and female oppression, had even cooled down. The biases of feminists, leftists, and their marionettes in the media are becoming more obvious, and more worrisome by the day. Here are a few examples of how the bias works based on last week’s events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radical Islamic crimes are not subjected to the same standard of scrutiny as Christian crimes</li>
<li>The media will blame terrorist attacks on gun owners rather than radical Islam</li>
<li>The media cares more about zoo animals than it does young sex slaves being burned to death</li>
<li>Feminists are concerned more with personal power and removing men from their roles in society than actual evil being done against women</li>
<li>Leftists claim to want to live in a world without borders but ignore evil going on outside the U.S.</li>
<li>An activist judge can be a member of a anti-gringo group but a Caucasian Presidential Candidate cannot point out his potential for biasing a high-profile court case</li>
</ul>
<p>Without getting sidetracked on the Trump comments, it is important to point out that even the Marxist Cesar Chavez said La Raza is an anti-gringo group:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hear more and more Mexicans talking about la raza—to build up their pride. Some people don’t look at it as racism, but when you say La Raza, you are saying an anti-gringo thing, and it won’t stop there. Today it’s anti-gringo, tomorrow it will be anti-Negro.<i> </i></p></blockquote>
<p>While discussing media bias, the alphabet networks even went so far as to<a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/07/mob-violence-attacks-astonishing-media-bias-on-display-once-again/"> blame women who support Trump for the violence of Marxist protestors</a> pelting them with eggs. The media also underplayed the fact “migrants” committed 69,000 crimes in Germany alone in the first 3 months of 2016, and <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/13/europes-crime-and-rape-spree-continues-69000-in-3-months/">routinely ignore brutal rape cases or hide the ethnicity of perpetrators</a>.</p>

<p>With the tragedy of young girls being burned alive and the other stunning examples of bias, the cognitive dissonance feminists and leftists continue to demonstrate is breathtaking. It proves that in the liberal hierarchy of concerns, religion trumps feminism, as long as that religion is Islam. It also shows there is and will be more conflict between two groups under the liberal tent: feminists and Islamists.</p>

<h3>The Silence Is Deafening</h3>
<p>Where was the Pope on the matter? President Obama? Hillary, the supposed champion of women? Other world leaders? Prominent feminists? The media? Other than a few short, tepidly written news stories the matter was largely shuffled under the rug and dismissed, except insofar as it helped provide a pretext to keep funneling money into the military-industrial complex. Michelle Obama was apparently too busy complaining about having to live in a White House partially built by slaves, eating French fries and vegetable gardening to take notice of young women being raped and burned alive.</p>
<p>Even more telling, Yazidis are a minority religion which has remnants of Christianity and other religions in it. We all know the Hollyweird, New York Talking Head, and Marxist political operatives in America <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/02/if-god-does-not-exist-anything-is-permitted/">have been decidedly anti-Christian for generations</a>.</p>
<p>Imagine if the situation were reversed: a radical Christian group burned to death 19 Islamic sex slaves. It would receive 24/7 attention and condemnation. CNN would get on its soap box and pontificate over how terrible the oppression of women by burning them to death is until “something is done!” The U.S. would send in SWAT teams and elite units teams to take out the oppressors, as it has done numerous times on its own soil against groups who challenge government tyranny, as when it killed <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/oregon-standoff/2016/03/oregon_standoff_fbi_agents_und.html">LaVoy Finicum</a> in an ambush style attack earlier this year. (FBI storm troopers are now under investigation in the Oregon standoff with Finicum, and the land the family refused to vacate has ties to a Clinton uranium deal.)</p>
<p>When an issue like the rape and murder of young girls by radicals are suppressed or ignored, it implies some level of consent to what is happening by those in power. It also tells us political game players do not really give a damn about moral issues no matter how much preening they do in front of television cameras. The only way they get involved is if the issue means either gaining more personal power, a boost in their public persona, and/or higher approval ratings.</p>
<p>An issue like the murders of sex slaves could also expose leftist hypocrisy and diametrically opposed ideologies (feminism vs. Islamism) in the Democrat tent if it became lodged in the admittedly short memories of <em>fast food and ball games</em> obsessed sheeple. This is why issues like these are never given a lot of air time. Multiculturalism implies tolerance, but it is hard for people to tolerate crimes against humanity like sex slavery and burning people alive. Leftists claim to be champions of women but at the same time tell people not to worry when a religion that oppresses women is increasing in number in Europe and America. Leftists claim multiculturalism will bring about Utopia on earth when in fact people are self-segregating, forming groups like La Raza and Black Lives Matter, and the population of Europe and America grows ever more vivisected and divided.</p>
<p>In short, an issue like one of the liberals’ “protected classes” of people burning sex slaves alive throws the political narrative off to such a degree it will never receive the emphasis it deserves. Just as Hillary claims to be a great champion of women while many of Bill’s former hookups say she tried to shut them up, including a <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/01/18/does-bill-clinton-have-an-illegitmate-son/">black prostitute who claims Bill fathered her biracial son</a>, it is hypocrisy in The Political Game and The Corrupt Media. <span class="st"><em>Four legs good</em>, <em>two legs bad</em></span>, as in George Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm</em>. </p>
