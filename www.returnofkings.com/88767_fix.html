<p>The progressive narrative is that all people are “just like us.” Any differences between different groups of people is the result of racism, colonialism, or bad economic policies. The Islamic terrorist attack on the gay nightclub in Orlando has destroyed that narrative.</p>
<h3>What we know so far</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-88768" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/omar-mateen-300x300.jpeg" alt="omar-mateen" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/omar-mateen.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/omar-mateen-150x150.jpeg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/omar-mateen-262x262.jpeg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>We know that the shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American-born Afghani Muslim. He had been on an FBI watch list in 2013 after he made inflammatory remarks to a coworker and stated that he had terrorist ties. The FBI interviewed Mateen but closed the investigation. He was put on the watch list again in 2014 after he made contact with a person who later became a suicide bomber. Again, the FBI closed the case as being nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Although Mateen’s ex-wife said that he was not particularly religious, his father said that he hated the sight of two men kissing. NBC reports that Mateen called 911 and swore his allegiance to ISIS before he started shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. He also reportedly shouted Allahu Akbar while he was doing the shooting.</p>
<p>Mateen entered the nightclub and started shooting around 2:02 AM. There are some reports that Mateen was wearing a suicide vest. He was armed with a handgun and an assault rifle. The police treated it as a hostage situation but it sounds like Mateen was able to do as he pleased for nearly three hours. SWAT didn’t start shooting until around 5:00 AM. Experts have already pointed out that there are similarities between the terrorist attack on the Bataclan nightclub in Paris and the shooting in Orlando.</p>
<h3>Obama reacts</h3>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn’t he should immediately resign in disgrace!</p>
<p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/742053354189299712">June 12, 2016</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Given that the shooting involved gays and Islam, President Obama had his work cut out for him. His speech writers took a long time to come up with a response. The President was silent until nearly 2:00 PM on Sunday after the massacre.</p>
<p>Obama said that the shooting was being investigated as both a hate crime and an act of terrorism. Predictably, Obama’s biggest criticism was aimed at the Second Amendment:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This massacre is therefore a further reminder of how easy it is for someone to get their hands on a weapon that lets them shoot people in a school, or in a house of worship, or a movie theater, or in a nightclub. And we have to decide if that’s the kind of country we want to be. And to actively do nothing is a decision as well.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama stopped short of calling it an act of Islamic terrorism. This is probably because the shooting pointed out a giant hole in the narrative that President Obama wants to prevail.</p>
<h3>What is the official narrative?</h3>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p>
The Orlando club massacre is a shame, but if I or my supporters got gunned down, gays and their feminist allies would be the first to cheer.</p>
<p>— Roosh (@rooshv) <a href="https://twitter.com/rooshv/status/742020814413910016">June 12, 2016</a>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><script src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>The media, educational institutions, and the government all push one official narrative. On the one side, there are the “good” people who are on the side of progress. These are the gays, transsexuals, furries, atheists, Muslims, Jews, people of color, Hollywood actors, women, feminist men, bronies, and liberal Christians. Any differences between these groups are merely cosmetic. At the end of the day, all of these people are “just like us” regardless of how different their beliefs and practices are. What they mean by “just like us” is that these different groups are all just like liberal, heterosexual, middle class whites.</p>

<p>On the other side there are the “bad” people: Trump supporters, traditional men and women, conservative whites, masculine men, and theologically conservative Christians. You, dear ROK readers, are definitely on the “bad” side because masculinity is bad. Very bad.</p>
<p>The overarching narrative is that the bad people are what spoil it for everybody else. So the Left (and their cuckservative enablers) have led a jihad to minimize the influence of the bad people by importing more people of color, especially Muslims. The thinking is that by importing more good people, the retrograde effect of the bad people could be countered. The terrorist incident at the Orlando gay club has destroyed this whole liberal narrative.</p>
<h3>Islam is not compatible with liberal culture</h3>

<p>The mistake that the non-elite leftists have made is that they have believed their own propaganda. Because religion plays no role in their own lives, leftists believe that it doesn’t play a role in anyone’s life. They can’t imagine that there is a group of people out there that is willing to kill and die for their faith.</p>

<p>Islam is that group of people. Unlike Christianity, which allows men to create laws based on Christian principles, Islam has a strict code called Shariah that it claims is divinely inspired. If it is divinely inspired, it cannot be changed. Unfortunately for liberals, under Shariah law, the penalty for homosexual behavior is death. This is why homosexuals are hurled from the tops of buildings in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Another problem is that Islam views itself as being in a perpetual state of war with all non-Muslims. While Muslims are permitted to live peaceably for a time, it is only until they are able to gather critical mass to mount an offensive against the unbelievers. This is what we are witnessing in Europe and now in the US.</p>
<h3>There are things we can do</h3>
<div id="attachment_88777" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-88777" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051-300x169.jpeg" alt="No, not this." width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051-300x169.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051-768x432.jpeg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051-837x471.jpeg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051-667x375.jpeg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051-262x147.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051-574x323.jpeg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/os-pictures-pulse-nightclub-shooting-orlando-2-051.jpeg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">No, not this.</p>

<p>Every time there is an Islamic terrorist incident, we always get the same response from our leaders: “It is very sad, but there is nothing that could have been done (besides restrict gun ownership for the entire population). Terrorism just happens randomly. Light a candle, hold hands, and wait for the next terrorist incident.” We must no longer allow our politicians to adopt this passive approach. There is almost always something that could be done to close the holes in the system that allowed the terrorist to act.</p>
<p>Islamic terror in the US is often related to a breakdown in US immigration policy. The family of the Boston bombers were admitted to the US under poorly written asylum laws. In her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adios-America-Ann-Coulter/dp/1621572676/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465771586&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Adios+America&amp;tag=rok0f-20"><em>Adios America</em></a>, Ann Coulter describes how the asylum laws are easily abused. Yet neither the Republicans nor the Democrats have lifted a finger to close the asylum loophole.</p>
<p>The situation with Omar Mateen raises similar questions. Mateen was born in the US, but his family is from Afghanistan. According to Pamela Gellar, his father, Seddique Mateen, <a href="http://pamelageller.com/2016/06/orlando-gay-club-jihad-mass-murderers-father-is-taliban-supporter-had-political-islam-tv-show-ran-for-afghan-president.html/">is a supporter of the Taliban who also had a political Islam TV show</a>. The father was running for president in Afghanistan. Why was the Mateen family admitted to the US in the first place? And why was an alleged supporter of the Taliban, the enemy that the US is fighting, permitted to remain in the US?</p>
<p>Once we know the answers to those questions we need to hold our politicians accountable to actually closing the loopholes that allows Islamic terrorists to gain a foothold in the US.</p>
<h3>The current approach to fighting Islamic terror is not sustainable</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-88775" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CkwdXZ5WgAI5mbg-300x200.jpg" alt="CkwdXZ5WgAI5mbg" width="500" height="334" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CkwdXZ5WgAI5mbg-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CkwdXZ5WgAI5mbg-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CkwdXZ5WgAI5mbg-574x383.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CkwdXZ5WgAI5mbg.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The policy of the US when it comes to Islamic terrorism is to pretend that it has no relation to Islam. Thus, the US continues to import Muslims. But, each new Muslim arrival increases the threat of Islamic terror. To counter that threat, the US steps up surveillance, but to ensure it is not profiling, it increases surveillance of all citizens. One of the shocking revelations that came out of the Edward Snowden affair is that the vast majority of the information gathered on innocent US citizens has no relation to terrorism.</p>
<p>But it is impossible to watch everyone. Real threats, like Omar Mateen, will drop off the radar. As long as there is a large Muslim presence in the US, a certain percentage of terror attacks will get through. This approach is unsustainable. It is not possible to keep increasing the surveillance state and to keep increasing the Islamic population in the US. The only solution is to curb Islamic immigration. Donald Trump’s proposed ban on new Muslim immigration would go a long way of stopping the problem from getting even worse. Deporting known terrorist sympathizers would also help.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Leftist narrative that everyone is “just like us” has been destroyed but don’t expect the masses to understand this. Our government and media elites will double down on the narrative and use this tragic incident as an excuse to grab yet more power and control.</p>
<p>Still, at least some people are going to realize that the narrative is a lie. They will become our allies as we set out to create a healthy nation.</p>
