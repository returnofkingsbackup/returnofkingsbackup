<p>I recently bought Roosh’s new book, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Free-Speech-Isnt-Globalist-Establishment-ebook/dp/B01GMQZ5ZA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468972674&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Free+SPeech+Isn%27t+Free#nav-subnav&amp;tag=rok0f-20" target="_blank">Free Speech Isn’t Free</a></em>, for a multitude of reasons.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I was very interested in learning exactly what happened to him in Canada. Like most of the ROK community, I’ve read <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/69013/how-roosh-v-won-the-battle-of-montreal" target="_blank">various articles</a> describing his experience, but there was no one, big compilation of all of the events; until this eBook.</p>
<p>The second reason, which I would like to be the main focus of this article, was that I wanted to support him. We are coming to a point in time where we have to start voting with our dollars. By buying Roosh’s new book, I’m playing a small role in supporting him. A small, yet integral role, that will allow him to continue producing content, spreading neomasculine principles, and exposing the SJW’s for what they are.</p>
<p>There are many ways that you can support the manosphere, but I’d like to elaborate a bit on why we need to support each other, first.</p>
<h3>Why You Need to Support The Manosphere</h3>
<p>I want to ask you a question, and hopefully it will send chills down your spine. If Roosh didn’t make enough money to support himself from ROK, what would have happened when he tried to give those speeches?</p>
<p>Really think about this, for a second. What would’ve happened? He would’ve been fired from his job, the media would’ve absolutely ruined his reputation, and he would’ve LITERALLY ended up homeless on the streets where some SJW gang would probably beat him to death. This is not an exaggeration.</p>

</div>
<p>You men need to understand that we live in a time of unprecedented publicity. Any controversial idea or concept that you present can, and oftentimes will, be used against you. Roosh realized this harsh truth upon having the full force of the liberal, biased Canadian media come down on him.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about Roosh, however—it’s not even just about the bloggers and columnists here at ROK. It’s about the man who gets <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/17666/canadian-feminist-kyla-garvey-gets-two-firemen-fired" target="_blank">fired from his job</a> for tweeting jokes. It’s about the man who gets <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/67257/woman-demands-7-million-for-feelings-hurt-working-at-london-bank" target="_blank">sued for $18 million</a> for flirting with a girl. It’s about the man who gets falsely accused of rape and has his entire social circle isolate him.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re all vulnerable. If you don’t think you’re vulnerable, ask yourself: if a feminist were to gain access to everything you’ve ever said or posted on social media, would you be fucked? Even if the answer is no, you’re NOT safe from a false rape accusation, which I learned so very clearly during my first year at college.</p>
<h3>If We Don’t Help One Another, Nobody Will</h3>
<p><img class=" wp-image-67579" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/size0-army.mil-57896-2009-12-07-081256-300x218.jpg" alt="Everyone carries their own load in Ranger school - at least for now." width="365" height="265" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/size0-army.mil-57896-2009-12-07-081256-300x218.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/size0-army.mil-57896-2009-12-07-081256-262x190.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/size0-army.mil-57896-2009-12-07-081256-574x416.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/size0-army.mil-57896-2009-12-07-081256.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px"></p>
<p>I hope that I have made it abundantly clear that we are all at risk here. This isn’t some isolated incident, this isn’t just about the bloggers and columnists that encourage men to be masculine, this is about EVERYONE.</p>
<p>If the men of the manosphere don’t start supporting one another, then who will? Nobody. And when the feminists come knocking on your door demanding that you compensate them for their “hurt feelings,” what are you going to do? How will you pay for the lawsuits and irreparable social circle damage when you can’t even find a job, because you have a false rape accusation on record?</p>
<p>As Roosh so eloquently put in <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/88075/the-resistance-pyramid-a-strategy-for-men-to-defend-themselves-and-fight-back" target="_blank">this article</a>, the first thing you should be doing is improving yourself. That’s a no-brainer, and if you’re not doing this you’re fucking up big time. Work on your emotional health, <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1122" target="_blank">learn game</a>, work out, and study self-development.</p>
<p>The second thing you must do, however, is develop financial independence. And you cannot do this if the HR feminists at your job are crooning over your every movement, desperate to find some sort of “sexist” comment or action to attack. If your financial success depends on somebody else who isn’t in the manosphere, you are not safe. Period.</p>
<p>Case in point: I was fired from my job about five months ago because I was too assertive. It isn’t a coincidence that my workplace consisted of seven women and one other man (who was the boyfriend of the boss). Do you see the hypocrisy here?</p>
<p>How the fuck can a man get fired for being “too assertive”? And how can a woman hire seven women and only two men, but when a man hires three women and five men, he’s subject to legal action.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense, and that’s the point—radical “revenge-on-daddy” feminists don’t give a shit about the facts, they’re just angry at men and want them to suffer. This is why you are not safe, no matter how safe you feel.</p>
<h3>So What Do We Do?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-67090" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy-300x300.jpg" alt="swissarmy" width="300" height="300" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy-300x300.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy-150x150.jpg 150w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy-837x837.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy-667x667.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy-262x262.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy-574x574.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/07/swissarmy.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>First and foremost, you should be setting up passive income. I’ll be writing more on my blog about this in the future, but I have several sources of passive revenue (including the <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1239" target="_blank">stock market</a>) that I’m working on, and when I was aggressively building them (back in February, before I began writing a lot of content for my blog), I was earning an average of $75 per day in passive income. You can do this too, if you put in the work.</p>
<p>But we need to go beyond just helping ourselves. How do we help one another, and speed up the process towards us developing financial independence? I propose that we create a “manosphere economy,” of sorts. This will consist of us all supporting one another and our various financial endeavors to the point that we don’t need to rely on feminists and over-sensitive HR departments for our jobs.</p>
<p>There’s a few ways that we can all accomplish this goal. One of the most obvious ways is to start buying each others’ e-books. You’re going to buy books anyways, aren’t you? So why not buy a book and support the manosphere at the same time?</p>
<p>This option is limited, however—it’s only applicable to the bloggers in the manosphere. What can you do to help the every day man? How can you help yourself? How can you develop financial independence and support your brothers in arms in our quest for neomasculine virtues?</p>
<p>It’s simple—if you have any sort of job that you require, have a member of the manosphere do it. That’s it.</p>
<p>You need a plumber to come in and fix your sink? Check out your local plumber’s offices and see which one is the least “SJW.” Actually talk to the men and get to know them. Tell them that you want a “regular plumber,” for any time something breaks down. Even if they don’t actively read articles in the manosphere, it’s better to support a hard-working, masculine man than some huge plumbing company with a giant HR department.</p>

<p>Not only will this give more money to men who actually deserve it and will use it responsibly (buying things of value, and not frivolous impulse buys like a lot of women partake in), but you’ll also develop a business relationship with a hard-working, masculine man. I’m sure that he’d be willing to give you a discount if he’s your regular guy, so you’ll end up saving money, too.</p>
<p>Or maybe you need a graphic designer? Ask around on the manosphere and see if anyone does freelancing services like this. Whether it’s for a logo for an e-book cover or for blog design, all of these services can be done remotely.</p>
<p>Even if you just want to buy food, don’t buy it from Safeway, Giant, or some other huge “equal employer.” Buy it from your local farmers’ market, so that you can support the hard-working, masculine men of your community.</p>
<h3>A Call To Action</h3>
<p>I’ve had this idea for a while now, but I’m still working on integrating it. I want to start a networking forum for men of the manosphere to post jobs on and help each other out with various services.</p>
<p>You need a mechanic? Maybe there’s one right down the street from you who reads ROK, but you don’t even know it yet.</p>
<p>Or maybe you’re a young buck looking for a job? Perhaps one of the more financially accomplished gentlemen of the ROK community owns a business in your area, and I’m sure he’d be willing to hire a young man who embodies the principles of neomasculinity.</p>
<p>Do you see the point here? If we can start networking as a community, just as the SJW’s have been doing for the last several decades, we will become a powerful force to be reckoned with.</p>
<div id="attachment_89080" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-89080" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/circle1.jpg" alt="When men stand united, they become an indomitable force." width="500" height="325" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/circle1.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/circle1-300x195.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/circle1-262x170.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/circle1-574x373.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">When men stand united, they become an indomitable force.</p>
</div>
<p>No longer will men have to worry about being in financial ruin over some stupid comment, or because you flirted with a girl and she got “uncomfortable.” Finally, men will be able to speak their minds and act as they want.</p>
<p>This will be the beginning of the end. Once men can start to reclaim financial independence and publicly speak their minds without fear of financial destruction, more and more men will come out of the woodwork, unafraid of also speaking their minds. We will set an example for all men to follow, and begin to bring back the masculine values that our nation so desperately needs.</p>
<p>We don’t just WANT<em> </em>this to happen. We NEED this to happen.</p>
<h3>SJW’s Have Been Doing This For Decades</h3>
<p>“Wait—you said that SJW’s have been doing this for the last several decades. What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>Yes, they have. And the fact that most men don’t even realize this goes to show you just how powerful their brainwashing tactics are. When a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1uzwf6/women_in_the_workplace_an_allfemale_distaster/" target="_blank">female boss only hires women</a>, what do you think she’s doing? When a female boss only hires <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1088">men who are effeminate and weak</a>, what do you think she’s doing? When an SJW in the HR department screens every applicant for a hint of rationality, and fires them if they’re too logical, what do you think she’s doing?</p>
<p>She’s only hiring people who confirm to her political ideology. That’s what she’s doing.</p>
<div id="attachment_89081" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-89081" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06-devil1.jpg" alt='"He made you feel UNCOMFORTABLE, you say?"' width="500" height="297" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06-devil1.jpg 620w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06-devil1-300x178.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06-devil1-262x156.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/06-devil1-574x341.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">“You’re a feminist activist, you say? YOU’RE HIRED!”</p>
</div>
<p>Men need to start doing the same. Once we start unifying, and helping other men with the same political ideologies as ourselves, we will be an incredibly powerful force to reckon with. In fact, I predict that once this happens (which it will, it’s just a matter of time), the feminist fortress that was previously impregnable will come crumbling down within a matter of two decades.</p>
<h3>“But isn’t this illegal? Won’t I get sued?”</h3>
<p>You may in fact get sued if you’re a major player in this game (as Roosh is), but anybody with a basic knowledge of the law can get around the majority of legal troubles that may arise from helping your fellow man.</p>
<p>You have a business, and want to hire young, masculine men to support the future patriarchs, but are worried about “equal employment” officers giving you shit?</p>
<p>Or maybe you want to only buy services from men who are members of the manosphere, but are worried about the ramifications?</p>
<p>Or maybe you even want to start an all male company, without an HR department (GASP).</p>
<p>All of these things can easily be done if you just understand one simple concept: independent contractor.</p>
<p>Companies have been using the “independent contractor” guise for decades now to get away with not paying their employees benefits, and a whole host of other things that are normally required by law.</p>
<p>In essence, being an independent contractor is when you aren’t technically “employed,” but you’re independently “hired” to perform a certain service. Even though there’s virtually no difference between these two concepts, if you file as an “independent contractor,” you can avoid 99% of legal troubles.</p>
<p>Why? Because independent contractors don’t fall under the equal employment laws.</p>
<h3>“I’m an independent contractor!”</h3>
<p>You own an all male company and some equal opportunity lawyer threatens to sue you? “Oh, sorry miss—these are all independent contractors. That means I’m <a href="https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/how-start-business/business-types/self-employed-independent-contractors" target="_blank">not liable</a> to enforce equal opportunity laws :)”</p>

No, no, no – you don’t understand! They’re independent contractors!</p>
</div>
<p>Your business consist of only male clients? It doesn’t matter—you’re not required to perform services for people you don’t want to (yet). You only hire independently employed blue-collar men? Who cares? That’s not illegal. Once the manosphere starts to realize this simple legal loophole, we will accomplish amazing things.</p>
<h3>Take Action!</h3>
<p>Eventually, if we all start following the advice that I’ve outlined, the manosphere will become its own economic entity. Do you realize how powerful this is?</p>
<p>Now, all of a sudden, we’re impermeable—it doesn’t matter if we flirt with a girl and make her feel “uncomfortable,” (although obviously you should still try to learn game and not be creepy). It doesn’t matter if one of us posts a mean comment on twitter or even writes an entire article on hobbies that get you laid, because we’ll still be able to support ourselves.</p>
<p>Once this happens, it will be a beautiful thing. All of the men who were afraid of speaking out in their workplace, and who got fired for a co-worker who cried rape, will no longer have to suffer. We’ll be able to expose this hyper-liberal madness for what it is. This will be the beginning of the end of he cancer which has been slowly rotting our culture from the inside out.</p>
<p>When my blog gets big enough, I’m hoping to hire social media interns and affiliate program managers from the manosphere, so that I can not only employ like-minded men, but also teach them the lessons I’ve learned from my life. Roosh does the same—who do you think is the editor at ROK? Who do you think combs through the rough drafts that authors like I submit, and proof-reads them to ensure grammatical precision? Some feminazi bitch? No way. His name is Winston and he’s a member of the manosphere just like me, and just like you.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on integrating a forum into my blog so that men of the manosphere can network more easily, but for now, consider posting jobs on the <a href="https://www.rooshvforum.com/forum-14.html" target="_blank">RooshV Lifestyle Forum</a> or leaving a comment below. Every job that you give another man in the manosphere is a small, yet impactful step towards us having economic freedom and FINALLY conquering the scourge of third wave feminism.</p>
<p>I’ve done my part, now it’s your turn.</p>
