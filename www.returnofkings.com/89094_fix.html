<p>Most men, even if they’re still swimming in ocean of blue pills, have some awareness that something has gone awry with the relationship between men and women. Statistics prove this as well as divorce has been epidemic for a while now with record-number of children growing up with single parent around the world while young people are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/18/why-generation-y-less-sex">having less sex than before</a>. And whether you be a feminist or part of the manosphere, I think both sides can agree on one thing: that a war between the sexes have been heating up in the recent years.</p>
<p>Why is all this happening? While men and women tend to play the blame game to avoid taking any responsibility, there are greater forces at play. The fact is, the continuing transformation of our society is making the antagonism between the sexes inevitable. Feminism is just a symptom, not the cause of our problems.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89119" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/177808064-100249448-primary.idge_.jpg" alt="177808064-100249448-primary.idge" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/177808064-100249448-primary.idge_.jpg 620w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/177808064-100249448-primary.idge_-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/177808064-100249448-primary.idge_-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/177808064-100249448-primary.idge_-574x382.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Before we look at why today’s sex relations are in a dismal state, consider the single factor that makes relationships prosper: Mutuality based on different but compatible roles.</p>
<p>All relationships work best when two parties have something different to share for their mutual benefit. For example, humans and horses have enjoyed a close relationship together throughout history (unlike, say, humans and bears). The relationship works because in exchange for food, protection, and care that humans provide, the horses offer themselves as transportation.</p>
<p>The relationship between men and women was also mutually beneficial for the entirety of human existence with men offering their services in exchange for having the women bear their children. But now, with the advent of modern society and its conditions, things have changed drastically.</p>
<h3>1. “Equality”</h3>
<div id="attachment_89120" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-89120" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine.jpg" width="500" height="357" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine.jpg 1000w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine-300x214.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine-768x548.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine-837x598.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine-667x476.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine-262x187.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/picjacksonwalkermine-574x410.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">At least these men had their male privilege.</p>
</div>
<p>“Equality” for women is the most abominable lie to have ever perpetuated on mankind.</p>
<p>Men have always provided for women. Men hunted for food, labored to build everything, and fought battles to defend their tribe. To say that men oppressed women throughout history is an insult to all those who sacrificed themselves in the factories, the coal mines, and the trenches. If women didn’t have certain rights that feminists like to cherry-pick, it’s because women weren’t drafted to fight wars. In exchange for their toil, the only thing men asked of women was to be supportive in their roles as wives and mothers.</p>
<p>But fast-forward to today, now that women have “achieved” social and political “equality” and even various advantages just for being born a female, many women today no longer feel that it’s necessary to exchange values with men for mutuality. It’s like when humans developed automobiles and didn’t need horses anymore. The difference is, humans and horses don’t <em>need </em>to be together; men and women do.</p>
<p>However, men’s sexual desire—which is greater than that of females—is still alive and kicking. So what we have today is a situation where women have gotten their social equality while sexual inequality persists for men (which is why many men choose to give up sex entirely to level the playing field). This is what happens when you standardize human beings into economic units.</p>
<h3>2. Education and career over family</h3>
<div id="attachment_89121" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-89121 size-full" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_182849096.jpg" width="500" height="332" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_182849096.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_182849096-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shutterstock_182849096-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Stressed out from balancing between work and family? Yup, it’s the men’s fault that you tried to do both.</p>
</div>
<p>To maintain their advantage over men, women today are dedicating themselves to their education and career. Western women, in particular, have been so thoroughly sold on the idea of status and consumerist orgy that they are no longer interested in relationships. More and more women today are delaying marriage (if not outright rejecting it). And when they do get married, they are using it as a means to trap men into donating their sperm and cash, only to bail out when they want to.</p>
<h3>3. Slut culture</h3>
<div id="attachment_89126" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

I’m sure your failed parents are just as proud.</p>
</div>
<p>The advent of contraception and the decimation of whatever feminine decency that was left has turned the vast majority of young Western women into drunken sluts. The increasing number of sluts is diminishing the availability of quality women that men want to start a family with and has <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/76414/8-ways-women-destroy-themselves-and-everyone-else-by-sleeping-around">social implications</a> for the society as a whole.</p>
<h3>4. Government supplanting men</h3>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>The only way women were able to “liberate” themselves from their supposed oppressors was by latching themselves on to a new alpha provider: the government. As said before, men form relationships with women by exchanging values, with his strength to provide and protect being his greatest asset. But now, the government (along with corporations and education system) fulfills those roles that men previously occupied. And not only that, but the government is deeply involved in the affairs of marriage, sending professional white-knights to extort and arrest men who’ve been used up and thrown away by women.</p>
<p>It also doesn’t help that the government is increasingly monopolizing violence, one of the most important value that a man possesses. And that leads to my next point.</p>
<h3>5. Too few wars, too many men</h3>
<div id="attachment_89123" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-89123" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Samurai.jpeg" alt="Samurai" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Samurai.jpeg 510w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Samurai-300x225.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Samurai-262x196.jpeg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">I doubt these men had to think of ways to entertain women like a monkey to get their attention.</p>
</div>
<p>The recurring theme across patriarchal societies of the past and present are violence and warfare. And the most commonly associated traits of masculinity are also traits of warriors such as strength, bravery, aggression, discipline, and so on. It’s quite simple: the more violent the environment is, the more masculine men become. And the more conflicts and wars there are, the more the women depend on men—thus keeping the collective value of male population high.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that Western societies have started to feminize as they endured decades of relative peace since the end of WWII. The lack of warfare also means that there are now more young men per woman (practically 1 to 1) than there normally would have been under a warring society. Excess of men—who are also emasculated and feminized—means that the collective value of average men has dropped to a historical low, upsetting the balance of sexual marketplace in the process. Only the top 5-10% of men with the warrior traits and wealth are able to enjoy a semblance of a balanced relationship with women—and even they have to play the game.</p>
<h3>6. The decimation of Western women</h3>
<div id="attachment_89128" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-89128" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img2.thejournal.ie_.jpeg" width="500" height="338" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img2.thejournal.ie_.jpeg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img2.thejournal.ie_-300x203.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img2.thejournal.ie_-262x177.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/img2.thejournal.ie_-574x388.jpeg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Declining marriage rates? Don’t worry, some simps will try to put a ring on their fingers.</p>
</div>
<p>Many Western women have been corrupted by our toxic materialist society. They are fatter, uglier, more narcissistic, more entitled, hedonistic, superficial, less faithful, and seem to think that having bitch attitude makes them hip. Women can afford to stoop low because their sex drive isn’t the same as men’s, while they couldn’t care less for love and companionship when they’re too busy with their travels and careers.</p>
<p>And because of all the thirsty men, women’s collective sexual market value hardly suffers while the value of those who are merely average becomes inflated beyond their real value. You only need to check out the gross discrepancies between the sexes in dating sites and apps to see how bad things are.</p>
<h3>7. Anti-male culture</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89125" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida.jpg" width="500" height="286" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida.jpg 850w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida-300x172.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida-768x439.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida-837x479.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida-667x381.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida-262x150.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/divorce-court-tv-show-florida-574x328.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Men are all rapists waiting to be hatched out of their facade, men merely uttering a word to a woman is a harassment, men are always “mansplaining” to women, men are insecure cry-babies, men open their legs too much when they sit, men and their toxic masculinity need to be controlled, men have to do more for women, men are dominating in tech fields because of sexism, men shouldn’t say this, men shouldn’t do that, etc, etc… And of course, if men push back, they’re “misogynists.”</p>
<p>And we’re we still wondering why relationships are getting harder to form these days?</p>
<h3>8. Lack of shared values</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89129" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family_2076065b.jpg" width="500" height="313" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family_2076065b.jpg 620w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family_2076065b-300x188.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family_2076065b-262x164.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family_2076065b-574x359.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>As social beings, we humans need more than economic incentives and passions to form a relationship for a family to prosper. There must be shared values.</p>
<p>With traditional family values under constant attack from all directions, the bonding between males and females have been reduced to mere hook-ups and economic unions. To make matters worse, many from both sides are resorting to predatory behaviors to exploit one another for either money (for women) or sex (for men), augmenting the distrust between the two sexes. Others, who either don’t want to play games or have become overtly hostile to the opposite sex, have given up on relationships entirely. This is the end result of atomization and extreme individualism under a system that destroys all values for the sake of economic advancement.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89130" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/woman-man-1.jpg" width="500" height="375" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/woman-man-1.jpg 620w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/woman-man-1-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/woman-man-1-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/woman-man-1-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>The destruction of sex relationship is having a negative effect on society as a whole and is transforming the demographic landscape of many Western nations. Unlike what the aesthetically-challenged feminists and the man-children crying their own way believe, men and women are not adversaries. You don’t have to be a traditionalist to see that the sex relations have gone awry due to the development of modern society and its destructive cultures.</p>
<p>Many Western men have already checked out or gone out to find traditional women elsewhere. But that is merely adapting to the situation; it doesn’t solve the problem at a societal level. The continuing antagonism of the sexes will eventually spread around the world. Unless the current course is somehow reversed, we can only wait and see how far the damage will run its course.</p>
