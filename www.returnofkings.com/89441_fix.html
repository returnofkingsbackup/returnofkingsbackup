<p>The sacred immigrant is held up by leftists as an example of the Diversity™ and Multiculturalism™ they cherish. In the United States, Inc. the immigrant is implied to have the Superior Virtue of the Oppressed by the mainstream media and politicians. By default, they’re better people than those Evil White Males™ who drag their knuckles, thump their chests, and disenfranchise and oppress people. If only the white male go away, shut up, or better yet, go extinct the rainbow of people in the New America and New World Order could finally<em> just get along</em>.</p>
<p>There are many holes in the left’s grand narrative of diversity and multiculturalism, however, such as the juxtaposition of the <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/24/female-circumcision-on-the-rise-in-the-west/">practice of cutting the clitoris off young girls increasing in the West alongside rabid feminists</a> who regularly castigate and verbally castrate Western Beta males for nothing more than the crime of existing, having a penis, and having normal sexual desire. Christophobic feminists regularly contradict the left’s multiculturalism narrative as they swoop in to Muslim countries to stop the “diverse” practice of female circumcision while ignoring the hypocrisy of pushing Western feminism on other cultures.</p>
<p>While in the West the practice of removing the clitoris is viewed with horror, in many Middle Eastern and African nations it is a cultural practice that goes back at least 2,000 years and is supported by 75% of women in nations like Guinea. Not to mention ignoring the ongoing brutality of male circumcision in their own countries, proving men don’t count for anything to Western women other than the brute labor and material goodies they can provide. Which will it be for the left? Respecting diversity or enforcing Western feminism on Muslims?</p>
<p>Focusing on out-of-control immigration, which is the reason why we are seeing odd couples like feminists and supporters of Sharia Law side by side under the leftist tent, when looking at today’s immigrants one begins noticing many of them behave as an invading force rather than someone who has superior virtue, only wishing to quietly assimilate into the culture and become an integral part of it. Leftists, always coming up with clever word jumbles tell us we have “progressed” past the need for a melting pot, that we have turned into a salad bowl in the 21st century. Each ethnic piece of lettuce, tomato, broccoli, and ranch dressing can now retain its own unique flavor while enlightening and loving each other. That’s the fantasy.</p>
<p>The reality is quite different as the rise of female circumcision in feminized Western nations shows. In another show of tribal behavior that won’t go away, Mexican groups in particular waved Mexican flags as they beat up Donald Trump supporters in San Jose and other Trump rallies for having a difference of opinion. At protests, virtuous immigrants can also be seen waving the flags of their homeland rather than the flag of their adoptive nation, which they sometimes burn in protest. These are the actions of conquerors, not loving immigrants. Examining the differences between the two types of house guest helps shed some light on the why this behavior is occurring.</p>
<h3>Immigrants</h3>

<img class=" wp-image-89463" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants-300x209.jpg" alt="Immigrants respect the laws and customs of the nations they're entering" width="462" height="322" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants-300x209.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants-768x534.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants-837x582.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants-667x464.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants-262x182.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Immigrants-574x399.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Immigrants respect the laws and customs of the nations they’re entering</p>
</div>
<p>Immigrants come to a new land to flee conditions or oppression in their homeland. Immigrants want to assimilate and become part of the culture they are immigrating to, learning the language, adopting the customs, and following the behaviors of their new home, while swearing allegiance to the new nation. Importantly, they leave their old nation behind, letting it go.</p>
<p>Some interesting immigration stats show us what a welcoming land America actually is to immigrants (not invaders). It is not the land of pitchfork yielding, tobacco-spitting rubes media types paint it to be: the U.S. is home to a full 1/5 of the entire world’s total of immigrants. (As an aside, thanks to marketing and imagery from film and media that depicts it in a positive light, even as it devolves into an authoritarian police state, the United States remains the top choice of people worldwide who want to immigrate but can’t.)</p>
<p>Immigrants abide by laws and come into the country legally, they don’t break in, pop a squat and tell everyone else how racist they are while shoving the cultural mores of the country they left behind in everyone’s face. But, to a large extent that’s exactly how immigration to American works in the 21st century. The country is devolving into a Tower of Babel and an ethnically segregated nation—not because that’s policy but because people naturally self-segregate. People want to be around people that look like them and share their values, by and large, and that includes immigrants.</p>
<p>Classic waves of immigrants, the kind that helped transform America into an economic superpower <em>would rather throw themselves off a fire escape than go on welfare </em>according to conservative commentator Michael Savage, whose father was an immigrant from Russia. (We will see this mentality, along with all the other mentalities of immigrants have been turned on their head in the invaders section.)</p>
<p>Further, a long instituted system of preferring European immigrants worked, and helped maintain the Western culture America is based on, that is, until 1965 when a fresh faced young Senator from Massachusetts pushed a bill that its supporters said would not demographically or culturally change America, causing the very problems we are seeing 50 years later. A few years before Chappaquiddick, Ted Kennedy told this blatant lie to the American people:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, our cities will not be flooded with a million immigrants annually. Under the proposed bill, the present level of immigration remains substantially the same. Secondly, the ethnic mix of this country will not be upset. Contrary to the charges in some quarters, [the bill] will not inundate America with immigrants from any one country or area, or the most populated and deprived nations of Africa and Asia. In the final analysis, the ethnic pattern of immigration under the proposed measure is not expected to change as sharply as the critics seem to think. The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Each one of those claims can be struck down, as our cities are regularly inundated with government dependent immigrants we can no longer support, white countries are told to bend over and worship diversity, that they are not allowed to have an identity, and the middle class is destroyed by jobs moving overseas thanks to free trade agreements and immigrants suppressing wages. Today’s immigrants have turned into the equivalent of invaders, looking for a piece of the dwindling pie as Western nations sink under the weight of their own decadence, ignorance, and demographic displacement.</p>
<h3>Invaders</h3>

</div>
<p>An invading force enters a land not with the purpose of assimilating, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/19/three-minutes-to-midnight-for-western-civilization/">but conquering the nations they enter and forcing everyone else to abide by their cultural practices</a>. In the past, this was accomplished by an invading army fighting a war. Today, it is accomplished by people coming through the back door (or even the front door) as they hurl every type of insult they can at those whose land they are entering. Invaders come for generous government benefits, not to become an integrated part of the society. Unlike most nations in which one must demonstrate financial solvency before they’re allowed into a country as an immigrant, people who are likely to become wards of the state are allowed in the U.S. on a regular basis.</p>

<p>Thumbing their nose at those who insist they learn the language of the land while refusing to respect an already tolerant culture, invaders do what they want and tell traditional Americans to hell with your culture. Up to 90% of today’s immigrants come from cultures that have never been fully assimilated into our modern polyglot boarding house Theodore Roosevelt warned about a century ago. In State of Emergency, Pat Buchanan shows us a historical parallel of what happened to Roman society when weak leaders had “compassion” for invaders rather than backbone.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 376 AD, a large band of Gothic refugees arrives at the Empire’s Danube frontier, asking for asylum. In a complete break with established Roman policy, they were allowed in, unsubdued. They revolted, and within two years had defeated and killed the emperor Valens – the one who had received them. What Valens had done was the Christian thing to do, but it had never been the Roman thing to do. Valens has his modern counterpart in George W. Bush. For in May 2006, Republican senators at Bush’s urging joined Democrats to offer a blanket amnesty to 12 million illegal aliens and permit US businesses to go abroad and bring in foreign workers. Senators had been shocked by the millions of Hispanics marching in America’s cities under Mexican flags. And as was the emperor Valens, President Bush was hailed for his compassion and vision.</p></blockquote>
<p>As seen with emperor Valens, the scenario of immigrants displacing traditional populations <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/spenglers-civilization-model/">often plays out in the final chapters of a civilization</a>. Mark Steyn also made this chillingly prescient prediction a full decade ago, then scoffed at by the left then but ironically playing out in front of their television cameras a decade later.</p>
<blockquote><p>To avoid collapse, European nations will need to take in immigrants at a rate no stable society has ever attempted… Most people reading this have strong stomachs, so let me lay it out as baldly as I can: Much of what we loosely call the Western world will not survive this century, and much of it will effectively disappear within our lifetimes, including many if not most Western European countries. There’ll probably still be a geographical area on the map marked as Italy or the Netherlands–probably–just as in Istanbul there’s still a building called St. Sophia’s Cathedral. But it’s not a cathedral; it’s merely a designation for a piece of real estate. Likewise, Italy and the Netherlands will merely be designations for real estate. The challenge for those who reckon Western civilization is on balance better than the alternatives is to figure out a way to save at least some parts of the West.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the left labels immigrants as hard workers, and many of them may be, statistics tell otherwise. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, over half of households headed up by an immigrant are on some form of social welfare assistance. Immigrants from Central America and Mexico have the highest incidence of using public assistance, as a whopping 73% of those households are on public assistance. Immigrants from Europe and Southeast Asia have the lowest rates of welfare use.</p>
<p>Beyond using public assistance while making fun of traditional Americans’ and Europeans’ disenfranchisement from their own countries, there are splinter movements forming which want to “take back” the Southwest U.S. and return it to Mexico. This is called the Aztlan movement or the Reconquista, the re-conquest. Jose Guttierrez, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington told reporters his views, which echo many in La Raza (The Race):</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not our fault that whites don’t make babies, and blacks are not growing in sufficient numbers, and there’s no other groups with such a goal to put their homeland back together again. We do. Those numbers will make it possible. I believe that in the next few years, we will see an irredentists movement, beyond assimilation, beyond integration, beyond separatism, to putting Mexico back together as one. That’s irridentism. One Mexico, one nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, in 2016, 3 out of every 4 babies born in Texas are non-white. The demographic re-conquest is already well advanced. Similar demographic tales can be seen in other Southwestern states, especially California.</p>
<h3>Ethnic Blender</h3>

<p>The solution of Western governments in their quest for Utopia, rather than trying to maintain the cultural and demographic integrity of the people and constitutions they are sworn to protect, is to put us all into an ethnic blender, removing our humanity as they steadily work towards creating a <em>standardized human being</em>, a literally interchangeable corporate cog, bereft of humanity, politically correct, debased from history, with no sense of identity. Economic interests also want to create standardized corporate cogs of economic production with people rather than respecting the biology and humanity of the messy, freethinking, free-acting individual. So, they encourage even more immigration so as to drown out dissent from those whose identity and culture are being destroyed. All the while, diversity destroys true diversity as all world cultures converge into one socially engineered mass of well-trained and indoctrinated consumers.</p>
<p>The solution to the problem of Western nations needing so many immigrants was actually quite simple:<em> it’s the birth rates, stupid.</em> <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/30/jd-unwin-detailed-how-feminism-would-destroy-culture-30-years-before-womens-lib/">Feminism and secularism destroyed Western fertility</a>, while the consumption economy needs a religious society’s birth rate (not a secular, suicidal birth rate) to keep it running. The fact is religious people have children, secular people do not. It was the blunder of all time. Or was it a plan?</p>
<p>This demographic problem has been creeping up on the U.S. and Europe for generations. However, whether for personal gains or private agendas, this issue of population replacement was never put before Americans or Europeans. It would have been as simple as telling people <em>Hey, you guys might want to reproduce if you want your culture and genetics to survive. </em>This fundamental error shifted the balance of power so far that “immigrants” no longer need to come in with the promise of assimilation.</p>
<p>Rather, they’re acting much in the way conquerors would, and for good reason. The consumption economy needs them, the globalists want them to drown out dissent from the middle class who they are enslaving and reducing to a permanent underclass, and creating division among ethnic groups fighting with each other for government favors aggrandizes power in the hands of the elite.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe social engineers and financiers did not see this issue coming without making plans to capitalize on it. </p>
