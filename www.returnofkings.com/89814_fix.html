<p>It is done. You have found the least damaged and slutty girl you could find that also looks like you. She passed all the loyalty tests and the seed has taken root. But the future is bleak and many challenges lie ahead of your progeny.</p>
<p>Elites and media cannot wait to put their gender-fluid sausage-fingered paws on your children and format their young brains. It is your role to shield them from that peril and here is a non-exhaustive list that can help you in that task.</p>
<h3>1. Be present</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89828" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family-436831_1280-600x450.jpg" alt="family-436831_1280-600x450" width="401" height="301" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family-436831_1280-600x450.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family-436831_1280-600x450-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family-436831_1280-600x450-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family-436831_1280-600x450-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px"></p>
<p>As simple as that. Be there. Listen to them. Spot the early signs of SJW friendly attitude and nip them in the bud. A girl with an absent father, like a ship with no rudder, will turn to an ocean of cocks. A boy with an absent father will turn to crime, or worse, feminism.</p>
<p>Keep them close in their formative years. You are a rock, an example. Live by what you preach. There is only so much you can do. The idea here is to create a strong, independent mind that will be curious, hard to manipulate and ready to question the pre-conceived ideas that the exterior world will feed them.</p>
<h3>2. Find the ideal environment</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89827" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing.jpg" alt="seed-growing" width="403" height="207" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing.jpg 897w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing-300x154.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing-768x395.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing-837x430.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing-667x343.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing-262x135.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/seed-growing-574x295.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px"></p>
<p>It starts by choosing the right mate. More on that <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/7-things-i-require-in-the-future-mother-of-my-child">here</a>. Avoid criminogenic urban hives. Make sure that you approve of the local community before you move in somewhere. Don’t let them go to university. Make them learn something that will bring them a stable future.</p>
<p>Leave America if Trump does not make it great again. Find the fertile ground that will allow your children to grow well and safe. Pick a country that despises SJWs and outright mocks them.</p>
<h3>3. Be direct but constructive</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89825" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1-dad-talking-with-son.jpg" alt="1-dad-talking-with-son" width="400" height="273" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1-dad-talking-with-son.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1-dad-talking-with-son-262x179.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Tell them that life is unfair, that family is sacred and explain what death is, among other things. Explain clearly what are the concepts of hard work, merit, strength and beauty, that men and women are very different. That physical appearance and money are important, but that they are not the panacea.</p>
<p>No matter what they say, no man wants to hear that he is weak and no woman wants to hear that she is unattractive.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89833" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-1200x800.jpg" alt="Unwed-father" width="401" height="267" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-1200x800.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-768x512.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father-574x383.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Unwed-father.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px"></p>
<p>Tell them that a man has only his integrity and guts for him while a woman has only her fleeting beauty and sexual purity to rely on. Tell them when they have made a mistake and don’t tell them that they are the best if they are not.</p>
<p>While they should not laugh at people that are truly handicapped, when he asks “Dad, why is the lady so fat and smells funny?”, it is your sacred duty to answer: “Because she is lonely, has no self-control and is lazy, my son.”</p>
<h3>4. Be the media master</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89832" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/parental-controls-preview.jpg" alt="parental-controls-preview" width="400" height="267" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/parental-controls-preview.jpg 500w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/parental-controls-preview-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/parental-controls-preview-262x175.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Own a screening device but not the poisonous tube that goes with it. The tube is at war with what you are. Empowered tubs of lard and manginas are not welcome in the sanctuary that is your home.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>If you have to make your little ones watch something, have a look at it first. Check the DVD cover, the plot, the signs. Aim for pre-2000 and Internet. Decide.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89830" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Father-and-sons-reading-book-on-couch.jpe" alt="Father and sons reading book on couch" width="400" height="266" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Father-and-sons-reading-book-on-couch.jpe 615w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Father-and-sons-reading-book-on-couch-300x200.jpe 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Father-and-sons-reading-book-on-couch-262x174.jpe 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Father-and-sons-reading-book-on-couch-574x382.jpe 574w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Provide them with a huge library. Read for them. Encourage them to read on their own. Never stop buying books. Do not allow their devices to have Internet until their minds can understand what is on it. No smartphones. No exception.</p>
<p>Phones are fine. No social network for you, no social network for them. Explain that the real life is out there. There can be a computer with Internet. In the living room, accessible to them during the day and when you are there. Child-proof the Internet and install parental control on your own devices, such as tablets, that are lying around.</p>
<h3>5. Celebrate your culture without forcing it on them</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89835" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square-famille.jpg" alt="square-famille" width="400" height="429" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square-famille.jpg 666w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square-famille-300x322.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square-famille-262x281.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/square-famille-574x615.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Share it. If it is interesting, rich, exciting and beautiful, it will impress on its own and stick. It should be like a beautiful painting on the wall of one’s house. Always there, quietly hanging. It has been seen thousands of times but even away from it, every minor detail of it is memorized.</p>
<p>Bring them to museums instead of theme parks. Help them create a positive cultural identity for themselves.</p>
<p>Read them stories of the great heroes of old and ask them what they think of it. Share slices of life of your childhood and the moments shared with the ones that came before you.</p>
<h3>6. Keep them away from the bad seed</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89837" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1401329-mon-enfant-a-de-mauvaises-frequentations.jpg" alt="1401329-mon-enfant-a-de-mauvaises-frequentations" width="400" height="266" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1401329-mon-enfant-a-de-mauvaises-frequentations.jpg 540w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1401329-mon-enfant-a-de-mauvaises-frequentations-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1401329-mon-enfant-a-de-mauvaises-frequentations-262x174.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>The foe in your own backyard is as dangerous as the overlords that want your heirs to follow the herd. Neighbourhood kids, classmates. Keep an eye on the surroundings of your children. Birds of a feather flock together. Keep also an eye on teachers and neighboring adults.</p>
<p>The problem is that children are attracted by nature to what is forbidden. Do not yell and ban outright. Be subtle AT FIRST. Mock, belittle, display alpha traits, just like with game. Heartiste has an<a href="https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2015/12/22/advice-for-fathers-trying-to-keep-their-teen-daughters-off-the-pole/"> interesting point of view on that matter</a>. If the problem persists, use fear, the universal equalizer. Nuke peer pressure. Let someone else’s kid be a degenerate.</p>
<h3>7. Give them brothers and sisters</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89838" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family3.jpg" alt="family3" width="399" height="316" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family3.jpg 690w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family3-300x238.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family3-667x529.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family3-262x208.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/06/family3-574x455.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></p>
<p>A sibling is an ally. A second mind that can bring guidance as well as safety when the father is gone.</p>
<p>An extra root to a strong family tree and one more defender and carrier of your name. If unfortunately you messed up one, (no one is safe) you have a few others to save your line from vanishing into PC-approved degeneracy.</p>
<h3>En résumé</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-89839" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/06/4aa99a9db9d0f324df1c570de9741911.jpg" alt="4aa99a9db9d0f324df1c570de9741911" width="401" height="289"></p>
<p>Fathers of the previous generations could afford to be distant, god-like figures as family, religion and culture were on their side to look after their heirs. But today, the establishment is at war with us on all fronts. We cannot leave our children be and go with the flow while hoping for the best.</p>
<p>It will be hard and it will last for a while. But it is your duty to look after your own. Be strong and just. Keep going. Do not cave in. They are your children. They will not stop loving you for being strict. There is a reason why parents before us always said “You will thank me later.”</p>
