<p>If you listen to the hysterical mainstream media, you’ll walk away with the impression that<em> something just has to be done</em> about gun violence, rights of the peons be damned. Those rebel flag waving hicks and people who “cling to their guns and religion”—to quote Barack Hussein Obama—are going to have to bend the knee to the stripping of one of their most fundamental freedoms, the Second Amendment, so we can all live in a hypothetical, perfectly safe socialistic bubble, and more importantly, so people won’t have any defense against encroaching tyranny.</p>
<p>Sure, the American military has weapons beyond the wildest dreams of the simple gun owner, but the gun owners have strength in numbers. It’s hard to send people to government work camps when there are 357 million firearms in the nation—more guns than there are people. At the very least, all hell will break loose when government agents come around to round people up, if indeed that ever happened. It won’t be a neat and tidy transition to authoritarianism with a populace armed to the teeth.</p>
<p>Never is the fact mentioned by elites in the propagandist media that <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/21/you-have-a-0-0012-chance-of-dying-in-a-mass-shooting/">authoritarian governments from that of Mao Zedong to Hitler stripped their citizens of guns</a> before instituting totalitarian governments that murdered millions, nor is the fact you have a near zero chance of dying in a mass shooting ever given the emphasis it deserves. Hitler knew the importance of disarming the citizenry before subjecting them.</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="quote_font" style="font-size: small;">The most foolish mistake we could possibly make would be to allow the subjugated races to possess arms. History shows that all conquerors who have allowed their subjugated races to carry arms have prepared their own downfall by so doing. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that the supply of arms to the underdogs is a sine qua non for the overthrow of any sovereignty. So let’s not have any native militia or native police. </span></p></blockquote>

<p>Beyond the fact citizens are disarmed before they are subjected to centralized power, despite the genuflecting of countless empty headed talking heads, the fact is life is much more mundane than they would like it to be. You are far more likely to die when you go hop into your box on wheels sedan (<a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/24/break-the-bondage-of-car-payment-slavery/">that you are probably in debt bondage paying for</a>) and make your way down to your corporate job. In fact, twice the number of people die <em>every single day</em> in automobile accidents than died in the “biggest mass shooting in history” in Orlando. Yet, we haven’t heard from the left about banning automobiles. (Yet, anyway. <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/02/18/global-warming-or-global-government/">The global warming religion will push that agenda item at a later date</a>.)</p>
<p>Here are things that really kill people in great numbers, but they don’t make for compelling video to suit a news director’s need to create drama so he, she or zhe (heh) can put asses in seats in front of the idiot box. Asses that your local propaganda outlet needs so desperately. You are more likely to die from falling out of a tree than you are at the hands of a mass murderer. Let’s look at things that kill more people than mass shooters:</p>

<p>The mass media also never bring up the fact that an increasing chorus of people, from Judge Napolitano to Steven Seagal are questioning the truthfulness of sensational news headlines the echo chamber foams at the mouth selling to a public that is, by and large, malleable and suggestive to thought control. Here are some bombshells that the media selectively avoided when they were trotting out their gun control narratives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Judge Napolitano revealed that nobody died until 5:13 AM in the Orlando mass shooting—that is until the FBI and SWAT teams entered the Orlando gay club hours after the standoff began. This raises a number of questions that were never even brought up, let alone answered. Napolitano is apparently the only mainstream media personality who bothered to read the FBI’s report. He said: <em>Here’s whats news in the summary, nobody died until 5:13 in the morning, when the SWAT team entered, prior to that no one had been killed. The 53 that were injured, and the 49 that were murdered all met their fates at the time of, and during, the police entry into the building.</em> This is a bombshell revelation, readily available in the official FBI report.</li>
<li>Steven Seagal dropped this bomb on Russian television last fall: <i>I believe that, and I hate to say this, a lot of these mass murders and all this funny stuff that’s going on, I believe a lot of this is engineered.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond questioning the official narrative and conspiracy theories, even if you think people who question authority are nuts, the representation of of gun violence as increasing—as half the public thinks it is—reveals the power of the corporate press to distort facts and create false realities as Congress’ own statistics reveal. Gun crimes and gun violence have plummeted over the past 20 years, yet the public believes otherwise. As Einstein said: <em><span class="st">Blind belief in authority is the greatest enemy of truth</span></em><span class="st">.</span></p>

</div>
<h3>Gun Violence At Record Lows</h3>
<p>Let’s look at some statistics. The number of guns per person has increased from 0.93 to 1.45 over the last 20 years. There are more guns than people in the United States. That is a whopping 56% increase in the number of guns over a generation. However, the gun homicide rate has tumbled 49% in that same time. The gun homicide rate has fallen from 7.0 to 3.6 deaths per 100,000 people.<strong> Gun homicides have been cut in half while the number of guns has more than doubled!</strong> This is exceptional news, but chances are you have never heard of it unless you read alternative media. This fact gun crime is down is coming straight from the horse’s mouth, the U.S. Government itself.</p>
<p>Despite the fact you are more likely to die of just about anything but guns in your lifetime, the fact gun violence is plummeting to record lows, and the fact people own more guns than ever proving there is no link between gun ownership and violence, politicians feel the need to take away the average citizen’s capability to defend against criminals and tyranny. This reveals the gun violence narrative is pushed by politicians and the media for a reasons other than those stated by our “social betters.”</p>

</div>
<ul>
<li>Politicians and social engineers need to create a gun violence issue to continue <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/75335/what-is-the-hegelian-dialectic">the Hegelian dialectic</a>: spin up a “gun control” problem, have a preplanned solution (i.e. gun confiscation) in place, and direct all “solutions” towards that goal.</li>
<li>The media makes their living and maintains their ivory tower by creating problems to create profit. There is nothing scarier to average people than the prospect of being mowed down by a nut with a gun, so the rational and responsible view that yes, mass shootings are an issue but do not deserve 24/7 attention is immediately discarded in favor of sensationalism. This also speaks to the lack of journalistic integrity to report on mass shootings but also to calm the public down with the fact that these are very isolated events and that gun violence overall is tumbling. They often excuse their hysteria with “human interest” in these bloody stories, pointing to the victims. This is nothing but exploitation of tragedy for profit and to push an agenda, as far more people die from other causes of death each and every day.</li>
<li>Creating “sitting ducks” by pushing gun-free zones all over the nation is another way guns and gun owners are marginalized. The government doesn’t need to ban the Second Amendment if they make the entire country a gun-free zone. Gun-free zones invite violence, as attackers know they’re more likely to inflict harm on defenseless sheep than armed wolves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond gun violence and gun homicides being at historical lows, there are other facts the puppet masters don’t want you to know.</p>

<h3>More Hidden Information</h3>
<p>Let’s bust a couple more gun myths promulgated by the irresponsible and shameless mass media and look at a couple of important facts they ignore.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: Children are at significant risk at school of being killed by a mass shooter. </strong></p>
<p>After Sandy Hook, an impressionable and irrational public immediately pushed for schools to be gun-free zones, and to turn schools into the equivalent of prisons for children. However, only a couple of generations ago the above scene at a Delaware high school played out after a threat was called into the high school. Students and teachers went to their cars to pull out their guns at the school, and no gunman ever showed up. My, how times have changed.</p>
<p>Additionally, more children die each year on bicycles, from space heater fires, and in drownings than from guns. But, we don’t hear calls for banning bicycles, heaters, and swimming pools because that doesn’t make for good TV or good politics. Also, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/06/the-ugly-truth-about-abortion-from-a-doctor-who-performed-them/">liberal mothers kill more unborn children than guns each and every year through abortion</a>, yet women go into a hissy fit if anyone talks about taking away their right to murder a defenseless, voiceless human being.</p>
<p><strong>Myth: Crime is lower in countries that have banned guns. </strong></p>
<p>One need look no further than our neighbor Mexico, where guns are forbidden for the average citizen but every cartel and criminal has them. Many Mexican cities look like war zones and I personally witnessed two shootouts between the Mexican military and cartel members when I lived there. One has to think the gangs would not be as brazen if the average citizen had the capability to defend themselves. So, Mexico is an example of gun control nightmare. The CATO institute also dropped this truth bomb on gun grabbers.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Israel and Switzerland, for example, a license to possess guns is available on demand to every law-abiding adult, and guns are easily obtainable in both nations. Both countries also allow widespread carrying of concealed firearms, and yet, admits Dr. Arthur Kellerman, one of the foremost medical advocates of gun control, Switzerland and Israel “have rates of homicide that are low despite rates of home firearm ownership that are at least as high as those in the United States.” A comparison of crime rates within Europe reveals no correlation between access to guns and crime.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gun control disarms good people, as criminals will always find a way around laws.</p>
<p><strong>Fact: SSRIs are strongly correlated with mass shootings.</strong></p>
<p>Eric Harris at Columbine, Seung Hui-Cho at Virginia Tech, James Holmes at Aurora, Christopher Harper Mercer in South Carolina, Andreas Lubitz, the Germanwings pilot who killed 149 people, and Adam Lanza of Sandy Hook all were on high doses of SSRI anti-depressants. As Dr. Peter Breggin has warned, going to a psychiatrist has become one of the most dangerous things a person can do. Breggin also wrote this in his book Your Drug May Be Your Problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Advocates of psychiatric drugs often claim that the medications improve learning and the ability to benefit from psychotherapy, but the contrary is true.  There are no drugs that improve mental function, self-understanding, or human relations.  Any drug that affects mental processes does so by impairing them.</p></blockquote>
<p>And more tellingly:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite a hugely successful promotional campaign by drug companies and biological psychiatry, the effectiveness of most or all psychiatric drugs remains difficult to demonstrate.  The drugs often prove no more effective than sugar pills, or placebos – and to accomplish even these limited positive results, the clinical trials and data that they generate typically have to be statistically manipulated.</p></blockquote>
<p>The effects of these drugs are chilling, and a large number of people become agitated and manic when they take them.</p>
<blockquote><p>The newer antidepressants including Prozac, Zoloft, Paxil, Luvox, Celexa, and Lexapro commonly cause some degree of over-stimulation. The effects are not unlike those of cocaine and amphetamine, and both the Prozac-like drugs and the stimulants impair function of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine. Some of the other newer antidepressants, including Effexor, Serzone, Cymbalta and Wellbutrin can have similar effects. No one knows the frequency of very severe reactions to the antidepressants. Some studies indicate that some degree of clinically significant over-stimulation and mania is caused in a startling 5%-10% of all patients taking these drugs. A number of clinical reports have also described a syndrome of obsessive SSRI-induced suicidality and violence that seems particular to these drugs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than calling for an investigation into pill-pushing prostitutes with medical degrees, as some doctors are, the media pushes a gun control agenda as the “magic bullet” that will fix everything. The correlation between SSRIs and mass shootings is never given proper attention because pharmaceutical advertising is a $5.17 billion dollar industry, and the media needs this revenue to prop up their sagging bottom lines.</p>
<p><strong>Fact: Cops kill more people than mass shooters. </strong></p>
<p>The very people who are supposed to protect the public kill far more people than mass shooters. Statistically, you are 9 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than a mass shooter. Are the cops acting in self defense most of the time? Probably. But there are also videos coming out by the truckload that show police are often acting inappropriately and an in abusive manner to the public they are supposed to protect and serve.</p>
<p>Last year alone cops killed 1,205 people. Were all those deaths justified? Most of them probably were. But how many people were killed that should not have been? Nobody is watching the watchers except for the web site <a href="http://killedbypolice.net/">Killed By Police</a>, so nobody knows. Yet, the media never focus on this as they always push the public towards complete and total trust in authority, whether it be government bureaucrats or militarized police.</p>
<p>So, each of the gun grabbers’ arguments can be destroyed through some basic research and logic. The argument that people don’t need guns because there are police is the equivalent of saying people don’t need fire extinguishers because there are fire departments. By the time the police arrive in their average 10 minute response time, the criminal is already going to be gone. And your house is already likely to be burned down from a small kitchen fire that could have easily been extinguished.</p>
<p>Once again we defenders of freedom are making the colossal mistake of letting the Marxist left and media control the narrative, then playing defense against their narrative. Gentlemen, the time has come to push back against the left. We have to find some way to put them on the defense about their insane policies and beliefs. Every time they bring out a new agenda item, they push and push until we fall back. Sooner or later the line must the drawn, and the authoritarians shown we will not be pushed any farther. Making them defend their insane positions instead of libertarians and traditionalists defending their positions, as we are doing now, is the most important move we can make.</p>
