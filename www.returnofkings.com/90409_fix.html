<p>With technology making it both easier to connect with people around the world—and making it more difficult to interact with people on the streets—online dating has become a important part of every man’s repertoire. But how do you make online dating work for you? Given that women can easily use online dating as a means to get attention–or hide unpleasant things about themselves, such as obesity or social justice—how can you avoid time-wasters, freaks and psychos?</p>

<p>Whether you’re in cyberspace or meatspace, meeting girls is a numbers game, but there are a number of ways you can narrow down the field and find a girl who’s right for you. Here’s how…</p>
<h3>1. Filter out girls who are politically incompatible with you</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-83342" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/feminist-300x187.png" alt="feminist" width="465" height="290" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/03/feminist-300x187.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/feminist-262x163.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/03/feminist.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px"></p>
<p>Politics go far beyond your actual opinions and voting habits: they’re a reflection of how you view the world and how you behave. If you’re looking for a feminine, wifely woman, you’re not going to find her at a Bernie Sanders rally, crowing about muh free college tuition and whining about the “racism” of the right. Leftist women are more likely to be slutty, masculinized, mentally ill and have a host of other negative traits that make them unsuitable for love or marriage.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rooshv.com/why-you-should-not-have-sex-with-girls-who-hate-donald-trump">As Roosh has stated already</a>, the best women to date and marry are those who don’t hate Donald Trump. A woman who is open to conservative ideas is also one who will be more likely to grow her hair out and want to be a wife and mother. Life is too short to waste on tussling with unstable social network broads who go ballistic upon seeing you wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat in your profile.</p>
<p>While it’s theoretically possible to convert a leftie girl into a conservative one, it’s also theoretically possible to win the lottery and get struck by lightning. By concentrating on female demographics who already have the qualities you want, you make it easier to find the kind of woman you can spend the rest of your life with.</p>
<h3>2. Focus on foreign girls</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-56180" src="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/russian-woman-300x204.jpg" alt="russian-woman" width="432" height="294" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2015/02/russian-woman-300x204.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/russian-woman-262x178.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/russian-woman-574x391.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2015/02/russian-woman.jpg 604w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"></p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div>

<p>Out of the crooked timber of Western culture, no straight girl will ever be made. Women in the West are marinaded in a toxic soup of social media, male thirst, sexual perversion and institutionalized misandry. Any girl raised in this environment is going to be varying degrees of dysfunctional, even if she’s purportedly a “good girl” or has an intact family. There is no escaping the cultural Marxist leviathan.</p>
<p>The best way to guarantee that your blushing bride-to-be won’t pull an <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> on you is to find one from a land that hasn’t been corrupted. Healthy plants can’t grow from poisoned soil, and the soil in eastern Europe and other lands untouched by Western cultural Marxism is still fertile. While there are no guarantees in life, wooing a woman from these lands gives you a better chance of success than the corrupt environment of the West.</p>
<p>The more time you spend abroad experiencing other cultures—whether you’re in Europe, Asia or South America—the more you’ll realize that Western culture is deeply sick and antithetical to forming healthy relationships. Meeting a woman from a culture that reveres family, patriarchy, and tradition will increase the likelihood that the two of you will have a happily ever after.</p>
<h3>3. Don’t get too attached to girls right away</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-85847" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/girls.russia.dating-300x200.jpg" alt="girls.russia.dating" width="420" height="280" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/04/girls.russia.dating-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/girls.russia.dating-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/girls.russia.dating-574x383.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/04/girls.russia.dating.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px"></p>
<p>At its heart, online dating is speed dating for the slow and shy. Getting attached to a girl you haven’t met yet—or have barely spent any time with—is a recipe for disaster. The likelihood of meeting your dream woman on the first go is unlikely at best, and by becoming too smitten with one girl—nice as she may be—you’re ruining your chances of actually finding a girl you’re compatible with.</p>
<p>When meeting girls via the Internet, message as many as you can and don’t get serious about any single one until you’ve had time to see them in person and get to know them a bit. Remember that online dating is ultimately a numbers game—much like meeting women in general—and you can’t afford to put any girl on a pedestal at any stage of the relationship.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, online dating is like any other form of dating in that you get out of it what you put in. If you approach it in a lackadaisical fashion, you’ll get lackluster results. By learning how to screen girls and focusing on girls from intact cultures, you’ll decrease the number of bad dates you get stuck on and increase your likelihood of success. There are plenty of feminine girls out there looking for a masculine man, and by adjusting your methods, you’ll make it easier to find them.</p>
