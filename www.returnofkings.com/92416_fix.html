<p>The U.S. mainstream media is hailing the record number of female athletes which are <a href="http://www.worldtinderwomen.com/category/global-region/south-america/brazil/" target="_blank">heading to Rio de Janeiro</a> for the Olympic Games, with a <a href="http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/07/25/u-s-team-to-field-a-record-number-of-female-athletes-at-rio-olympics/" target="_blank">total of 292</a> out of the 555 American competitors being women. Because you know, gender gaps are worthy of congratulations and applause just as long as there are less men and more women stepping up to the plate.</p>
<p>In truth, this is actually a sad state of affairs. It means that the U.S. Olympic team will have less than a 50% chance of seeing a <strong>real champion</strong>, rather than a 2nd rate gold medalist from the weaker sex, achieving athletic glory on the world stage.</p>
<p>I’ve said it before in my previous article “<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/33987/anything-women-can-do-men-can-do-better" target="_blank">Anything Women Can Do, Men Can Do Better</a>,” and I’ll say it again in 2016. The best females can never outclass the best males in sport and athleticism.</p>
<h3>Denial Is A River In Lefty Land</h3>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/p5wwhYz6dNQ%3Frel=0.html" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Feminists always love to espouse that women can be “just as good as any man” in sports, but this has always been a preposterous falsehood. The average women only has <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477683" target="_blank">roughly 60%</a> of the strength and muscle characteristics of a comparable man, and the greatest gender difference in upper body strength can probably be attributed to the fact that women tend to have a significantly lower proportion of their lean muscle tissue distributed in the upper body.</p>
<p>In other words, women will NEVER reach the stratospheric heights of the best male boxers, weightlifters, javelin throwers, hammer throwers, rowers, swimmers, pole vaulters, and a host of other Olympic events where upper body strength is pivotal to reaching the podium.</p>
<p>But what about feats of agility and stamina where upper body strength is not quite as vital? Such as Association Football (Soccer) and most running and jumping events at track and field? Well grab your adult coloring books and head to your “safe space” SJW’s, because the best male runners at the marathon (the biggest combo test of speed and stamina) are routinely faster than the best women.</p>
<blockquote><p>“At every distance up to the marathon, the gap between men’s and women’s world record times is nine to 10 percent—and it’s a similar or even higher percentage among recreational runners.” – <a href="http://www.ohio-forum.com/2015/03/running-why-are-men-faster-than-women/" target="_blank">Runner’s World</a>, April 2015 Edition</p></blockquote>
<p>Get it? Due to irrefutable biological characteristics, women just don’t have the strength, speed, and physical fortitude to run faster or perform better at the same sport than the best men. Case in point, the Australian national women’s soccer team (which is participating at this Olympic games) was absolutely humiliated earlier this year by a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3609949/Matildas-lose-7-0-Newcastle-Jets-15s-Rio-Olympics-warm-up.html" target="_blank">7 – 0 loss</a> to the Australian national under FIFTEEN’s boys side (which is not participating).</p>
<p>Even in Olympic events which do not require overt displays of speed, stamina, or brute strength—such as gymnastics—denial dwelling SJWs and white knights may resort to saying that female gymnasts are more “graceful” and agile than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>Oh really? I beg to differ. Just watch British freerunner Will Sutton take a stroll around the Isle of Man, combining incredible acrobatics, athleticism, speed, stamina, and landing dangerous jumps that not a single woman has been able to emulate thus far.</p>

<h3>Authoritative Quotes On Male And Female Physiology</h3>
<blockquote><p>‘Agility depends upon the ability to decelerate and accelerate fast, and men – because of their larger muscles – will always have an advantage,’ – Harry Brennan, Exercise Physiologist</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p id="ext-gen20">‘There was a period in the Seventies when women equaled or broke more world records than men, but that was before the fall of the Berlin Wall.’  – Harry Brennan, Exercise Physiologist</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>(Translation: this was the era when Eastern Bloc coaches were feeding female athletes steroids like sweets. They were outright <strong>cheaters</strong>.)</em></p>
<blockquote><p>‘The male skeleton is bigger and gives them an inherent advantage – larger bones are generally stronger,’ – Ignac Fogelman, Endocrinologist Professor</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>‘Faster men’s times for 100 to 800 meters are mostly due to men, on average, having greater muscle mass—and a larger portion of it is fast-twitch, which allows them to generate greater force, speed, and anaerobically produced energy’ – Chris Schwirian, Biological Sciences lecturer at Ohio University</p></blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Whenever female athletes are awarded a “gold medal” at the Olympics, it should just be a giant knockoff of that cheap Hanukkah gelt (chocolate gold coins) that <a href="http://www.worldtinderwomen.com/tinder-women-tel-aviv-israel-bikini-attire/" target="_blank">Jewish</a> children get for the holiday season. After the brief surge of excitement that they have won “gold” (and attention whore themselves with it on Instagram), they can peel off the tin foil and feast on the chocolatey goodness inside until it’s all gone. “You go girl!” 😀</p>

</div>
<p>After all, since women are ultimately just big children, they merely deserve to have big children’s candy. The REAL gold medals should be allocated to the real champions of a sporting discipline’s top tier, which will always be men.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, “equality” obsessed feminists and SJW’s will be absolutely thrilled when women take home gold medals at the Olympic games, even though their competitive talents and event completion times will be noticeably worse than many male athletes who will return home with nothing.</p>
<p>So best of luck to all the male athletes in the Games of the XXXI Olympiad! Go for gold! (And I do mean the real kind).</p>
