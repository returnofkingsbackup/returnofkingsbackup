<p>Might Is Right attempts to make the social Darwinist argument that the human natural order only rewards strength and power, just like in the animal kingdom, and those who do not understand this fact will always get trampled on by groups who are more powerful.</p>
<p>Written in 1890 by anonymous writer Ragnar Redbeard, it includes a scathing attack on Christianity for fostering weakness in European-derived people. In spite of the questionable morality of its Darwinist position, the book’s predictions about how the West will be weakened has been quite accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The natural world is a world of war; the natural man is a warrior; the natural law is tooth and claw. All else is error.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>The victor gets the gold and the land every time. He, also, gets the fairest maidens, the glory tributes. And – why should it be otherwise? Why should the delights of life go to failures and cowards? Why should the spoils of battle belong to the unwarlike? That would be insanity, utterly unnatural and immoral.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redbeard argues that only a society built upon the principles of strength can avoid the crippling social problems that our generation is currently fighting against. The promotion of egalitarian ideas, which the author states originated with Christ, have elevated the weak and degenerate as beacons of what is right and true.</p>
<blockquote><p>What is your “civilization and progress” if its only outcome is hysteria and down going? What is “government and law” if their ripened harvests are men without sap? What are “religions and literatures” if their grandest productions are hordes of faithful slaves? What is “evolution and culture” if their noxious blossoms are sterilized women? What is “education and enlightenment” if their deadsea fruit is a caitiff race, with rottenness in its bones?</p></blockquote>
<p>When strength is not seen as a virtue, mean become weak and lost, mere slaves to the system that now has them solidly controlled.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everything that a corrupt civilization can do, is done to compress the growing intellect into unnatural channels. Thus the great mass of men who inhabit the world of to-day have no initiative, no originality or independence of thought, but are mere subjective individualities, who have never had the slightest voice in fashioning the ideals that they formally revere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Redbeard anticipates that a strongman type of leader will reassert the natural order. From him will come untold destruction as the system is overturned. Perhaps the man that Redbeard envisioned was Hitler, who did rise to power forty years after the book was written.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mankind is aweary, aweary of its sham prophets, its demagogues and its statesmen. It crieth out for kings and heroes. It demands a nobility – a nobility that cannot be hired with money, like slaves or beasts of burden. The world awaits the coming of mighty men of valor, great destroyers; destroyers of all that is vile, angels of death.</p></blockquote>
<p>Absolute truth that stems from nature must be identified and obeyed. Everything else can be discarded. Otherwise, egalitarian lies will ingrain itself into a people and destroy them to the point of extinction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever alleged “truth” is proven by results, to be but an empty fiction, let it be unceremoniously flung into the outer darkness among the dead gods, dead empires, dead philosophies and other useless lumber and wreckage.</p>
<p>…when a lie has gone too far—when it has taken up its abode in the very tissues, bones and brains of a people, then all remedies are useless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A man who doesn’t believe in using violence to achieve powerful ends is a slave to those who do, for violence is the only way to overthrow a tyrant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strong men are not deterred from pursuing their aim by anything. They go straight to the goal, and that goal is Beauty, Wealth and Material Power. The mission of Power is to control and exploit the powerless, for to be powerless is to be criminal.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>He who is afraid to risk his life must never be permitted to win anything.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>During the whole course of human history, there is not upon record, one authentic instance wherein a subjugated people has ever regained property-holding Liberty, without first butchering its tyrants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The author’s attack on Christianity is one of the harshest I’ve seen. He argues not whether Christ exists or not, but that he’s weak, incompetent, and has led European people astray for centuries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold the crucifix, what does it symbolize? Pallid incompetence hanging on a tree.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>‘Love your enemies and do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you’ is the despicable philosophy of the spaniel that rolls upon its back when kicked.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>If we lived as Christ lived, there would be none of us left to live. He begat no children; he labored not for his bread; he possessed neither house nor home; he merely talked. Consequently he must have existed on charity or have stolen bread.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve long argued that practicing game is a way for man to reach his potential, since it forces you to improve many other areas of your life. Redbeard states that war is the true mechanism that <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/86397/swedens-hopeless-impotence-shows-that-nations-need-hardship-to-remain-strong">fosters the best of men and nations</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>If men lived ‘like brothers’ and had no powerful enemies (neighbors) to contend with and surpass, they would rapidly lose all their best qualities; like certain oceanic birds that lose the use of their wings, because they do not have to fly from pursuing beasts of prey. If all men had treated each other with brotherly love since the beginning, what would have been the result now? If there had been no wars, no rivalry, no competition, no kingship, no slavery, no survival of the Toughest, no racial extermination, truly what a festering ‘hell fenced in’ this oldglobe would be?</p></blockquote>
<p>The author interprets equality as a poisoned idea that has been allowed to spread by inferior individuals who should have been destroyed by the strong, and that the struggle for existence will soon commence anew, more vicious than before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither the machinery nor the raw material of equality has ever existed, only the dream, the idea of it. Equality! Equality! In that one word is summed up the accumulated dementia of two thousand years! The thought of it was born in the brain of an inferior organism, and the brains of inferior organisms nourish it still.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>…the easiest way to enslave a Race is to wheedle it into or impose upon it counterfeit Ethics, that is to say, fraudulent standards of morality.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Foolish and blind (or mad) are they who think the struggle for existence ended. It is only begun. This Planet is in its infancy, not in its decrepitude. The “end of all things” is afar off. The kingdom of heaven is not at hand. Incessant is the rivalry for supremacy among men, and manifold are its metamorphoses. Not for a single hour, for a single second, is there an armistice. Night and day the combat rages.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Redbeard correctly predicted the sterility that would result if our countries were taken over by “social justice” and other ivory tower propagandists.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overt action is not always needful for the drastic removal of lower organisms. Very often, if left alone, degenerates cremate themselves. If given control of governmental mechanisms, they immediately commence to grind one another into mincemeat (that is to say, into dividends) – crying Holy! Holy! Holy! Mentally, physically, morally, they are past redemption. Doomed souls are they, miserable sinners!</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>As the Old Man of the Mountains trained his fanatical Assassins and sent them forth to slay, so Civilization trains its Fiendling Intellectuals and sends them forth to assassinate Human Nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You won’t win if you follow prescribed rules of law or morality. Redbeard advises you to break the rules in order to accomplish your goals. Violence, thieving, and immorality can be seen as justified and even celebrated if does on a large enough scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Great animals (whether man or brute) never operate in strict accordance with prearranged rules of procedure. If they did do so, they could never prosper and would die of hunger. Their greatness lies in springing surprises, in doing exactly what their antagonists (or intended quarry) doesn’t expect them to do, in being beyond and above all moral measurements whatsoever.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Slay one man (in order to rob him) and you are a murderer. Slay a million men (in order to rob them) and you are a renowned general. Annex from one person and you are a felonious ruffian, but annex from the whole population or from rival nations, and you are made Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chairman of Ways and Means, or decorated with the grand cross of the Legion of Honor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Women want a virile, strong man, not a vegetarian weakling.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strength, energy-of-character, ferocity, and courage, she admires in her possible husband, above all other qualities combined. Even to be carried-off by force, is not repugnant to her feelings, if the ‘bold bad man’ is in other respects acceptable. She pines to be ‘wooed and won,’ (or as it were) she likes to feel that she has been mastered, conquered, taken possession of—that the man who has stormed her heart is in all respects, a man among men.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Wherever soldiers conquer in war, they also conquer in love—after the first paroxysm of revengeful patriotism is over. Women of vanquished races are usually very prone to wed with the men who have slaughtered their kindred in battle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redbeard states that feminists are absolutely useless because they cannot provide strong men with sons.</p>
<blockquote><p>There is nothing particularly inviting about baren, dyspeptic, bluestocking, ‘New Women,’ in pants and spectacles; talking idiotic snuffle through their noses; with busts made of adjustable india-rubber; with narrow or padded hips, and ‘wheels between their legs,’ scorching across the curbstones like mad. When such women are ‘captured’ what good are they? They won’t even breed; or if they do so (by accident) their puny embryos, have to be delicately nurtured into life with steam-heated incubator – mechanism and afterwards fed and weaned on ‘the bottle.’ The sons of such women – bottle fed abortions – of what good are they?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you happen to be weak and a man who is strong wants to kill you, here’s the advice the author has for you: “Woe unto those who stumble! Woe unto Ye who fall!” At this point one has to wonder if Redbeard is actually serious that you deserve to die if you happen to slip once in the presence of a man stronger than you, who should not be bound by any type of ethical code in order to slay you on the spot if he is able to do so.</p>
<p>Imagine a man on the street bends over to tie his shoes. Another man, seeing that he is in a vulnerable position, slits his throat with a knife and steals his money. Redbeard’s philosophy could find justification for this behavior, simply because the killer was “strong” at the critical moment while the victim made himself “weak.” For that reason, it is almost impossible to defend his ideas on an individual level, though it may have more application when pitting one society against another. While I doubt that many of you want to be the type of man who kills others in the name of strength alone, at the very least you must be able to defend against other men by maximizing your own strength.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Might-Right-Ragnar-Redbeard/dp/1300653892/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1458562776&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=might+right&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=rooshlog-20&amp;linkId=b37cf60328c682da46970797220a6259&amp;linkId=VEDJEMU3ZK35YLDL">Might Is Right</a> ultimately makes an anti-religious and anti-tradition argument for human organization, providing justification for the extermination of societies or peoples based solely on strength. Whatever allows you to gain ultimate power over the lives of others is the correct answer regardless of its morality or effect on the social aspects of society.</p>
<p>How would the author interpret ISIS, who is implementing his model of strength to take over lands, killing and executing along the way? I don’t suspect that the author wants Western society to look like present-day Iraq, but he definitely had in mind the fact that Islamic forces have been using strength to wage jihad on European lands. In that respect, Might Is Right can be seen as a self-defense manual for European people against Islam. After noting the many anti-black and anti-Jewish outbursts within the book, my best guess is that Redbeard envisions a homogeneous Europe that retains Viking-like strength against its enemies. A hint of that is the pseudonym he chose.</p>
<p>I’m in full agreement with Redbeard that if you are weaker than those who wish to take your land, you will lose, and no Christian idea or egalitarian slogan will save you when men who are ready to kill for their beliefs arrive on your doorstep while you hold a “Refugees Welcome” sign. Teaching societal passivity and meekness while other violent groups exist among you is suicidal and will result in slaughter.</p>
<p>In the end, might will eventually subjugate the weak, even if the weak is intelligent, moral, or do-gooding. It may take centuries for that to happen, but it will, and unless you can properly fight against groups who are strong, who truly believe that might makes right, you will be eradicated. Even if you don’t believe, morally, that might makes right, there is always a human group that does, and unless you can stop them, they will kill you and rape your most beautiful women. Therefore if you are ready to conclude that strength is what’s essential for victory, it wouldn’t hurt to develop that strength yourself.</p>
