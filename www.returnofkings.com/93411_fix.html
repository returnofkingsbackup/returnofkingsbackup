<p>My original plan was to do an article on the criminality of the Clinton family stretching back to the 1980s, but I’ll do that next week. I feel like I earned a mansophere badge of honor the past few days as I witnessed a full-fledged Social Justice Warrior swarming descend onto my blog and Twitter page <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/15/take-this-job-and-shove-it/">over a simple comic entitled Take This Job and Shove It</a>, depicting an American guy getting frustrated with HR tyranny at his dead-end job and taking a trip to one of the most beautiful parts of the world only to find love and share an innocent kiss. That simple narrative was enough to make certain corners of the internet descend to DEFCON 3. It was one of the most swift and stunning displays of feminist intolerance I’ve ever seen.</p>
<h3>The Thought Crime Incident</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-93804" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book.png" alt="Comic_Book" width="919" height="3138" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book.png 919w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book-300x1024.png 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book-768x2622.png 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book-837x2858.png 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book-667x2278.png 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book-262x895.png 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Comic_Book-574x1960.png 574w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px"></p>
<p>I would like to begin by thanking some guy named Josh Fruhlinger (Alexa rank 156,992—heh) for driving a spike in traffic my way with his very literate critical analysis of my comics series. It is a personal badge of honor to have this manlet call my series the “worst comic ever” in true Simpsons Comic Book Guy fashion. This was his exact Tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>oh god i found the worst cartoon ever, literally, in the world.</p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_93626" style="width: 359px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-93626" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/JFruh.jpg" alt="Josh and his cat" width="349" height="371" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/JFruh.jpg 282w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/JFruh-262x279.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Josh and his cat</p>
</div>
<p>Before I could click onto his Twitter page and use some of the ensuing comments and SJW hate fest to further promote my comic book by showing people exactly what miserable “comic curmudgeons” Josh’s followers are by airing out their vitriolic comments, he preemptively blocked me from accessing his page. Josh, my Twitter page is still open to you because I’m not nearly as thin-skinned as you are. Bring on the fire and brimstone.</p>
<p>Josh and the gaggle of people who follow this Twitter page seem to me like the type of douchey Left Coast liberals that made me flee America in the first place. Apparently, comic aficionados (who also have a thing for cats) aren’t keen on comics that challenge established Hivemind, Culturally Marxist narratives and were designed only to piss people like him off.</p>
<p>Apparently, I succeeded on that front considering the rage that ensued. So, mission accomplished. The incident drove thousands of rabid SJWs my way, all of them vivisecting my comics and hurling spittle-addled insults my way. Thanks for the traffic, assholes. Perhaps even more enjoyably, some comments actually defended my series pointing out Josh and his ilk hate it only because they doesn’t agree with its politics.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, we in the manosphere are the new counterculture. This incident confirms that.</p>
<h3>The Swarming</h3>

</div>
<p>Only hours after Josh shared the comic, it happened. A full-blown Social Justice Warrior swarming. They were seething with white hot rage. On a Friday night no less, a bunch of losers with nothing better to do started in right around sunset and continued masturbating each others’ egos all weekend long, taking some of the cheapest shots imaginable to mankind. Over a fucking comic, no less!</p>
<p>It was simply a sight to behold for about 30 minutes until I saw they weren’t going to stop and had no lives. After responding to a few of the initial (and very racist) Tweets, I ducked out and went down to the beach to talk with a few ladies and ended up getting high and banging two of them in probably the best menage a trois I’ve ever had. When I came back the next morning, the losers were still posting hate on Twitter.</p>

<p>It was their typical, boilerplate, character assassinating, self-flagellating playbook. I was a virgin. I was a loser. Then someone made the baseless claim that I sexually harassed someone. Worse, Social Justice Warriors apparently think all Asian women come from Thailand, as the comic that sparked the outrage is set in Phnom Penh, and Angkor Wat (clearly depicted) is in Cambodia. But they relentlessly attacked Thai women.</p>
<p>Their stereotyping of all Asian women as coming from Thailand only proves how incredibly myopic and ignorant SJWs are. Then there was the racism, to use their collective favorite term. Many of them then went on to imply the only reason an attractive, feminine Asian girl would want an American guy is “to escape her third world cesspool” implying all Asians are destitute and all Asian women are nothing but green card seekers.</p>
<blockquote><p>what happens when the lady degrading herself to escape a third world existence finds out Dirk is broke?</p></blockquote>
<p>This was my reply before I got bored and left to enjoy my Friday night:</p>
<blockquote><p>You people have some serious issues. An Asian girl acts sweet in a comic and you people have a meltdown? Holy shit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, another Twitterer brought up going to Mexico and having organs harvested, in such a way that implies all Mexicans harvest organs. In essence, SJWs become everything they claim to hate when conducting a swarming. These people hold themselves up as warriors against injustice then go on to lump not one but two races into stereotypical groups while simultaneously denigrating both groups! So, apparently Josh Fruhlinger (isn’t that name German?) has some Nazi Twitter followers who do not like Asians (particularly Asian women) and Mexicans, based on the hate posted to my Twitter account after he threw up the link. Other comics they roundly hated, much to my delight were <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/04/be-like-dirk-episode-5/">Be Like Dirk, Episode 5,</a> <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/06/08/beat-it-loser/">Beat It, Loser</a> and <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/2016/05/25/the-vortex-of-hell/">The Vortex of Hell</a>.</p>

<p>The vitriol continues this week, as a tatted up columnist named Robyn something or other on Wonkette continues bashing the comic. Feminists are apparently terrified of women from traditional cultures and an innocent kiss shared between a man trying to escape the toxic culture they’ve created, and a traditional woman. Her tone in the article is one of<em> if you men want to go get those dirty foreign bitches, then go them! </em>It’s very offensive, to use one of the leftists’ favorite terms. The Wonkette columnist was also incensed over my illustration of Big Daddy Government and women figuratively marrying him instead of a Beta male in the comic Infinite Resources.</p>
<h3>What to do in a swarming</h3>
<p>So, What have I learned from this? As Vox Day points out, if you are ever the target of a SJW swarming, realize nobody gives a damn about what they’re saying except them. In a very useful useful article he created about how to defend yourself against a SJW swarming, the best advice is to rely on the three R’s.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rely on the Three Rs: RECOGNIZE it is happening. REMAIN calm. REALIZE no one cares.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just let it go, and let themselves work themselves into a frenzy over the<em> violation of narrative</em> thought crime.</p>
<p>Turnabout is fair play, and even though Fruhlinger blocked me I was still able find some real gems among his great works of art and offer up my own criticism. Listening to his effeminate voice read his own book is enough to put me in stitches laughing. If this doesn’t make you want to buy his novel, nothing will. Josh says: “<i>The Enthusiast</i> is my first novel. It’s about trains, comics, stealth marketing, capitalism, and joy.”</p>
<p>Look for this novel to go right to the top of the <em>New York Times</em> Bestseller list. It’s a sure thing. Apparently, it took him four years to write and a chapter from the book has yielded three “hearts” on Medium. You can purchase it from such well-known vendors as TopatoCo. Additionally, if you are interested in reading more dreck, Josh’s reviews on The Comics Curmudgeon are typical of snarky, nihilistic, navel-watching weak Beta male genetic dead ends that have infested and are killing the United States. In other words, nothing new from the typical, culturally suicidal cesspool found in the lamestream media in America.</p>
<p>By the way, if you want to buy the Politically Incorrect Comic Book that generated bellyaches, explosive shits, and foaming at the mouth among Social Justice Warriors, <a href="https://relampagofurioso.com/be-like-dirk-comic-book/">I’ve cut the price on it by 40% in honor of the occasion</a>. I so enjoyed seeing these losers get mad I may even have to work this incident into Season Two of the series. It’s really a good time pushing liberal fascist buttons. Publish a comic about a man taking an innocent trip then finding love overseas, and watch them turn into rabid, racist hate mongers. Who ever knew it was so easy to trigger them?</p>
