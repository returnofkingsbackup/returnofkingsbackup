<p>Late on Saturday afternoon police in Milwaukee, Wisconsin shot an armed suspect fleeing from a car on the city’s North Side. Not long after the shooting a large group of residents initiated a confrontation with police that included at least one squad car being burned. A gas station and other autos were also torched.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cbs58.com/story/32753475/milwaukee-pd-shoot-and-kill-fleeing-suspect-on-citys-northside">officer-involved shooting</a> occurred at around 3:30 PM and involved two MPD officers who had stopped a car near the 3200 block of N. 44th Street. The two suspects inside fled on foot with the officers giving chase. In short order one of the suspects pointed a semi-automatic pistol at the officers and was killed, according to CBS.</p>
<p>In the hours after the shooting groups of residents in the mostly African-American neighborhood gathered near the crime scene and soon began taunting police officers investigating the incident.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-93467" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/milwaukee1.jpg" alt="milwaukee1" width="521" height="391" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/milwaukee1.jpg 640w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/milwaukee1-300x225.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/milwaukee1-262x197.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/milwaukee1-574x431.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 521px) 100vw, 521px"></p>
<p>The taunting continued for some time and then turned violent, with police cars being swarmed and pelted with bricks and rocks as a small-scale riot broke out.</p>
<p>Some 100 protesters engaged in a standoff with police, some of whom had responded in riot gear. As the riot grew in intensity cop cars were stoned and one set aflame.</p>
<p>The conflagration grew from there with other cars being set on fire. A local gas station also became engulfed in flames.</p>
<p>The MPD said that someone in the crowd began firing shots, perhaps in the air, according to the Milwaukee Sentinel. There have yet to be reports of anyone being hit by gunfire.</p>

<p>Police also reported on Twitter that Milwaukee fire fighters were kept from extinguishing the flames because shots were being fired by some of the rioters.</p>
