<p>On November 8, millions of Americans will cast their ballots for president, as well as numerous other down-ballot races. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/70077/why-the-manospheres-fear-of-tradcons-is-misguided-and-cowardly">Given how hostile America has become to men in the past eight years under Obama</a>—as well as <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/92666/if-donald-trump-doesnt-win-were-screwed">Hillary Clinton’s openly anti-male, anti-white platform</a> and <a href="http://www.dangerandplay.com/2016/08/16/hillarysstools-once-you-notice-it-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/">demonstrable mental and physical health problems</a>—the stakes have never been higher in a presidential race.
