“Do you browse 4chan’s /pol/?” (EDGY EDGELORD)</p>
<h3>Bonus text answers</h3>
<p><em>“In light of all that has happened, are you planning to get more involved in the culture war of the west (media/public appearances) or pursuing more EE/SA/Asia ventures and blogging from afar as you get older?” (MICKEYD)</em></p>
<p>I’ll be doing more blogging from afar. I rather be the idea man for young revolutionaries than the guy leading the charge on the battlefield. I want to focus on big ideas more than daily tactics.</p>
<p><em>“Will you ever do another tour, conference, or summit similar to last year?” (THE CITY BACHELOR)</em></p>
<p>Yes, possibly in 2017. Last year’s tour was tons of fun, especially being able to meet so many men in a short amount of time.</p>
<p><em>“Do you see yourself spending more time in the States/returning to live permanently in the future? And if so, why?” (NASCIMENTO)</em></p>
<p>I don’t plan on returning. There are lots of reasons, but the main one has become money. I can easily achieve my ideal lifestyle outside of the United States for a fraction of the cost. If I didn’t have family in the USA, I’d never come back, since it doesn’t have anything that I can’t find elsewhere.</p>
<p><em>“Do you ever get bits of food trapped in the hairs of your beard?” (CAGGYBEAR)</em></p>
<p>Yes, all the time. If I eat a meal with sauce or grease, like a cheeseburger, I pretty much have to take a shower afterwards to clean it.</p>
<p><em>“Given that you’re Europe-based, what is your plan regarding the inevitable future civil conflicts that will erupt in Europe? I.e. leave/stay, move further east, fight etc. ” (PHOENIX)</em></p>
<p>Unless I am rooted to the land and have an ideal survivalist setup, I’d probably leave to safer lands. If I have a family and home in Europe, I’d be more inclined to stay. My backup plan if I leave Europe is Colombia.</p>
<p><em>“Do you intend to grow ROK into a more active alternative news source, i.e. having reporters/correspondents as well as opinion pieces?” (PHOENIX)</em></p>
<p>No, it will not become a news site, because that’s a different ballgame. I want to stay focused on the gender issue and male improvement.</p>
<p><em>“What do you see as your next step(s) in life?” (YOSARRIANS RIGHT)</em></p>
<p>I’d like to make myself more resilient to media attacks, prepare for future world turbulence with more survivalist prepping, be on the lookout for a woman to possibly create a family with, and understand the “relationship game” knowledge that that would require.</p>
<p><em>“Does your fame or notoriety cause you to be recognized publicly in your day to day life. If so are they usually negative or positive experiences from haters or fans?” (JOSH BAR)</em></p>
<p>Haters never approach me alone. Either they yell from a distance or try to get a mob to confront me, like recently happened <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iD_1_U8ETk">in the DNC</a>. Getting recognized comes in spurts. It’s more common in the USA than Europe. It doesn’t happen enough that I’m tired of it.</p>
<p><em>“Would you ever seriously consider getting involved in politics in the US, in the next ten years?” (KAII)</em></p>
<p>No, because that would require me to live in the USA and re-enter an aspect of the rat race, though I’d consider it if Donald Trump calls me to serve in his administration.</p>
<p><em>“What is a skill you’d like to learn and why?” (DARIAN FREY)</em></p>
<p>I’d like to learn more about home improvement, wood working, carpentry, and gardening. I figure these skills will be easier to learn once I move out of the city. I’m ready to build my own castle.</p>
<p><em>“What are your long term writing goals? Dabbling a bit more in fiction or sticking primarily with non-fiction?” (2WYCKED)</em></p>
<p>Nothing in particular, but I will focus mostly on non-fiction. For ideas that are too dangerous, such as challenging the government, I will package them into fiction.</p>
<p><em>“Since the media outrage about the meet ups, has this exposure helped you to sell more books and being recognized by the girls in a sexual way?” (DR COTARD)</em></p>
<p>The increase in book sales and attention came in a wave and then went back down. For me to really take full advantage of exposure, I’d have to be in the middle of the news cycle regularly to constantly expose myself to mainstream audiences, similar to what Mike Cernovich is doing. That’s a job in itself.</p>
<p><em>“Since your newest book launch, have you experienced a renewed interest in your other books?” (DR COTARD)</em></p>
<p>Not too much since they’re so unrelated, but at least now I have an offering for men interested in more free speech and political issues than only game.</p>
