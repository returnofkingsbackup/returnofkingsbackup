<p>Women often lie to seek vengeance against men, and false rape accusations are a serious problem in our society. Women will even make up total fabrications about sexual encounters to ruin a man’s name and reputation. Crime statistics prove this. If you want to get more philosophical about it, a great philosopher from a century ago called it women’s innate instinct of <em>dissimulation</em>. The capacity to dissemble, or lie, is stronger in some women than others. Remember this term when dealing with the repercussions of a false rape or other sexual encounter you had with a woman. That’s the term Arthur Schopenhauer used to describe women and their natural gift of lying:</p>
<blockquote><p>For as lions are furnished with claws and teeth, elephants with tusks, boars with fangs, bulls with horns, and the cuttlefish with its dark, inky fluid, so Nature has provided woman for her protection and defense with the faculty of dissimulation, and all the power which Nature has given to man in the form of bodily strength and reason has been conferred on woman in this form. Hence, dissimulation is innate in woman and almost as characteristic of the very stupid as of the clever. Accordingly, it is as natural for women to dissemble at every opportunity as it is for those animals to turn to their weapons when they are attacked; and they feel in doing so that in a certain measure they are only making use of their rights. Therefore a woman who is perfectly truthful and does not dissemble is perhaps an impossibility.</p></blockquote>

</div>
<p>It also pays to remember this sage wisdom from author Charles Bukowski in his highly-rated book <a href="http://amzn.to/2bXYvxD"><em>Women</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once a woman turns against you, forget it. They can love you, then something turns in them. They can watch you dying in a gutter, run over by a car, and they’ll spit on you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some will even drag you through years of legal system torture just to get back at you. As Bukowski knew, men are dead to women once their utility value has been consumed or they feel they’ve been wronged in some way. This is what you are up against. The good news is, you are not the first man to be falsely accused by a woman, nor will you be the last. The numbers show this is a daily occurrence.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>

</div>
<p>Statistics are all over the place when it comes to how many rape reports are false. Low estimates say 1-2% are false and high estimates say 90% are false. Just know, many studies gathered in the center of the Bell Curve say false rape accusations average as high as 25% when “no crime” committed statistics are included. As a good rough estimate, that’s 1 in 4 reported rapes being false. What a risk we run as men! The Harris and Grace study also reported a full 1 in a 10 or 10.9% of rape reports were purely malicious in intent! These numbers jive with an older study from the 1970s in which scientific, medical evidence showed 3-31% of rape reports were false.</p>
<p>A 2008 survey of law enforcement officials across America showed the majority of cops believe at least 11% and as many as 50% of rape allegations were false reports. To me, this confirms the maliciousness of Anglo women in today’s society, a topic illuminated by Rookh Kshatriya, an English anti-feminist scholar.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Anglobitch Thesis contends that the brand of feminism that arose in the Anglosphere (the English-speaking world) in the 1960s has an ulterior misandrist (anti-male) agenda quite distinct from its self-proclaimed role as ‘liberator’ of women. This derives from a distinct component in Anglo-Saxon culture, namely Puritanism. This puritanical undercurrent gives women an intrinsic sense of entitlement and privilege as ‘owners’ of sex in a cultural context where sex is a scarce commodity (we call this sense of entitlement The Pedestal Syndrome). Because of this, the advance of women’s ‘rights’ across the Anglosphere has not been accompanied by a corresponding reduction of their traditional privileges – indeed, those privileges have only broadened in scope and impact, leaving men only with obligations and women aglow with rights plus privileges. This has been accompanied by an obsessive vilification of men in the Anglo-American media, and across the Anglosphere generally.</p>

<p>So, we’ve established you are up against the natural tendency of women to dissemble, and rape statistics that show a good number of sexual crimes are based on false pretenses, and that you live in a gynocentric, misandrist society. What do you do when the jaws of the metastasizing American police and prison state are looking at you for one of its next meals?</p>
<h3>Know Your Rights</h3>
<div id="attachment_93952" style="width: 378px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-93952" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Jail.jpeg" alt="A New York man spent four years in prison out of a 20 year sentence after a false rape charge" width="368" height="399"><p class="wp-caption-text">A New York man spent four years in prison out of a 20 year sentence after a false rape charge</p>
</div>
<p>Just a woman’s word that you raped her is enough to land you in jail with charges until you bond out. Know that the burden of proof that you did not force a sexual encounter with a woman rests on your shoulders, and her identity will be protected while yours is sullied. That’s the breaks in the injustice system. However, the evidence usually does not hold up, which illustrates how ruthless, vindictive and dissimulating women can be.</p>
<p>Remain calm. Collect yourself. Know you do not have to answer any questions from police without the presence of an attorney. Cooperate with police, but tell them: <em>I am happy to help you, officer, but I want to do that in the presence of my attorney. </em>Even if you are telling the truth, it’s recommended you do all communicating with police about such a serious matter through while your legal counsel is present. A misstep or a misstatement on your part could lead to a false conviction. Those with experience in the law will be able to safely guide you through all the potential landmines. Know that only 7% to 13% of reported rapes end up in a conviction in the U.S. Trials require evidence, and the odds are on your side if you committed no crime.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in its continuing war on heterosexuality, the U.S. (especially states like California) are further backing normal sexual behavior among men into a corner. A “yes means yes” law was recently signed by Jerry Brown, and states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lack of protest or resistance does not mean consent, nor does silence mean consent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, in the insane American legal system you must ask a female every time you have sex, “Can I fuck you now?” Even if it is a steady girlfriend. This only places another potential legal noose around men’s necks.</p>
<div id="attachment_93955" style="width: 486px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class=" wp-image-93955" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Po-300x199.jpg" alt="Get an attorney before any questioning takes place" width="476" height="316" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Po-300x199.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Po-262x173.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Po.jpg 426w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Get an attorney before any questioning takes place</p>
</div>
<p>In some cases, false reports about sexual encounters have ruined men’s lives. A man from England named “Nick” graduated from University with an engineering degree, completing school only after years of legal system hell. He was later acquitted of the crime, but that didn’t stop his name from being drug through the mud and him suffering several years of false accusations because of some girl who wanted to get back at him. His advice is to fight false rape reports like a raging tiger:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="s1">The moment you stop fighting is the moment you lose. You could protest your innocence for the rest of your life if you had to. It doesn’t matter if they don’t believe you, keep fighting. It’s horrible. I wouldn’t wish anyone to go through it, not even my worst enemy. The thing is, if someone knew enough about me they could Google and find out all my case details. If this helps one more person through it then that’s worth it. </span></p></blockquote>
<p>Don’t give up, and don’t let a false rape accusation stand. Some jurisdictions allow the falsely accused, once acquitted, to bring civil action (i.e. sue the hell out of) the false accuser. But, depending on where you live your mileage may vary on that form of recourse. There are some cases in which men have gone on to financially devastate false rape accusers. A Maryland man was recently awarded nearly $1 million after his wife falsely accused him of raping their daughters. The man lost his job and went through 5 years of hell for false accusations invented out of whole cloth.</p>
<p>In another case, a New York woman was sentenced to one to three years in prison for perjury charges. As reported by the New York Post:</p>
<blockquote><p>The woman whose false rape claims put an innocent man behind bars for nearly four years was sentenced to one to three years in prison on perjury charges. After pleading guilty to making up a story that she was gang raped in Upper Manhattan in 2005 to elicit sympathy from friends, Biurny Peguero Gonzalez was hit with jail time. “I question myself every day as to how I could have done this,” she told the judge at her sentencing hearing. Gonzalez’s false accusations lead to a 20-year prison sentence for Bronx construction worker William McCaffrey. That conviction was overturned after Gonzalez underwent a religious conversion and admitted she made up the story.</p></blockquote>
<p>This, gentlemen, is only one of the many risks of dealing with women in a society that pedestalizes them and villainizes men.</p>
<p>We’ve seen how much the media and women like to toss around the rape card these days. The data in this article can be your lifeline when facing this evil in the legal system.</p>
