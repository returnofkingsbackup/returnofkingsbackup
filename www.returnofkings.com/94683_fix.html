<p>Dr. Drew should consider himself lucky for only having his CNN Headline News show canceled a week after not tip-toeing around Hillary Clinton’s obviously questionable health. Why? Because people have a way of <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/93777/hillary-and-bill-clinton-are-criminal-masterminds-wielding-incredible-power">turning up dead</a> when they commit offenses against the Clintons, usually with strange suicides, plane crashes, or car accidents that nobody witnesses.</p>
<p>Only a week before his show’s cancellation, Dr. Drew, along with another medical expert, Dr. Robert Huizenga, said they were “gravely concerned” about Hillary’s health after looking over some of her medical records:</p>
<blockquote><p>We evaluated the medical record that she had released [and] were gravely concerned not just about her health, but her health care. Both of us concluded that if we were providing the care that she was receiving, we’d be ashamed to show up in a doctor’s lounge. She’s receiving 1950s-level care. She’s been treated for hypothyroidism with something called Armour Thyroid, which is very unconventional and something we used back in the 1960s. Armour Thyroid sometimes has some weird side effects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their opinion was based on a convoluted statement released by her doctor, Lisa Bardack, detailing Hillary’s hypothyroidism, allergies, a thrombosis she had in 2012 which resulted in a fall and a concussion, and her use of Fresnel prism glasses. The statement goes on to say Hillary is in good health after detailing a litany of health issues. Drew said on a KABC radio interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The use of Fresnel prism glasses] suggests brain damage. That’s profound.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, even though the KABC interview raised legitimate issues and went viral it was pulled off the web site only hours later. The incident has all the markings of a coverup and Pravda-like shoddy journalism.</p>
<h3>The Coordinated Response</h3>

</div>
<p>What did the mainstream media do in lockstep after Drew and another medical expert expressed concerns about her health? Why, they ran hit pieces, of course. An independent thought alarm sounded as soon as the words came out of Drew’s mouth, and immediately the keyboard brigade went to work to discredit him with smarmy yellow journalism. The Daily Beast turned on him, saying “Dr. Drew Leads the Hillary Clinton Health Truthers.” Yahoo News came out with a damage control article “Fact Checking Dr. Drew on Hillary Clinton’s ‘Medical Records’.” PuffHo said “Speculating About Candidate Health is Mudslinging, Not Medicine.”</p>
<p>The coup de grace in the move to discredit Dr. Drew was his removal from the Clinton News Network a week later, a surprising and sudden cancellation of a show that has been running for five years on the low-rated network. CNN said removing Dr. Drew On Call is part of a so-called “revamping” of its lineup. (Dr. Drew survived the last “revamping” of the lineup). That’s PR speak for <em>we’re firing your ass because you challenged the power structure, Jack.</em> The head cheese of CNN Ken Jautz said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dr. Drew and I have mutually agreed to air the final episode of his show on September 22.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some chick named Ashleigh Banfield will be his likely replacement, posing as a Social Justice Warrior. She promises to deliver her own craptastic blend of CNN-style Communism on a show that will be a “unique brand of social and legal issues.”</p>
<p>CNN has been running regular cover for Clinton, in one case doing a shameless hit piece on the people whose critical thinking skills have not yet been destroyed. They labeled people who have legitimate questions about Hillary’s health as everything from tin-foil hat conspiracy theorists to sexists. Who were their sources for telling them Hillary is in excellent health in the report assailing people wanting to know if Hillary is sick or not? Why Hillary herself, Syphilis Bill, and one of their long-time employees. What journalistic integrity! That report wouldn’t have passed muster in an entry level journalism class, but it was good enough for CNN’s lightweight talking head Randi Kaye to expect you to believe it.</p>

</div>
<p>We serfs aren’t supposed to notice Hillary’s bizarre coughing incidents, the seizure-like head bobbling, her being carried up a flight of steps, her cover story about her health that’s weak as water, and we are supposed to ignore an increasing chorus line of doctors saying something is wrong with the old harridan. It’s not just Dr. Drew and Dr. Huizenga. <span class="st">Rutgers University Professor of Medicine Bob Lahita came out saying concerns over Hillary’s health are no conspiracy theory. Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons also called into question the mainstream media narratives about Clinton’s health. Are we supposed to believe these medical experts are all crazy conspiracy theorists, too?</span></p>
<p>Interestingly, Wonder Woman (Clinton) hasn’t held a campaign press conference in over eight months and shuns the spotlight whenever possible, increasingly living the life of a recluse rather than a presidential candidate.</p>
<p>To make matters worse as the left attempts to tighten the noose around the necks of those who don’t follow their dictates, The New York Times is calling for Google to censor search results that call into question the increasingly bizarre narratives that claim Hillary is as healthy as a spring chicken.</p>
<p>What we are witnessing is the internet doing the job journalists won’t do, and as people get closer to the truth of an issue the media’s actions and inactions become increasingly ridiculous. Chalk Dr. Drew’s cancellation up to a desperate move by a desperate Hivemind fighting to stay relevant in an age when they’re increasingly shown to be shameless, lying propagandists.</p>
<p>The closer we get to the truth about any topic on the internet, the more outrageous and shrill the calls will become to censor and silence us. Blood has been drawn when it comes to a sickly Hillary.</p>
