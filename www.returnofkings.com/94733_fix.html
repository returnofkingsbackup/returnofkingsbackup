“Roosh, from your recent posts I gather that you are looking for a woman to bond with and start a family. You’ve already explained what you are looking for, but I am more interested in learning where (i.e. which country/region) you will start your search in and for which reasons you have chosen that specific country? Ideally I would like to have kids too, but I know that it will become increasingly difficult in our world to find a loyal and kind woman with whom it is worth taking the risks of starting a family.” (DER WELTENBUMMLER)</p>

Yet “Bang”ing them seems to be counterproductive to that goal (as opposed to enjoying the decline into a new dark ages).

<p>That completely wraps up the 2016 Q&amp;A series. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/rooshv">my Youtube channel</a> for all seven videos, which total almost six hours in length. I didn’t know what kind of time commitment I was getting into by doing this Q&amp;A, but it came out great and it was a lot of fun to answer all 131 questions.</p>
