<p>When I was young, my parents would reward me when I did well in school. I got good grades all throughout high school and college, but good grades was never my personal goal.</p>
<p>When I was in my early 20s, I went to work for a corporation. My bosses would reward me with praise and money when I worked hard in the laboratory, but working hard in that field was not something I really wanted.</p>
<p>Whenever I got a new bang, I told my friends and they congratulated me. This reward caused me to pursue bangs that I otherwise wouldn’t have. I was thrusting the girl not just for me, but for my friends.</p>
<p>Whenever I got a new flag, I published a story on my blog or in a book. My readers rewarded me with their praise, causing me to chase flags longer than I had originally planned.</p>
<p>Whenever I sell a new book, I’m rewarded with money, causing me to write more books.</p>
<p>Whenever a girl compliments me on my strength, I work out even harder in the gym.</p>
<p>Whenever a man compliments me on my outfit, I think of new ways to better my style.</p>
<p>Am I not a machine that just seeks validation in others, in both obvious and subtle forms?</p>

<p>How much of my desire truly comes from within, and how much is determined by reward or punishment? Why do I feel more reward from a bang than the average man? Why do I feel less reward from money? Haven’t the goals we have in life been shaped for years by <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/destiny-is-real">influences outside of our immediate control</a>? How much say do we really have in the goals we set for ourselves? If I was put on an island, alone, at a young age, wouldn’t my wants be quite different than they are now? How much different?</p>
<p>I’d like to believe that there is a strong genetic component to my being. I want to believe that my ancestors have determined my destiny, but it’s hard to come to that conclusion. I’m nothing more than a man of my times, shaped by a wave of civilization that determines the majority of my behavior and thinking. I think we are all men of our times, and had we been born in a different era, we wouldn’t even recognize ourselves in the mirror.</p>
