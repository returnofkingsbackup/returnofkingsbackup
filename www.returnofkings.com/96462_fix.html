<p>Gentlemen, we live in an age of unprecedented rapidity of change. The West’s infrastructure, culture, and technology have changed more in the past 20 years than they have in the past 100. It is not an overstatement to say that job security is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>So, what’s a man to do in such uncertain times? Well, I propose that you must take your own financial success into your own hands. It will no longer do to trust a giant corporation to take care of you, and to be honest, this type of thinking is childish and entitled.</p>
<p>If you want to break free of the rat race and become financially independent, it is possible… if you’re willing to put in the work. Very many men in the manosphere have not only left their day jobs behind, but are earning far more than they ever did before.</p>
<p>Roosh, Victor Pride, Mike Cernovich, Matt Forney, Stefan Molyneux, and more men all over the West have started to realize the pointlessness of working your whole life for a corporation. Instead, why not choose to become a self-employed man? If you don’t think it can be done, simply look at the last five names that I rattled off. That’s only a fraction of a fraction of the men who have escaped the rat race.</p>
<p>Escaping the grind is 100% possible, and in fact, will only take several years if you know what you’re doing. So, with this in mind, here’s four tips for men trying to break free.</p>
<h3>1. Learn to Invest</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96472" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Dices-Cubes-With-The-Words-Sel-43608985-702x3361.jpg" width="500" height="239" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Dices-Cubes-With-The-Words-Sel-43608985-702x3361.jpg 702w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Dices-Cubes-With-The-Words-Sel-43608985-702x3361-300x144.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Dices-Cubes-With-The-Words-Sel-43608985-702x3361-667x319.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Dices-Cubes-With-The-Words-Sel-43608985-702x3361-262x125.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/bigstock-Dices-Cubes-With-The-Words-Sel-43608985-702x3361-574x275.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>One of the most basic tenets of being able to escape the rat race is not just to earn money, but to protect your money and make it grow for YOU. In fact, this is probably one of the most <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1356" target="_blank">fundamental principles of wealth</a>: the poor work for money, the rich have money work for them.</p>
<p>It only takes a modicum of thought to realize the folly of working for money. If you can only work 16 hours in a day, you are limited to 16 hours’ worth of money. This is why it is crucial to shift your paradigm. Don’t think of money and time as a linear trade (aka 1 hour = $15). Think of time as an INVESTMENT in money.</p>
<p>There are two types of investments: time and money. That’s it. You can either invest time, or you can invest money…and I would argue that you should do both. Every time you’re faced with spending your time to earn money, ask yourself: will this earn me money for JUST this hour? Or will this time investment continue to earn me money for the following years to come?</p>
<p>In other words, learn to create residual income. It is better to spend 1000 hours investing in a business structure, and earning $500 during this period, but then gaining $15,000 every month for the rest of your life. Again, switch your paradigm: don’t TRADE time for money. INVEST time for money.</p>
<p>The second way that you can invest, is with money. Now, I’m not going to sugar coat this and bullshit you—it is very possible to lose money in the stock market, or in whatever investments you partake in. That being said, however, the stock market is not at all like “gambling,” as some people think.</p>
<p>If you learn to read the signs and predict the upswings and downswings with even a small amount of accuracy, you will make a very large killing in the market. “But Jon,” I’m sure you’re asking. “How do I learn to trade the market?”</p>
<p>That’s a great question—there’s a lot of so called gurus out there claiming that they’ll help you double or even triple your money in a year. But, when you ask them for proof, they completely shy away. Now, I’m not by any means claiming to be an expert on the market, but <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1239" target="_blank">I did recently gain 268% in 5 months</a> from precious metals investing. Compare that to Wall Street’s average gain of 10% per year, and it’s pretty impressive.</p>
<p>All in all, the key is to get started. Consider reading the article that I just linked to, or maybe buying some books on the stock market (The Intelligent Investor is a great one). The point is to get started. If you’re unsure of where to start and don’t want to take huge risks, just invest in some simple, stable stocks or bonds; save ETF’s and mutual funds for when you’re more experienced.</p>
<h3>2. Monetize Your Passion</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96474" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061.jpg" width="500" height="345" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061.jpg 1024w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061-300x207.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061-768x530.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061-837x577.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061-667x460.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061-262x181.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/addtext_com_MDkyOTAzMTEzMjE3-1024x7061-574x396.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>As many others, such as renowned entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, have said before, if you want to make it big you have to follow your passion. Now, I get that this can sound like complete hippie garbage to someone who has been in the rat race for the last three decades, but let me explain.</p>
<p>When you’re stuck in the rat race, you don’t see things the same way that an entrepreneur does; you only see the opportunities that are GIVEN to you. “Hmm, I could get this job doing something I hate for $150,000 a year or I could follow my passion as a teacher and get paid $35,000 a year…I think I’ll choose the former.”</p>
<p>Obviously you can’t follow your passion if you expect others to just give you an opportunity to do so, but if you take the mindset of an entrepreneur it is entirely possible. Think about it: dozens of highly intelligent revolutionaries have told us to follow our passions. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Sam Walton, George Lucas…why is it that they all say the same thing?</p>
<p>Because when you take a leap of faith, and <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=923" target="_blank">learn to monetize your passion</a>, great things happen. Rather than taking an employee’s mindset and looking around to see who can help you, you take the mindset of an entrepreneur and look where you can SEIZE opportunities.</p>
<p>I know that this may not seem like a big shift, but it’s massive: employees look for others to give them success, entrepreneurs look to CREATE it themselves. I don’t care what it is that you’re passionate about; whether it’s creating the best flamenco guitar music in the world or traveling across South America and tasting expertly crafted artisan coffees.</p>
<p>If you’re passionate about it, there’s a way to monetize it. All you have to do is ask yourself a very simple question: how can I make others pay me to do what I love to do? I realize that this question may not be very helpful to a newbie entrepreneur, so I’ll help you answer it.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>Let’s say you’re passionate about lifting weights (like I am). Okay—so how do you get others to pay you for this? Well, you don’t. Rather, you create a BRAND and get others to pay you for your KNOWLEDGE. Start a blog, a YouTube channel, a twitter, and a Facebook for your company. Start putting out content several times a week.</p>
<p>Over time, you’ll get a following. People will see you as an expert for simply talking about what you love to do. Talk about the best pre-workouts on the market, the best bicep exercises, how to do intermittent fasting…talk about whatever you want.</p>
<p>Then, once you’re getting around 1k viewers a day, launch an eBook…which brings me to my next tip.</p>
<h3>3. Learn to Write eBooks</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96473" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell_ebooks1.jpg" width="500" height="229" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell_ebooks1.jpg 700w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell_ebooks1-300x137.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell_ebooks1-667x305.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell_ebooks1-262x120.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sell_ebooks1-574x262.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>With the advent of the digital world, authors no longer have to go through broken, bureaucratic publishing companies to get their work out there. Prior to the internet, it was not uncommon for amazing authors to have their work turned down by 30 or 40 different publishing companies.</p>
<p>And then, on the off chance that they got their work accepted, they would only keep about 20% of the profits. But now, you can literally <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1440" target="_blank">create and sell an eBook within a couple of weeks</a>. and you get to keep anywhere from 30% to 100% of the profit.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a blog, which I’m assuming most of you reading this probably don’t, then I would opt to sell an eBook through Amazon’s Kindle store. You keep a relatively decent percentage of the profits (I believe from 30-60% depending on how high you price it) and you expose your work to literally millions of book browsers every day.</p>
<p>If you have your own blog with a relatively large following, however, creating an eBook and selling it through your blog will allow you to keep 100% of the profit. This is what guys like Roosh, Matt Forney, Victor Pride, and I do. By selling eBooks through our blogs we can charge whatever we want for it, create a sales page, and keep 100% of the profits. Sure, it’s more work—but it pays off in the long run.</p>
<p>“But Jon! What if I have nothing to write about?” I can hear someone ask. Trust me, you have something to write about. What are you knowledgeable about? All of that nerdy stuff that never got you laid is an opportunity to make some money now.</p>
<p>Do you know how to create a computer from scratch? Okay, then write about that. Are you an expert at cultivating your own garden? Then write about that. Or maybe you’re an expert at <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=990981&amp;cl=79071&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=313062" target="_blank">banging girls that you meet during the day</a>. Then write about that.</p>
<p>Whatever you write about, the point is that you need to be very knowledgeable about it. Guys can sense when you’re bullshitting them, and that’s no way to sell a quality product. If you’re going to write an eBook, be sure that you have at least a few years of experience with what it is that you’re writing about—preferably even more.</p>
<h3>4. Utilize Freelancing Platforms</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96475" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1.jpg" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1.jpg 1280w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1-768x432.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1-1200x675.jpg 1200w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3051519-poster-1280-how-job-prepared-me-for-freelance1-574x323.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Over the past five years, tons and tons of online freelancing platforms have emerged. Sites like Fiverr, 99Designs, DogVacay, Upwork, and Elance, have created a new type of economy, where artists and skilled individuals don’t have to rely on any sort of boss or location to get paid.</p>
<p>I actually decided to make a Fiverr around 2 years back as a joke; my friend told me that there were people who sold spells on eBay and made $100’s of dollars a day. “There’s no way anyone can be that stupid,” I thought. “Look it up,” he said.</p>
<p>After verifying his claim, I decided to make a Fiverr “removing curses,” for the low, low fee of $5 per curse. Within a couple of weeks I was earning around $20 a day, sometimes earning up to $50 a day if someone needed a very powerful, ancient curse removed (for an extra fee, of course).</p>
<p>I actually shut it down a while back, because I felt kind of like a dick for taking advantage of complete retards (although if you choose to do so, I won’t judge you), but the point is that there’s some good money to be made online if you’re willing to put in the work.</p>
<p>If you have any sort of skill or product that can be sold digitally, I guarantee you, there’s a market for it. Are you a good writer? You can get paid anywhere from $25-100 an hour to write high quality articles or proofread others’ work.</p>
<p>Can you use Adobe Photoshop? There’s guys out there who literally make $100’s of dollars a day just from photo-shopping abs into peoples’ pictures. Literally any skill that you have can be used to make money online. “But Jon, I don’t have any skills!” I can hear you say.</p>
<p>Can you talk? Okay—there’s people who will pay you to record testimonials or to record a few hundred words. And if you actually have a highly sought-after skill like coding or graphic design, you can forget about it. You’ll easily rake in a six figure salary.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Although this isn’t the “definitive guide” to making money online, it’s certainly a start. Remember, though: it all starts with your mindset. Learn to see the opportunities that others can’t see, and learn to believe that if you put in the work, you’ll get the results.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a quick buck, definitely don’t go the blogging route—blogging takes a long time to make money from, but if you’re willing to put in the effort, it’s worth it. If you’re looking for slow and steady income gains, consider investing in the stock market as well.</p>
<p>For a much faster income, go with the freelancing option or consider writing eBooks and selling them on Amazon. There’s an infinite amount of opportunity out there, you just have to develop the confidence and drive to take advantage of it. I have, millions of other men have, and you can too.</p>
