<p>The word “nice” has become negatively connoted since it has been associated with being a nice guy. Before, niceness was a virtue, equated with gentleness, goodness, respectfulness. It was part of the courtship process, as a “nice” man would take his time to know the gal he was courting, organize dates and social activities with her—and this was legitimate as long as the gal cared about him, or bothered about looking as if she cared, as much as he did with her. Some conservatives have even claimed that niceness was a basic element of sociability.</p>
<p>Now, niceness has been ousted as a negative feature by almost everyone with a skin in the game. Feminists crucified nice guys as “hypocrites,” because, y’know, a heterosexual man cannot be nice, cishet are just a bunch of oppressors, and how do nice guys dare to have their own interests and desires at all, and so on. In the manosphere, niceness is often equated with betaness, inability to take action, living inside the illusions of the blue pill, and the surest way to loserdom.</p>
<p>Neither <a href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2015/08/science-and-politics-in-academe-good-research-is-not-enough/" target="_blank">metapolitics</a> in general nor the red pill in particular can be described as nice: metapolitics mean cultural fight, unmasking the mainstream worldview and ideas, pushing ours, all these often indirectly; and the red pill teaches us that negging girls, kicking their ego, escalating when we can, are part of being confident and getting notches.</p>
<p>Yet the very notion of niceness does not deserve to be universally condemned and rejected. In a normal society, people are nice or at least try to be nice to each other, if only to their closest friends and kin. In the world where courtship worked, having interests and desires did not mean one had to play the jerk in order to basically succeed. And though <em>we</em> cannot be nice to anyone, if at least some girls are, society ends up much happier and peaceful than if everyone must keep jerking around to pretend his life is a success.</p>
<p>This is what I want to talk about today: not about the nice guy—whom I would like to mention again eventually for other reasons—but about a far less acknowledged figure we might call the nice gal.</p>
<h3>The quiet trad girl</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96522" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl3.jpg" alt="introgirl3" width="600" height="326" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl3.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl3-300x163.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl3-262x142.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl3-574x312.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Now I’m not talking about the so-called <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/88099/why-the-female-anti-feminist-is-a-feminist-in-disguise" target="_blank">anti-feminist females</a> who, although they may be helping us on the struggle for the cultural victory of neomasculinity, tend to use it for attention-whoring purposes. What I’m talking about is this kind of girl who, even if she does not say it explicitly and does not know it herself, is still somehow innocent, avoids getting knocked by new guys at every weekend and longs for something akin to the white picked fence dream.</p>
<p>This girl has been derided as a wilful slave by feminists who, like <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/72572/why-is-there-a-prolific-jewish-presence-in-the-american-feminist-movement" target="_blank">Betty Friedan</a>, compared the privileged life of an upper middle class housewife to a concentration camp (!). She might be passed on by PUAs who will see her shyness and resistance as a loss of time for themselves. But, on the other hand, such a girl makes for an excellent long term relationship material, and though she is often hard to both find and fuck, she is also someone you can trust as a partner.</p>
<p>Here are some of the nice gal’s features:</p>
<h4><strong>Though hard to have sex with, she turns (and remains) emotionally loyal and affectionate</strong></h4>
<p>At the beginning of the dates, she will block your escalation moves but also stays in touch with you, cares about your well-being, and does not fuck around when she does so. Her vibe is very different from the usual girl who pretends to be into you, but has no time to share your company, does not actually care about you and has sex with at least one other guy at the same time. The basic feature of the nice gal is that she cares—and not about her Instagram, Facebook, or getting invited to the next popular and fashionable party next door. With practice and disappointments, differentiating between the girl who actually cares and the girl who pretends to do so but is just another phony becomes easier.</p>
<h4><strong>She may be superficially a leftist, as most university girls are today, but will accept your politics</strong></h4>
<p>When you are still dating her, you can do some jests about, say, the good side of the dissenters (us) versus the ugly side of current power; she may say you are macho but won’t  go overdrive shrieking and screaming. Eventually, when you are nailing her on a regular basis, you can be honest about politics, teach her about the <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/62716/the-damaging-effects-of-jewish-intellectualism-and-activism-on-western-culture" target="_blank">Jewish power</a>, how native Europeans are getting displaced, or how feminism actually engineered a sex war and ruined families. She may argue a bit—just a bit—and, incrementally, will get convinced that what you say and believe is right and true provided your frame is strong enough.</p>
<h4><strong>Speaking with her is genuinely pleasant</strong></h4>
<p>Framing, bantering, escalating are of course on the menu, yet doing all this creates a good vibe and allows you to lead true conversations. The seduction process does not feel like a tedious struggle to keep her attention, escalating before she flakes or getting exposed to massive amounts of bullshit from another spoiled brat who thinks she knows it all.</p>
<h4><strong>She only slept with a few guys before</strong></h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-17154" src="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blurred-lines_hot_dog.jpg" alt="blurred-lines_hot_dog" width="435" height="245" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blurred-lines_hot_dog.jpg 652w, wp-content/uploads/2013/09/blurred-lines_hot_dog-620x350.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 435px) 100vw, 435px"></p>
<p>If she is young enough, she may be a virgin, and if she is, she will be quite shy given that a “late” virgin girl often gets mocked by other girls as “retarded” or unable to have fun. Here again, be careful not to confuse her with the typical Western girl who chronically lies about the number of guys she actually had sex with. A truly nice gal does not really want to have sex with numerous guys: she wants to reserve herself to one guy, and at worse practices serial monogamy, not random hookups.</p>

<h4>She is physically average or slightly above</h4>
<p>Most girls who grow hot early in life quickly know way too much about their power over men and other girls, and wielding such a power destroys niceness, especially in a world that celebrates irresponsible slutiness. Being physically average, the nice gal will sometimes be approached and complimented like almost every young girl, but much less than hotter girls, and she won’t be deemed interesting by the alpha males pursuing hotter and easier lays—a condition which restrains her natural hypergamy.</p>
<h4>She’s got friends, of course, but is not too dependent on them and on what they say</h4>
<p>You don’t have to be accepted by a mother hen inside her group to be able to approach her. Nor is she too dependent on fashion and entertainment culture. In her case, some shyness and distance from the mainstream sociability mean preserving her integrity. A nice guy living through such a condition will die off by failing to achieve anything meaningful, but a nice gal can preserve herself for becoming a housewife, and this matters a lot.</p>
<h4>Sometimes, she has a <em>personnalité empruntée</em>
</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>This means that she acts this or that way in front of her friends, but what she does has a strange vibe of fakeness. If you find a girl who seems to satisfy the aforementioned conditions and feels a bit strange or fake, it is up to you to dive deep enough—mentally and physically—if she can be considered nice or not. Often, the nice gal with such a personality won’t even know that she has one. The incongruent mask turned into a second nature. Fortunately, nature isn’t that plastic, and an incongruent second nature means contradictions and repression inside, which in turn reveal as explosiveness in bed.</p>
<h4>She often has developed feminine virtue</h4>
<p>For example, she knows to cook a proper meal or do a massage to a man who’s tired. She may have learned these virtues from her parents or has been spontaneously attracted to practising them: in any case, the very fact of having retained them is a proof of genuine femininity. Needless to say, she has no more than a few <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/38722/35-signs-the-girl-youre-dating-is-a-whore" target="_blank">whore signs</a>, or none at all.</p>
<h3>Where can one meet such girls?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96523" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/love_introvert.jpg" alt="love_introvert" width="600" height="315" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/love_introvert.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/love_introvert-300x158.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/love_introvert-262x138.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/love_introvert-574x301.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>Nice gals are undoubtedly easier to meet outside the West. Everything else equal, the most traditional a society, the nicer the girls one can find there. As for myself, having lived a couple of years in Brazil, I have found some easy lays there, but also a variety of gals who still did not have sex with too many guys, enjoyed more the quieter events and definitely became attached after but a few time. One of these girls was a fake hipster whose problem glasses hid a refreshing gentleness and some political openness. Another one was a journalist who worked for a Leftist party, but accepted your humble servant for the outspoken libertarian he was before taking more of the red pill.</p>
<p>This may stem from the fact that Brazilians still have a strong family culture and that so-called “gender” roles are still quite clear to them. A decent amount of girls there prefer going back to their family home in the hinterland during weekends over partying at the city center. It won’t help the PUA to get his lays—although, in Brazil, there seems to be enough girls in most places to satisfy the PUAs—but is definitely good news for those who are looking for long term relationships.</p>
<h3>Et alors?</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96524" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl1.jpg" alt="introgirl1" width="600" height="404" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl1.jpg 600w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl1-300x202.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl1-262x176.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/introgirl1-574x386.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></p>
<p>If you happen to score a notch with a nice gal, you are technically free to pump and dump her, but seriously, avoid doing too much of that. As everyone knowledgeable enough knows, the more partners a girl has before marriage, the more likely she is to divorce, and to divorce soon. Thus, if a girl gets pumped and dumped by too many PUAs, she might be whorified for life and unable to support a family over the long term.</p>
<p>Concerning the nice gal, her shyness and reserve tend to protect her from the PUA, but some players are smart enough to get the notch before moving to other girls. If this happens too much to her, who deep down wants more than hookups and drunk parties, she may turn disillusioned and sour… and prey for the feminists.</p>
<p>A nice gal is part of a normal, today non-mainstream world. Look at your mothers, grandmothers, grand-grandmothers and you are more than likely to find women who once were nice gals. These were home pillars, and they are necessary to sustain a future, for a <em>Brave New World</em> humanity where children are engineered and grown out of the womb is barely human at all.</p>
<p>The path of the notches is, or has been, a necessary step for most of us. We gain experience, autonomy, ability, even dignity by achieving the opening of a girl’s legs. But this is so because we live in an abnormal and somehow savage world. In a normal world, boys receive experience and modelling from their fathers, and girls are much more trustworthy and altruistic than they are today. In a normal world, a guy did simply not need to score many notches as to exist or pretend to be a success, and men could go to the brothels in order to get some extramarital pussy without endangering the whole social fabric.</p>
<p>Now, being precautious and “respectful” in general towards girls would amount to <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/59435/society-needs-a-good-dose-of-white-knight-shaming">white knighting</a> and be a failing strategy. But if you happen to meet a girl who is still more than an <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/women-have-reduced-themselves-to-sexual-commodities" target="_blank">oil pit for sex</a>, perhaps you should marry her and consider having children, especially if you can do so outside the US as to escape its repressive, anti-men divorce laws. As long as the nice gal remains nice and as you reward her for being so, she will likely be a good mother, lover, and householder.</p>
