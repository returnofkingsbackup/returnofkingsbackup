<p>This is intended as a public service announcement of sorts. There is a new red pill sketch comedy that readers would do well to check out. <em>Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace</em> (<em>MDEp:WP</em>) began airing in early August as part of the Adult Swim programming block on Cartoon Network.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/I-KNQRQJ-sk.html" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>In an era of stifling political correctness, <em>MDEp:WP</em> is a welcome breath of fresh air. The sketch comedy is the brainchild of comedian Sam Hyde, who cut his chops doing controversial stand-up routines, creating scathing YouTube videos, and trolling college campuses.</p>
<p><iframe src="../www.youtube.com/embed/-yFhR1fKWG0.html" width="400" height="225" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>With <em>MDEp:WP</em>, Hyde and his comedy troupe have achieved mainstream success with the show drawing nearly one million weekly viewers. However, the irreverence of <em>MDEp:WP</em> has not gone unnoticed by the establishment and the show has come into the crosshairs of BuzzFeed, which has already written two hit pieces: “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-alt-right-has-its-own-comedy-tv-show-on-a-time-warner-ne">The Alt-Right Has Its Very Own TV Show On Adult Swim</a>” and “<a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/neo-nazi-promo-adult-swim-million-dollar-extreme?utm_term=.gqq996nVd#.hpvmm8Nd9">The Underground Neo-Nazi Promo Campaign Behind Adult Swim’s Alt-Right Comedy Show</a>.”</p>
<p><em>MDEp:WP</em> incorporates many references that regular readers of RoK will undoubtedly be familiar with: pick up artistry (PUA), game, peacocking, the wall, and female hypergamy. <em>MDEp:WP</em> is absurdist comedy at its finest. The show has a definite Kafkaesque feel to it that somehow manages to perfectly capture the ridiculousness, isolation, and hollowness of modern existence. The psychedelic camera work, vivid color effects, and ethereal soundtrack cleverly enhance the surreal dream-like atmosphere of the show.</p>
<p>Below is a brief overview of the episodes, with red pill truths and memorable quotes from each episode.</p>

<p>“Welcome back to ‘The Wall Show,’ the show where 30 stops being a number and starts being an unescapable way of life.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to commit right away and give ‘em access to your bank accounts?”</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It seems 2016 is the year that the Alt-Right enters the mainstream. Too large to ignore any longer, those on the right who are disillusioned with milquetoast conservatives and RINOs (Republicans In Name Only) have received recognition from both presidential candidates. And now the Alt-Right has a hit comedy series on a major network. So what can you do? Watch the show. Tell your friends and family to watch it. Share clips on social media. Incorporate phrases and quotes from the show into your daily lexicon.</p>
<p>The establishment is already trying to pressure cable providers to stop carrying <em>MDE. </em>We must all do what we can to make sure <em>MDE </em>is picked up for another season.</p>
