<p>Future President Donald Trump’s established record of success with women is no secret. The guy has game and it is a given. Supermodels, Playboy centerfolds, you name it, The Don banged it.</p>
<h4>Take away his money, what is left?</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96821" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0.jpg" alt="donaldthrowingmoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0" width="399" height="260" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0.jpg 625w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0-300x195.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0-262x171.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DonaldThrowingMoney-620x404-02016_05_14_16_40_58-0-574x374.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px"></p>
<p>It cannot be denied that his fame added to his large financial resources are an aphrodisiac for women. It is simple biology in action. But in addition of his status, Donald can count on other traits like confidence or insane self-love.</p>
<p>Game denialists would be prompt to say ” Well, he only scores because he has money.” But people like Mark Zuckerberg are billionaires but still cannot bed beautiful women, why?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96822" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BN-JQ958_FBZuck_G_20150731151205.jpg" alt="bn-jq958_fbzuck_g_20150731151205" width="400" height="267" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BN-JQ958_FBZuck_G_20150731151205.jpg 553w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BN-JQ958_FBZuck_G_20150731151205-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/BN-JQ958_FBZuck_G_20150731151205-262x175.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></p>
<p>Because Zuckerberg is a doormat. Even with billions, he is an effeminate lab rat with poor posture that can only bang an Asian 5 to prevent his genes from vanishing from the surface of the Earth. His perceived fragility and his palpable weakness can magically turn any vagina dry.</p>
<p>Trump’s past as an entrepreneur and businessman refined his frame to turn it rock-solid. He is in excellent health (<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/93070/8-images-that-hillary-does-not-want-you-to-see">compared to his opponent</a>) but his mindset is even stronger and the undeniable key to his victories. He has been through trial and failure and this made his resolve and drive exceptional, hence his success with the ladies.</p>
<h4>A short reminder</h4>

<p>His three wives. Obviously the shortest union of the three was with the American one. Let that be a warning. Her are some notable examples which confirm that DJT is a game natural:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-96805" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/124869_sandra-taylor.jpg" alt="124869_sandra-taylor" width="300" height="214" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/124869_sandra-taylor.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/124869_sandra-taylor-262x187.jpg 262w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>1. Between wives, he met Sandra Taylor (pictured above), a Penthouse Pet of the Month, took her out for pizza, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3202153/Donald-Trump-AMAZING-bed-claims-former-Penthouse-Pet-presidential-hopeful-secretary-track-spotting-sexy-magazine-spread.html">banged her, gave her a signed copy of the Art of the Deal and told her to change her name</a>, for better career prospects.</p>
<p>2. He dropped the nuclear <a href="https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/the-reality-of-game-trump-negs-klum-she-responds-predictably/">“Neg of the Century”</a> on aging and now irrelevant ex-model Heidi Klum with the savage “She’s great, but no longer a 10,” giving her and her white knights daily seizures. She tried to defend herself as he knocked her off balance, counter attacked in a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/18/politics/donald-trump-heidi-klum-no-longer-a-ten/">poor and predictable fashion</a>, but the blade did hit the bone. She has not slept since.</p>
<p>3. These gems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an interview with Vanity Fair, while he was still married to Ivana, Trump said:</p>
<p>“I would never buy Ivana any decent jewels or pictures. Why give her negotiable assets?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Trump: The Art of the Comeback </em>on prenuptial agreements:</p>
<p>“There are basically three types of women and reactions. One is the good woman who very much loves her future husband, solely for himself, but refuses to sign the agreement on principle. I fully understand this, but the man should take a pass anyway and find someone else. The other is the calculating woman who refuses to sign the prenuptial agreement because she is expecting to take advantage of the poor, unsuspecting sucker she’s got in her grasp. There is also the woman who will openly and quickly sign a prenuptial agreement in order to make a quick hit and take the money given to her.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>A winner mindset</h4>

<p>This is the same drive and mental solidity that helped him deflect all the blows that the establishment directed at him, which allowed him to surge in the polls and in real life, coming from the status of political farce to possible President of the US.</p>
<p>He is banging the media and his opponents silly just like he does with his previous lovers. And what is interesting is that he uses almost the same approach in both cases: he does not give a damn and plows through.</p>
<p>He shows us that game not only helps you bed pretty girls but also ensures you greater success in business and status related activities like politics. He proves that it is all in the mind. DJT assumes the sale before it takes place which is one of the pillars of inner game.</p>
<p>Whatever the amount of flak her receives or the curved balls his enemies throw, it rolls on him like rain drops on a raincoat.</p>

<p>Two of his recent stunts royally pissed off the mainstream media and serve as a reminder that his romantic skills, transferred to politics, still find the mark.</p>

<p>Last week, Donald Trump used the whole “Birther” controversy, not adding any comment on the issue but tipping a journalist that “they had to keep the suspense going,” letting them craving for more information.</p>
<p>It brought the media in droves to witness what he had say during his Washington conference, hoping for a juicy statement that they could then exploit against him. They all eagerly turned up but the whole event was entirely focus on Donald’s support from veterans, Medal of Honor winners and retired flag officers.</p>
<p>Through this, he managed to bring the spotlight on the unfair treatment of veterans under the Obama administration, a cause that does not interest America’s traditional media.</p>
<p>Nothing was said about the whole “Birther” issue and the coyotes of the mainstream media left enraged and empty handed. In the words of CNN, it was one of the first, if not the first, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2016/09/16/birther-cnn-donald-trump-political-rick-roll/">political RIck Roll</a>. Just like with women, anticipation was cultivated and brought to climax before the coup de grâce.</p>

<p>He also responded brilliantly to the “<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/09/16/hillary-clinton-christians-are-bigoted-and-deplorable-religious-liberty-code-for-discrimination/">basket of deplorables</a>” label that Hillary Clinton used to describe the Trump campaign and its supporters.</p>

<p>In a textbook example of “<a href="https://heartiste.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/relationship-game-week-agree-and-amplify/">Agree and Amplify</a>“, sporting his trademark shit eating grin, The Donald entered the stage of his Miami rally with the “Can You Hear The People Sing” soundtrack of the famous musical “Les Misérables,” assorted with a huge banner featuring the name “Les Deplorables.”</p>
<p>He embraces the notion of Deplorables, showing that just like the used and abused “racist,” a buzzword has no power and no weight. It is only used to silence a fragile opposition.</p>
<p>Just like the millennial girl that was teased and says “OMG you are such an asshole. I can’t even”, to which the panty wetter answers “And you love every minute of it”, Trump tells Clinton: “Deplorable”? Nice ring to it. Is that all you got?”</p>

<h4>Donald J. Trump, président du game</h4>

<p>Amused Mastery.</p>
<p>His whole philosophy can be narrowed down to this fundamental aspect of game. Trump uses Jerkboy-Asshole game because the American media reflects the image of a majority of American women: slutty, vulgar, leftist and only good for one thing: being pumped and dumped.</p>
<p>In the presence of a neutral, receptive and honest media, Trump would tone down the asshole game and would not be as aggressive as he is now. Exactly like a game-savvy man would use<a href="http://www.rooshv.com/3-principal-types-of-game"> light game when he is not on American soil.</a></p>
<p>Despite his apparent qualities, it is a fact that Trump is not the panacea to the totality of America’s problem. But among the great measures he could take as acting president of the United States, observing his masculinity and game techniques alone could act as a great inspiration for the next generation of men striving for romantic and political success.</p>
