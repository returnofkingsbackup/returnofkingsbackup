<p>Recently I’ve been re-reading <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1474686270&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=THe+48+Laws+of+Power&amp;tag=rok0f-20" target="_blank">The 48 Laws Of Power By Robert Greene</a></em>. In this phenomenal book, Mr. Greene scours history for examples of men and women ruthlessly seizing power without any regards as to who may be hurt.</p>
<p>As I was re-reading this excellent work, I started to realize just how many of these tactics women use on men…every day. In fact, it’s so common place that most men don’t even notice it happening. Whether she’s using sex as a way to make you perform all sorts of ridiculous favors, or viciously taking advantage of <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1088" target="_blank">your lack of masculinity</a>, you can pretty much guarantee that she’s following one, or many of these laws of power.</p>
<p>Women are masters at manipulating men; after all, they can’t beat us physically, so they have to rely on something else. Whereas our battlefield is the physical realm, their battlefield is fought in the emotional realm. And, as is the case in any battle, you must arm yourself with knowledge.</p>
<p>Here’s 5 Machiavellian tactics that women use on men every day.</p>
<h3>Law #3: Conceal Your Intentions</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96915" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/41ba7692-7a53-468e-98de-325c3de8abe31.jpg" width="500" height="330" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/41ba7692-7a53-468e-98de-325c3de8abe31.jpg 630w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/41ba7692-7a53-468e-98de-325c3de8abe31-300x198.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/41ba7692-7a53-468e-98de-325c3de8abe31-262x173.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/41ba7692-7a53-468e-98de-325c3de8abe31-574x379.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<blockquote><p>Keep people off balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.</p></blockquote>
<p>“I’m just looking for a really sweet guy to be in a relationship with me,” AKA she wants some beta chump to shell out the dough while she bangs some bad boy alpha male on the side. I recall reading a study that showed 35% of children were had from an affair. This does not surprise me.</p>
<p>Women are absolute masters at concealing their intentions. They want to use you for money, but say that they want a relationship. They want to use you for validation, but act as if they’re sexually interested in you. They want to use you for power, but act like they love you for your charming personality.</p>
<p>Women are like chameleons; they can blend in to whatever environment they’re thrown in, and can easily manipulate men by acting as if they have the most innocent of intentions. The solution: realize that women aren’t angels. As simple as this revelation is, most men don’t ever come anywhere near attaining it. Sure, if you confront them about their views on women they may SAY they don’t think women are angels, but if you look at their behavior, it begs to differ.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=718" target="_blank">Learn to establish firm boundaries</a>. When you know exactly what you will and will not tolerate from women, they step in line real quick. Don’t ever invest time or energy into women who claim they’re into you, but don’t prove it by sleeping with you.</p>
<p>I personally rarely take women on dates, and when I do, it’s something quick and cheap, like coffee. If we don’t bang after the second date, I’m out—this isn’t mean, it isn’t cruel, it isn’t “using women,” it’s just realizing that they’re using YOU.</p>
<h3>Law #8: Make Other People Come to You—Use Bait If Necessary</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96916" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11.jpg" width="500" height="330" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11.jpg 1163w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11-300x198.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11-768x507.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11-837x553.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11-667x440.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11-262x173.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/WxJYyAFIQ11-574x379.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<blockquote><p>When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him in with fabulous gains—then attack. You hold the cards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Women, of course, are natural masters at using the most alluring bait of all time: sex. Without this one little card to play, they would be completely powerless. But, alas, this card is not going to vanish anytime soon.</p>
<p>Women have always used sex to lure men. Whether they’re luring you into a relationship, luring you into marriage, luring you into chasing them, or luring you into paying for them, you can pretty much guarantee that they’re luring you in for something. Solution: learn game. When you learn game, rather than you desperately wanting her, SHE desperately wants YOU. There are only a handful of men out there who can accomplish this radical switch of roles, but those who can are not lured in by women promising them sex.</p>
<p>Rather, they’re the ones doing the luring. They’re not chasing women, women are chasing THEM. So, go out and learn game. Learn how to properly pass a woman’s shit tests, learn <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1758" target="_blank">how to make women wet just by talking</a>, and learn how to babystep them from the bars to your bedroom.</p>
<h3>Law #11: Learn to Keep People Dependent On You</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96917" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-leash-collar-dog-halter-stockfresh1.jpg" alt="Couple role playing with dog leash" width="500" height="280" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-leash-collar-dog-halter-stockfresh1.jpg 750w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-leash-collar-dog-halter-stockfresh1-300x168.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-leash-collar-dog-halter-stockfresh1-667x374.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-leash-collar-dog-halter-stockfresh1-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/man-leash-collar-dog-halter-stockfresh1-574x321.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<blockquote><p>To maintain your independence, you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough so they can do without you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most guys out there follow a very, very similar pattern. They start off as completely socially awkward virgins, and slowly go through the process of learning game. Then, much to their surprise, they end up with a girlfriend.</p>
<p>But, unfortunately, most men then stop practicing game. Their skills grow rusty, and she can sense this. Soon enough, she’s got you completely dependent on her for sex, since you haven’t gone out and practiced game in a while…and she loves it.</p>

<div style="float: none; margin:20px 0 20px 0; text-align:center;">
 <div id="M322148ScriptRootC225781"> <div id="M322148PreloadC225781">  </div> <script> (function(){ var D=new Date(),d=document,b='body',ce='createElement',ac='appendChild',st='style',ds='display',n='none',gi='getElementById'; var i=d[ce]('iframe');i[st][ds]=n;d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781")[ac](i);try{var iw=i.contentWindow.document;iw.open();iw.writeln("<ht"+"ml><bo"+"dy>"+"dy>"+"ml>");iw.close();var c=iw[b];} catch(e){var iw=d;var c=d[gi]("M322148ScriptRootC225781");}var dv=iw[ce]('div');dv.id="MG_ID";dv[st][ds]=n;dv.innerHTML=225781;c[ac](dv); var s=iw[ce]('script');s.async='async';s.defer='defer';s.charset='utf-8';s.src="//jsc.mgid.com/r/e/returnofkings.com.225781.js?t="+D.getYear()+D.getMonth()+D.getUTCDate()+D.getUTCHours();c[ac](s);})(); </script> </div> 
</div>
<p>The second that a woman senses you can’t find another girl, she will completely walk all over you. She’ll make you buy her expensive earrings, take her out to fancy dinners, rub her feet, watch romantic comedies with her…and eventually, she’ll <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/96740/return-of-kings-correctly-predicts-the-demise-of-anthony-bourdains-marriage" target="_blank">cuck your ass worse than Anthony Bourdain</a>.</p>
<p>The solution? Live in abundance. Don’t ever stop practicing game. Always be out learning, flirting with women, and improving your skill set. Get good at talking with women, get good at teasing them, and <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1031" target="_blank">practice hobbies that will get you laid</a>. Do whatever it takes to always have a steady stream of women in your life.</p>
<p>When you depend on a woman for sex, without her depending on you for money, terrible things happen. This is one of the reason why our society is so ass-backwards nowadays. Men need women for sex, but women need men for nothing. The government (through welfare and alimony) is effectively creating a one-sided dependency of men on women.</p>
<h3>Law #20: Do Not Commit To Anyone</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96918" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021.jpg" width="500" height="333" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021.jpg 1012w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021-300x200.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021-768x512.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021-837x558.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021-667x445.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021-262x175.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/39520021-574x383.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<blockquote><p>It is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining your independence, you become the master of others; playing people against one another, making them pursue you.</p></blockquote>
<p>“I think I’m free later!” “Maybe! Text me later and I’ll let you know.” “I kind of just got out of a relationship, but I like you.”</p>
<p>How many times have you heard women speak these seemingly innocent comments? Whether it be the coyish girl who’s keeping her options open, or the classic gold digger who wants you to shell out the dough for her, virtually every single woman uses this tactic on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As others have pointed out, there is an <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/32187/the-epidemic-of-flaking" target="_blank">epidemic of flakiness</a> in the Western world due to a complete lack of female accountability. Women constantly use men like tissues, keeping them on the hook so that she can have a shoulder to cry on, or someone to pay for her dinner when she pleases. Despite what you may believe, you are not “so close” to sleeping with her. If she’s flaked on you more than once, she isn’t into you. But, girls are aware that you might catch on, so they throw you a little bait. “I’m sorry I’ve been so flaky, I’m just super busy! We should grab lunch some time!” Haha, yeah right.</p>
<p>The solution: become an alpha male. A lot of guys might say that you should flake on women in retribution, or ignore her texts for a certain period of time, or learn to tell the signs that a girl is using you. These are all great approaches, but in my opinion, they’re hacking at the branches rather than the root.</p>
<p>When you simply <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=581" target="_blank">focus on becoming an alpha male</a>, women take a back seat. You focus on enhancing your life, your business, and your body, rather than chasing women. And, naturally, they’ll sense this—women can sense when they aren’t your number one priority, and it drives them crazy.</p>
<p>You’ve got to hit the gym, but she wants to hang out? Tell her to come over later. She’s inviting you out, but you’ve got an important business meeting the next morning? Tell her it can wait. Or maybe she’s trying to get you to chase her? Just ignore her.</p>
<p>Trust me, boys. If you do these things, soon enough, women will be flaking on other guys for YOU.</p>
<h3>Law #46: Never Appear Too Perfect</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-96919" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stockfresh_1387105_crying-girl_sizeS1.jpg" alt="Crying girl" width="500" height="280" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stockfresh_1387105_crying-girl_sizeS1.jpg 750w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stockfresh_1387105_crying-girl_sizeS1-300x168.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stockfresh_1387105_crying-girl_sizeS1-667x374.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stockfresh_1387105_crying-girl_sizeS1-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/stockfresh_1387105_crying-girl_sizeS1-574x321.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<blockquote><p>Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not every single woman uses this tactic, but the ones who do should be avoided at all costs. It is very typical of women to reveal some seemingly deep, terrible flaw as a way to make you view her as a victim. This is a big mistake.</p>
<p>It took me quite a while to figure out that most of the time when women tell me that they were “horribly raped,” really they’re just trying to gain my sympathy. In reality, they banged some dude in the bathroom, don’t want to feel like a slut, and so they lie about it to make me feel bad for them.</p>
<p>Again, this is a big mistake. Women constantly lie to gain your sympathy. They act weaker than they actually are, as a way to make you protect them and fight their own battles for them. They act tired, hoping that you’ll clean the house “just this once.” They act dumb, as if they don’t know how to properly cook your dinner, so that you’ll do it for them.</p>
<p>Solution: DO NOT fall for these traps. Yeah, sure, some women genuinely do have a lot of flaws, but here’s the key: those that are manipulating you won’t ever learn. For example, say that a girl you’re dating doesn’t know how to cook very well, so she asks you to show her. Okay, cool. So you show her how by preparing a meal in front of her. Now, what does she do the next time around? Does she try to cook the meal, but occasionally ask you for advice or help? Then she isn’t manipulating you. But if she acts like a complete retard who never heard anything you said? She’s using you.</p>
<p>Women are masters at taking a mile when you give them an inch. This doesn’t mean to be paranoid—again, sometimes women actually do want to help you and be a good girlfriend, but they just weren’t taught by their mothers so they need some guidance.</p>
<p>But, other times, they’re using the shit out of you. Learn to tell the difference. If she doesn’t improve, or demands more of you, she’s using you.</p>
