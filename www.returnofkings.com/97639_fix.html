<p>The elite-controlled media has been doing their best to use social proof against Trump. Everywhere you look, you’d think that the whole nation hates Trump and thinks he’s a bigot. Every major news station paints him as a fanatical, Hitler-esque, corrupt billionaire, in the hopes that he will lose the upcoming election. Despite this, however, Trump has claimed a massive following that is not only highly vocal in person, but that is also very social-media savvy.</p>
<p>Anyone who meets a lot of people on a regular basis can tell that Trump is winning, and at the very least, tying with Hillary. The media has tried its best to skew polls and manipulate sample sizes, but despite this, Trump has been leading nationally in several polls.</p>
<p>It seems that no matter how hard the elites try, they cannot stop the overwhelming support for Trump from shining through. Here’s why.</p>
<h3>1. Men Are Starting To Wake Up</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-97642" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot.jpeg" alt="fagot" width="500" height="355" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot.jpeg 1084w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot-300x213.jpeg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot-768x546.jpeg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot-837x595.jpeg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot-667x474.jpeg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot-262x186.jpeg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fagot-574x408.jpeg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>Over the past decade, more and more men all across the Western world have started to wake up. A growing number of men has started to realize that all of our politicians are corrupt, our rights are slowly being eroded, and our hyper-feminine, overly-PC culture prevents us from expressing our masculinity.</p>
<p>There’s a number of catalysts for this awakening—some men have it forced upon them, after a terrible divorce or relationship. Some are <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1164" target="_blank">exposed to the manosphere at a young age</a>, leading to a more easy acceptance of the truth. Others are fed up with the system, and can now get news that’s actually true via the alt-media.</p>
<p>Regardless of the cause, tens of thousands, if not millions of men all across the West have started to wake up—and it isn’t just limited to the US, by the way. Men in great Britain, our motherland, woke up as was made so clear with Farage’s piercing comments to the UN as well as his leadership which led to Brexit.</p>
<p>And here, in the US, we look around us and what do we see? An unprecedented number of mentally ill individuals, an economy decimated by years of irresponsible policies and handouts, an increasingly divided culture due to high immigration, and seemingly no chance to save it…until Trump. He is the antithesis of all that the left is: where the left panders to the childish demands of SJW’s, Trump stands tall and laughs at them, as a father would laugh at a child trying to argue his way into power.</p>
<p>Where the left has attempted to destroy our economy with anti-business policies, ample welfare, and a high dose of bread and circus, Trump has declared: “No more!” and wishes to bring the jobs back with conservative fiscal policies.</p>
<p>And perhaps, most importantly, where the left has cucked our nation out to third world immigrants, Trump has declared that he will build a wall—an act that may very well be necessary to save our country.</p>
<p>Trump is the antithesis of all that the left is, and the men of America can see this; we’re tired of effeminate, weak, spineless men who give into even the slightest social pressure. We want a strong, virtuous man to be our leader, and that’s who Trump is.</p>
<h3>2. Trump Tells It How It Is</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-97643" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691.jpg" alt="150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691" width="500" height="281" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691.jpg 1100w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691-300x169.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691-768x432.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691-837x471.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691-667x375.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691-262x147.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/09/150807112010-debate-gfx-trump-super-1691-574x323.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></p>
<p>In a world of political correctness, where politicians are forced to refer to mentally ill individuals as “feminists,” and to call illegal immigrants “Americans,” Trump is a breath of fresh air. He does not speak with fluff, he does not sprinkle truth onto a giant lie, he’s just blunt.</p>
<p>The media, of course, tries to turn this into a weakness: “Oh, didn’t you hear that Donald Trump said THIS?!” or “Oh didn’t you hear that Donald Trump said this about that group of people?!” But, my previous point shows, men have woken up—and they can see past this.</p>
<p>Trump tells it how it is, without frills, and the left hates this. Do you recall when Trump said that Mexico is not sending us their best illegal immigrants? They’re sending us crime, drugs, and rapists? Then, do you remember how the left skewed his words and claimed that he called every single Mexican a drug dealer and a rapist? This is the left’s only strategy against him. Because he speaks the truth so clearly and overtly, their only strategy of attack is to simply lie about him.</p>
<p>It’s difficult for me to even fathom how someone could disagree with Trump’s statement. It’s just a simple statistical fact that most illegal immigrants are either fugitives, drug dealers, or rapists—and they come here, because they know that our politicians will pander to them.</p>
<p>This is a simple fact, and should be stated simply, as Trump has done. This is just one example of his many blunt statements. Another might be this:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster and you’re going to increase regulations all over the place… You’re going to regulate these businesses out of existence… I’m going to cut taxes big league and you’re going to raise taxes big league, end of story.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was, of course, in reference to Hillary’s tax policies. Hillary spouts a whole bunch of feel-good nonsense without ever answering any of Lester’s questions, and yet somehow the media completely twists this fact and claims that Trump is the one who did this. I believe that this quote clearly says otherwise.</p>

<p>Hillary is going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. This is true. She is going to drive businesses out. This is true. She’s going to regulate business out of existence, and he’s going to bring them back by cutting taxes… this is true.</p>
<p>Literally everything that Trump says is of the most obvious truth, yet somehow the left cannot even wrap their monkey-brains around it. So, like a child who stubbornly refuses to accept reality, they proclaim that Trump interrupted her, and that he’s a misogynist.</p>
<h3>3. Men Are Fed Up With Illegal Immigrants</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-97644" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Trump1.gif" alt="trump1" width="500" height="281"></p>
<p>For decades, the silent majority of men has loathed how easy it is for immigrants to enter into this country. An illegal immigrant jumps the border, and pops out a baby? Oh, what do you know! A new American! Give me a break—men are sick and tired of literally millions of unregistered, tax-leeching immigrants that refuse to assimilate.</p>
<p>Not to mention all of the crime they bring (which, again, Donald put so bluntly). Between 2008 and 2014, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/08/08/illegal-alien-crime-accounts-for-over-30-of-murders-in-some-states/" target="_blank">according to Breitbart News</a>, illegal immigrants accounted for a whopping 38% of all murder convictions in California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, and New York, while they only accounted for 5.6% of the population in those states.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Obama administration grossly under-reported the amount of crime that illegal immigrants committed in 2014. Again, according to Breitbart News, the Obama administration only reported 1/10th of the total crimes that they committed.</p>
<p>And need I mention the individual cases of horrendous crimes? In 2016, Sarah Root, a 4.0 GPA college graduate was <a href="http://www.fairus.org/issue/examples-of-serious-crimes-by-illegal-aliens" target="_blank">murdered in a car crash</a> by a low-life immigrant who was street racing for jollies. In 2007, Tessa Tranchant, a 16 year old girl, was murdered by Alfredo Ramos, an illegal immigrant who was driving recklessly while intoxicated. And don’t even get me started on the illegal immigrants who’ve brutally raped and murdered female youth.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on, yet despite this, the mainstream cuck-controlled media claims that Trump is “xenophobic,” and “racist.” Give me a break—we’re not idiots, Mr. Soros. We can see through your globalist plans, and we do not intend on sacrificing our country so that millions of illegal immigrants can destroy our economy, rape our women, murder our families, and ruin our nation.</p>
<p>Trump’s single biggest advantage is his no-holds-barred approach to combating our nation’s single biggest threat: illegal immigration.</p>
<h3>4. Masculinity Is Rising</h3>

<p>There is an esoteric sociological theory which postulates that societies oscillate through periods of being hyper-masculine and hyper-feminine. When a nation is founded, it starts off as hyper-masculine: virtues such as decisiveness, assertiveness, honor, and strength are praised.</p>
<p>Then, as the society grows more stable and safe, it becomes hyper-feminine: virtues such as receptivity, passivity, empathy, and cohesion are praised. Over time, however, the nation becomes too feminine to protect itself, and one of two things can happen.</p>
<p>It can either collapse, such as the British empire, the Turkish empire, or the Ottoman empire, or it can experience a resurgence of masculine vitality, such as is evident in the transition of the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire. This is what I believe will happen with America.</p>
<p>Ever since the 1980’s, there has been a resurgence of masculinity, beginning with the men’s mythopoetic movement, a movement which asked questions such as: What is a man in spirit? What can we learn from the masculine myths of the past?</p>
<p>Now, 30 years later, I look around me and I feel hope. I see a resurgence of <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=589" target="_blank">no-frills powerlifting</a>, because men want to be strong, not only physically, but mentally and emotionally. I see men refusing to accept easy truths, and daring to dive deeper, only to find that these “hard to accept” truths actually enhance your life beyond what you thought possible.</p>
<p>I see men dropping out of the system, because they’ve realized that you can’t win and that it isn’t satisfying to live your whole life as a cog in the machine. I see men taking control of their love lives by learning about the tests that women put them through, going out and learning game, and <a href="http://www.masculinedevelopment.com/?p=1088" target="_blank">striving to change their lack of masculinity</a>.</p>
<p>But most of all, I see men who want to reclaim their nation. I see men going out of their way to vocalize their support of Trump, I see men who refuse to bend over and let the waves of illegal immigrants decimate our country. I see men who refuse to cow-tow to political correctness, and most of all…I see men who want to take their country back.</p>
