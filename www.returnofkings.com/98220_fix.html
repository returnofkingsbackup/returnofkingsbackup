<p>On Friday, our globalist elite released their most withering attack yet on Donald Trump: A ten-year-old recording of a private conversation where Trump said the word “pussy.” The coordinated media/Democrat/GOP Establishment firestorm that erupted reveals that these groups ultimately represent the same globalist interests.</p>
<h3>Breaking News: Trump has touched female genitalia</h3>
<p><iframe src="../players.brightcove.net/769341148/E1zVmpNYx_default/index.html%3FvideoId=5161695715001.html" width="300" height="150" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>On Friday, Access Hollywood released a recording of Donald Trump chatting with Billy Bush. During the off-the-record conversation, Trump talked about how much he loves beautiful women and how his stardom enables him have great success in attracting them. Here is what Trump said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful [women]. I just start kissing them, it’s like a magnet. And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Whatever you want. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.</p></blockquote>
<p>After the release of the recording, Trump apologized and pledged to be a better man.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve never said I’m a perfect person, or pretended to be someone I am not. I’ve said and done things I regret, and the words today in this more than a decade old video are one of them. Anyone who knows me, knows these words do not reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize. I’ve travelled the country talking about change for America. My travels have also changed me. I’ve spent time with grieving mothers who have lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I have been humbled by the faith they have placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and I will never, ever let you down.</p></blockquote>
<h3>The coordinated attack begins</h3>

<p>Immediately after the Access Hollywood played the recording, the GOP Establishment went into action with virtually every Republican establishment figure coming out in condemnation of Trump. House Speaker Paul Ryan canceled an event where he was scheduled to appear with Trump. Ryan issued a statement saying: “I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified.” Marco Rubio, who is perhaps best known for his “true conservative” jokes about the size of Trump’s penis tweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Donald’s comments were vulgar, egregious &amp; impossible to justify. No one should ever talk about any woman in those terms, even in private.</p>

<p><script async src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> Jeb Bush, who is still jealous that his low-energy campaign was crushed by Trump, said:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p><script async src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> Mitt Romney, who was too weak to defeat Obama in 2012, got on his moralistic high horse as well:</p>

<p><script async src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> Perhaps the most surprising thing is that one of the heroes of my youth, Arnold Schwarzenegger, took the opportunity to attack Trump by saying that he will not vote for him. Thankfully, Arnold had the good sense to refrain from invoking high morality probably because, like Trump, he too has a reputation for being a pussy grabber.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t just GOP politicians who piled on Trump, cuckservative commentators also joined in on the orchestrated attack. Russell Moore, who is president of the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, became particularly unhinged. On Twitter he called Trump a sexual predator and alleged that any Christians who support Trump are doing harm to the gospel:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The damage done to the gospel this year, by so-called evangelicals, will take longer to recover from than the ’80s TV evangelist scandals.</p>
<p>— Russell Moore (@drmoore) <a href="https://twitter.com/drmoore/status/784825668257316873">October 8, 2016</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><script async src="../platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> Kevin Williamson of National Review, who has been waging a holy war against Trump dropped readers a note to say, “I told you so.”</p>
<blockquote><p>Americans and Republicans, remember: You asked for this. Given the choice between a dozen solid conservatives and one Clinton-supporting con artist and game-show host, you chose the con artist. You chose him freely. Nobody made you do it.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Coordination</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-98237" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4-300x209.jpg" alt="ctsokravmaehyu4" width="386" height="269" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4-300x209.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4-768x535.jpg 768w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4-837x583.jpg 837w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4-667x465.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4-262x182.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4-574x400.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CtsOkRaVMAEHYU4.jpg 952w" sizes="(max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px"></p>
<p>The above comments are only a small sample of the dozens of denunciations by the GOP establishment politicians and associated cuckservative commentators. Not a single one broke ranks and tried to provide an alternative perspective. It is obvious that this was a coordinated attack. But if it is an attack, who is responsible for coordinating it? It is no secret that while the Democrats and Republicans differ on a few social issues, on other issues such as foreign policy and tax shelters for the very wealthy, they are identical. That’s because both the Democrat and Republican establishments, including the lobbying and pundit class, are dependent on a small group of wealthy donors.</p>
<p>These globalist oligarchs fund both establishment parties to ensure that the elite agenda remains whether the politicians have a D or R behind their name. As <a href="http://honoranddaring.com/trumps-candidacy-test-runs-us-people-oligarchs/">I wrote back in March</a>, Trump’s candidacy is the first real threat to the elites’ complete control of US policy. These same oligarchs own all the major media outlets. It was a simple matter for them to pass on the word that everyone needs to join in this attempt to destroy Trump. The release of the Trump comments at this time was also an opportunity to attempt to bury the latest Wikileaks which reveal the depth of Hillary’s corruption. I strongly encourage readers to check out <a href="http://mattforney.com/john-podesta-hillary-clinton/">Matt Forney’s definitive coverage of the leaks</a>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While Trump’s words were rude, they are not anything that shocking to anyone who has either served in the military or participated in a high school team sport. Men since the beginning of time have been boasting of their prowess with women. A priest who had served in Iraq tweeted that anyone who was feigning offense at Trump’s comments was a prissy. If our standard for President is a man who has never committed a sin, then our selection will be extremely limited. About half of our presidents, including some of the best ones, cheated on their wives. Hillary’s husband, who many liberals adore, is not just a serial womanizer, but has even been accused of rape on many occasions.</p>
<p>The US is at a critical point in its history. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/97947/what-you-need-to-do-if-hillary-wins">The election of Hillary will result in gigantic, permanent changes to the country</a>. For that reason, I hope Trump will weather this storm.</p>
