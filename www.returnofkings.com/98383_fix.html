<p>Western females today simply do not respond well to good treatment from their significant others. Call her beautiful, she gets big headed, stops trying to look good for you, and starts packing on the pounds. Be attentive to her needs, she calls you clingy. Send her good morning texts every day, and her responses become less frequent and further apart. The list goes on and on but you get the idea.</p>
<div id="attachment_98823" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-98823 size-medium" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flowers-300x250.jpg" alt="flowers" width="300" height="250" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flowers-300x250.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flowers-262x218.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flowers-574x478.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/flowers.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Today’s female responds poorly to attentiveness.</p>
</div>
<p>On the flip side, telling her she’s looks “alright”, being completely selfish by ignoring her needs in favor of your own, and texting every few hours (or whenever the hell you feel like it) will make her vagina buzz like a bee hive while eliciting the kind of loyal behavior we used to dream about as sexless beta boys. What a messed up society we live in.</p>
<p>Infidelity is the ultimate slap in the face to men and women alike. However, the effect is very different between the sexes. Most of us here know and understand how a cheating woman <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/58132/how-forgetting-my-game-because-of-a-woman-almost-ruined-my-life">affects us as men</a>. But females are affected very differently by infidelity. The truth is, the fallout for a cheating male actually works in his favor more often than he realizes. Below are the three most advantageous reasons for a man to step out on a low-quality woman.</p>
<h3>1. She needs to know you have balls</h3>
<div style="width: 399px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ff/2d/80/ff2d800c4a5bb689ed59da56a212a5d0.jpg" alt="...or backbone" width="389" height="407"><p class="wp-caption-text">…or backbone</p>
</div>
<p>Most men in this part of the world won’t so much as verbally disagree with his female or even raise his voice at her. Men like this are fearful of the proverbial shit storm they’re sure will ensue if they upset the applecart. For this reason they live in a perpetual state of discontentment caused by this fear.</p>
<p>A man in a relationship where he’s afraid to check his woman for any reason will lose the single most important element in in keeping her loyal: respect. <b><i>A woman cannot love a man she does not respect</i></b>. It can’t be done. And if a man doesn’t have any backbone, his woman can’t respect him let alone love him.</p>
<p>According to women, two of the worst things a man can do to a woman within the context of a sexual relationship is physical abuse, and infidelity. But knowing what we know about women tells us that that these two ‘crimes’ keep them around a hell of a lot longer than the opposites. I’ve addressed the effects of physical abuse towards women in a <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/74207/3-reasons-women-stay-with-abusive-men">previous post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>…the adrenaline rush that comes with the unpredictability of her lover’s volatile mood keeps her on her toes and for better or worse it keeps her around.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nobody here condones hitting women, but the hard truth is that battered women respect their abusers more than any man in their lives and it’s as simple as that. A man who won’t put his hands on a female won’t get as much respect from said female as a man who does. Sad but true.</p>
<div style="width: 524px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="http://havenhousefsc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/domestic-violence.jpg" alt="Before you get your panties in a bunch, nobody here condones this behavior." width="514" height="316"><p class="wp-caption-text">Before you get your panties in a bunch, nobody here condones this behavior.</p>
</div>
<p>Infidelity works exactly the same way. If your woman doesn’t think you’ll cheat on her, or worse, doesn’t think you <em>could</em> cheat on her she loses respect and attraction for you. Similar to raising your voice at her or being physically abusive, it shows her that you have the ability to grab your Y chromosome, show some testicular fortitude and won’t hesitate to do so if the situation warrants.</p>
<p>No, she’s not gonna like it when she finds out you were balls deep in your side chick last night. Yes, she’ll cry and scream and throw a tantrum. But she’ll be infinitely more loyal to you than her ex who told her he’d never dream of cheating on her because he loved her ‘more than life itself.’</p>
<h3>2. “Post-selection”</h3>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/man-checking-out-woman.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="322"></p>
<p>Men who frequent this and other sites like it are familiar with the concept of pre-selection. We’re all aware that if a woman sees that you have the respect and adoration of attractive women, she’ll become more attracted to you because she sees that high value women have signed off on you.</p>
<p>I’ve written about the concept of ‘post-selection’ and how it can sometimes hinder a man’s endeavors with the second sex. <a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/71547/flaws-i-have-discovered-in-red-pill-game-doctrines">Including my own</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pre-selection works wonders <em>before</em> you hook up, but “post-selection” can and will burn you if you don’t take the necessary measures to avoid your current stable from witnessing your exploits with other girls.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the best relationships get a little stale at some point. It could be because of weight gain from either or both parties, being around each other too much, general boredom, or any number of reasons. One such reason that sticks out is that her attraction to you has dwindled because she hasn’t seen any glimpses of that pre-selection that drew her to you in the first place.</p>
<p>You’ve been so focused on her and only her you don’t take to flirting with other girls or exhibiting the domineering persona that grabs and holds the attention of attractive females. At some point her hamster starts to spin and subconsciously puts thoughts into her head like:<em> “Is he really the best I can do right now?”</em> or <em>“Is he really as attractive as I thought he was?”</em></p>

</div>
<p>Sticking your dick in another chick indirectly makes both of those answers emphatic yes’s. Your girl finding out you’ve been humping around will remind her that she’s not the only woman who finds you attractive enough to sleep with. And if your side chick is attractive it solidifies the fact that you are the best she can do.</p>
<p>Again, she’ll cry, she’ll scream, she’ll call you names, and she may even break up with you. But you can bet your bottom dollar that as she’s crying in her beta orbiter’s arms she’s wishing his arms were yours. And if you’re a high value male with game and in good shape, you can just about guarantee she’ll be back with a hell of a lot more loyalty and appreciation for you than before you stepped out on her.</p>
<h3>3. Drama and dread</h3>
<div style="width: 455px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="" src="../reductress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Sad-Woman.jpg" alt="Wet eyes means wet vagina." width="445" height="270"><p class="wp-caption-text">Wet eyes means wet vagina.</p>
</div>
<p>Drama and dread should be two of the lures you use the most in your player tackle box. Any man who regularly sleeps with beautiful women knows that if there’s no drama, she’s bored. He also knows that if she’s feels ‘secure’ in the relationship, she gets complacent.</p>
<p>Boredom and complacency is a recipe for all sorts of shenanigans. Weight gain, bitchiness, granny panties, cheating, etc. are always floating at or near the surface anyway. But if your relationship becomes mundane she’ll find a way to change that by any means possible with the aforementioned behaviors.</p>
<p>Engaging in debauchery with another girl is sure to create both drama and dread. When she finds out about your affair there will be plenty of fireworks like I’ve discussed before. In addition, she’ll tell anyone who’ll listen to her drone on and on about her “scumbag boyfriend who cheated on me with that slut!” and she’ll tell the tale as dramatically as a broadway actress.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-medium" src="../i1.ytimg.com/sh/YtTpU7GXss0/showposter.jpg%3Fv=526e5175" alt="" width="300" height="300"></p>
<p>Cheating also activates dread. In my personal experience nothing, and I mean nothing has been more effective in keeping my female(s) in line than good old fashioned dread game and there are a few levels to it:</p>
<p>Level 1: Flirting with other chicks in front of your girl. When she sees this behavior she may call you out on it, she may not. But she’ll be motivated to step up her game because she sees that you can and will replace her if she doesn’t keep her shit together.</p>
<p>Level 2: Texting or talking (on the phone) to other girls in front of your girl. This is a bold move but again, if she ain’t actin’ right she needs to be reminded that you could skate at any time. Just use the age old ‘She’s just a friend’ or ‘Relax, it’s not like I’m fucking her.’ Pause after that second one and say ‘yet’ while looking her right in the eye with a slight smirk and I can guarantee she’ll suck the soul out of you that night.</p>
<p>Level 3: Cheating. This is maximum level dread game. It’s one thing to flirt with or text other chicks. It’s quite another to actually do the dirty with one of them. The former just sends a message…the latter confirms it.</p>
<p>I’ve said it twice and I’ll say it again. Your girl willl cry, she will scream, she will call you names, she will dump you, she will throw things at you, and she will rue the day she met you. But when the smoke clears (and that could take few days) she’ll love and respect you tenfold.</p>
<h3>The reality of infidelity is…</h3>
<p>…that it could end your relationship in a hurry. Sure, you’ll earn her respect and adoration for having the balls to step out on her but the fact of the matter is that it could still blow up in your face…at least initially. You may want to save it for a normal, broken, Western woman.</p>
<p>The shenanigans that are sure to follow when she learns of your treachery will test your mettle. But as I’ve stated in this column multiple times, and in a<a href="http://www.returnofkings.com/76238/3-ways-to-keep-your-woman-from-cheating"> previous post</a>, don’t give in and apologize lest you lose the <strong>respect</strong> you’ve acquired:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the smoke clears you may have a headache but you’ll definitely have her <strong>respect,</strong> which is probably the single most important element to keep your woman from running around on you.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve all heard stories about this girl or that who stays with ‘that cheating bastard’ despite her friends telling her to leave him. One of the many reasons she won’t is because he’s exhibiting the kind of masculinity and fearlessness only a small percentage of men can show these days.</p>
<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="size-medium" src="http://cdn.gurl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/girls-arguing.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250"><p class="wp-caption-text">“Why don’t you leave him already??”</p>
</div>
<p>I’m not going to tell you that your woman will never leave you or that she won’t go and sleep with someone else because of your adultery. Cheating on your girl could result in some unintended consequences to be sure. But at the end of the day females respect, admire, and obsess over men who show that they are unafraid of them and don’t sweat it if the so-called relationship ends in a whirlwind of drama and tears because of infidelity and/or abuse.</p>
<p>If nothing else, we know they’re a hell of a lot more loyal to those men than betas who end things amicably, wouldn’t lay a hand on them, or ‘even dream about so much as looking at another woman!’</p>
