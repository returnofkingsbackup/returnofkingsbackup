<p>For the longest time I held in high esteem those who worked in distinguished institutions. I’d revere the Congressman, New York Times journalist, think tank strategist, anthropology professor, non-profit director, and literary novelist. They got to where they are through merit, intelligence, and hard work, not through connections, nepotism, or by being a useful idiot for a specific agenda.</p>
<p>My doubt about these servants of the elite increased as <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-war-against-men">the war against men ramped up in earnest</a>, culminating with my many direct interactions with them.  Those encounters confirmed to me that they are no smarter than us, and in some cases, severely lacking in knowledge and context to make better decisions to lead society. Here’s a passage from <a href="http://www.bangguides.com/other/free-speech-isnt-free?utm_source=rooshv+game+gateway&amp;utm_campaign=free+speech+isnt+free">Free Speech Isn’t Free</a> where I try explaining to a well-known think tank commentator that the homosexual agenda is deliberate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s hard to see the problem from your nice office here when you associate with people who are not touched by these issues, or if you only read mainstream media outlets, but I’m meeting with hundreds of men on this tour alone and I have interacted with thousands more through the internet. We clearly see the absurdity of lifting all other groups in society except for men, while we are forced to suffer under policies that stem from hatred. No one has the backs of men except a few lone voices like myself, and that’s shameful.”</p>
<p>She was taking notes. I continued. “For example, look at the homosexual issue. Suddenly for the past five years, the needs of 3% of the population have become a huge, all-encompassing matter, where they are deemed more worthy of money and beneficial social policies than the men who compose nearly 50% of the population, with a complete coordination of all major institutions to re-write legal codes and cultural norms to accommodate their alternative lifestyle.”</p>
<p>“Oh that, well that issue just went viral.” She genuinely thought the homosexual agenda’s ascension into mainstream life was like how a funny cat video gets ten million views on Youtube.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Individuals such as herself would also think that groups like Black Lives Matter and ISIS are “spontaneous,” developing out of thin air without deliberate planning, coordination, or funding behind them. Of course you know that this is not the case: Black Lives Matter <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2913625/Billionaire-George-Soros-spent-33MILLION-bankrolling-Ferguson-demonstrators-create-echo-chamber-drive-national-protests.html">is funded by George Soros</a> to destabilize the United States while ISIS <a href="https://theconservativetreehouse.com/2016/08/13/senator-rand-paul-discusses-potential-for-clinton-indictment-based-on-wikileaks-claim/">was initially armed by the United States</a> and funded <a href="http://observer.com/2016/02/deal-with-the-devil-turkey-props-up-isis-by-buying-its-stolen-oil/">with oil purchases from Turkey</a>. I have no doubt that globalists have heavily donated to homosexual organizations in the past twenty years to advance that cause as well.</p>

<p>When you’re at the very top, you sponsor individuals mainly for their ability to advance a particular cause or objective. There’s no need for them to be the smartest guy in the room. In fact, being <em>too </em>intelligent will actually prevent their hiring because then they will be able to see that their boss doesn’t care about “race equality” but fostering race inequality. He doesn’t care about “love not hate” but <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/the-end-goal-of-western-progressivism-is-depopulation">destroying the family unit</a>. Therefore, to work for the elite, you must have huge blind spots that prevent you from seeing the big picture, or at least be sociopathic enough that you are willing to work for an immoral agenda so that you can get closer to the seats of power.</p>
<p>All the people I mentioned earlier, the journalists, politicians, professors, and think tank insiders, were hired primarily for their <em>usefulness</em> in advancing a specific set of goals. This is where the term useful idiot comes from. As long as a particular journalist can channel the narrative competently, she’s hired. As long as the politician will follow the directives of his sponsor and vote yes on a bill like TPP, he’ll get big campaign donations. As long as the professor infuses <a href="http://www.rooshv.com/what-is-a-social-justice-warrior-sjw">SJW talking points</a> into his lectures, he gets tenure. These individuals have enough intelligence to do their jobs at a standard level, but that is secondary to their usefulness.</p>
<p>Growing up in America, you come to believe that people advance through their merit and ideas, but if you start examining these institutional positions and what allows individuals to rise to the top, you realize that their merit and ideas were only secondary. They were hired because those one level above found them to be useful, and no more. Intelligence is optional, and only necessary if the job demands it, but far more important is the ease of which they can be controlled to help usher in a pre-determined goal.</p>
<p>The biggest barrier to improving your society is thinking that people in influential positions are better or smarter than you. Unless you are unusually dim-witted, and can’t understand what I’m trying to explain to you right now, I assure you they’re not. At the most, they’re more connected than you and more willing to sacrifice their dignity for a chance to control others. Their power mostly stems from the system and structures they inherited, not their own internal strength. Understanding this fact gives you confidence, because if you can survive the onslaught from their institutions, defeating the individuals behind them will be a simple matter. Like a game of whack-a-mole, you just have to take one down at a time, until there are none of them left.</p>
