<p>When a politician isn’t behaving or going along with the elites’ master plan, a coordinated and underhanded rape attack is the first line of offense. The Marxist media, being prostitutes of the elite power structure, specialize in this type of character assassination. Posing as the Fourth Estate while really acting as “for hire” attack dogs is how they make their livings and curry favor with those in the corporate-government complex. When called upon, they collectively aim at a target and commence with “drive by” attacks in 90 second news stories.</p>
<p>It’s really quite easy to perform a character assassination on someone in a sexually repressed culture. Pick an emotional issue, like women being sexually assaulted in a culture that pedestalizes them, and then commence with endless attacks while ignoring Hillary’s endless scandals. That’s exactly what has happened with baseless accusations of sexual misconduct by Donald Trump, repeated and replayed ad nauseum <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2016/10/13/hypocrisy-new-york-times-tries-crush-trump-campaign-sex-harassment">in a last ditch effort to neutralize the threat to globalism posed by his candidacy</a>.</p>
<h3>The “Victims”</h3>
<div id="attachment_98858" style="width: 498px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
<img class="wp-image-98858" src="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Leeds-300x160.jpg" alt="Who will win the biggest victim prize? Jessica Leeds is in the lead" width="488" height="260" srcset="wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Leeds-300x160.jpg 300w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Leeds-667x356.jpg 667w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Leeds-262x140.jpg 262w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Leeds-574x306.jpg 574w, wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Leeds.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px"><p class="wp-caption-text">Who will win the biggest victim prize? Jessica Leeds is in the lead</p>
</div>
<p>Suddenly, a senior citizen named Jessica Leeds, a former stewardess, pops up out of nowhere and is emotionally distraught by a groping that supposedly happened 37 years ago. Except her claim is baseless. She claims Trump “raised an armrest” on a flight she worked then proceeded to grab her, but the first class seats on that flight did not have adjustable armrests.</p>
<p>Not only that, an eyewitness said Leeds was throwing herself at Trump, as women tend to do around rich men but that she got rejected. The press would hear none of that because it would deflate both their agenda and ratings, and it would cast holier than thou females in an unholy light. Eyewitness Anthony Gilberthorpe told the press:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have only met this accuser once and frankly cannot imagine why she is seeking to make out that Trump made sexual advances on her. Not only did he not do so (and I was present at all times) but it was she that was the one being flirtatious.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems the pain of that rejection led her to make up a false story.</p>
<p>Why do the marionettes in the media dig up these old hags and baseless sexual harassment claims? Because it works in a culture in which women can do no wrong. The media even pulled a sexual harassment character assassination attempt back in 2008 with the old battle horse John McCain.</p>
<p>Here’s how they did it. The New York Times did a hit piece featuring Vicki Iseman accusing John McCain of sexual conduct. Here’s the kicker: <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/19/AR2009021903112.html">The New York Times later settled a libel suit brought on by Iseman after the campaign had ended</a>.</em> This is how big media and big politics operate.</p>
<p>The veracity of the claims matter little to a gaggle of “journalists” who would slit someone’s throat for a scoop. Similar to the documented practice of some fireman to set fires to keep their jobs, the media create scandals to gin up ratings and dehumanize those not going by the New World Order playbook.</p>
<p>Predictably, once one woman gets the ball rolling, a dogpile of victims ensues in a culture that lionizes victims instead of winners.</p>

<p>Mindy McGilliavray came out and told the press Trump “nudged” her. She told the fellow travelers in the media:</p>

<blockquote><p>All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it’s Ken’s camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there’s Donald. He sort of looked away quickly. I quickly turned back, facing Ray Charles, and I’m stunned. This was a pretty good nudge. More of a grab. It was pretty close to the center of my butt. I was startled. I jumped.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, kino works that way, especially for billionaires. That’s assuming it’s true. It’s funny that instead of confronting The Donald immediately she waited 13 years to bring it up.</p>
<p>Kristen Anderson claimed Trump grabbed her vagina.</p>
<p>Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos claims Trump harassed her, even though she kept in contact with him and even sought out Donald’s help with her business. If she was emotionally scarred by Trump, why would she continue to associate herself with him?</p>

<p>An old saying, common amongst jaded idealists when I worked in this soulless industry known as mass media was <strong>never let the facts get in the way of a good story</strong>. Believe it. That’s how the industry operates. No scandals, no ratings, no job. Bias is also clearly an issue since <a href="https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/nb/tim-graham/2016/10/17/tilt-study-journalist-donations-president-find-more-96-went-hillary">96% of campaign donations from journalists have gone to the Hillary campaign</a>, as reported by NewsBusters.</p>
<p>The Gateway Pundit knows their conniving modis operandi well.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The media clearly did not fact check these stories.</strong> They ran the stories no matter how farfetched they were. It is clear from the number of stories dropped in the last week that this was a coordinated effort, probably from inside the Hillary Clinton campaign. The goal was not to present facts to the public. Their goal was to destroy Donald Trump.</p></blockquote>
<p>These pseudo scandals could have raged on unendingly in the past, except the Internet is now exposing most journalists as the frauds they are. But don’t think the elite are content to let us talk amongst ourselves and figure out the ruse. Just last week President Obama foreshadowed the coming censorship that’s sure to be implemented once The Bitch begins her reign of terror.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are going to have to rebuild within this wild-wild-west-of-information flow some sort of curating function that people agree to. There has to be, I think, some sort of way in which we can sort through information that passes some basic truthiness tests and those that we have to discard, because they just don’t have any basis in anything that’s actually happening in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: Anything written that’s not approved of by the elite is not the “truth” according to Obama.</p>
<p>The Democrat Socialists now want government imposed “truth tests” will tell us what to believe and what not to believe on the Internet, and later to vet what gets published and what doesn’t in a supposedly free society. We are fucked as a society if the sheeple let this happen.</p>
<p>It’s only because of the Internet the truth is now known about this thinly veiled attempt to destroy Donald Trump’s chances of winning the election. If we lose the Internet, we lose free speech. Moreover, any man accused of “rape” by Big Media is almost certainly a person the power structure wants to silence for political reasons and to maintain the power structure’s lock grip on the national narrative. Trump is only their latest target, but he certainly won’t be the last.</p>
